Pre-order your copy of Ramsay in 10 here - https://linktr....",2022-11-22 22:16:02.926159, I love cooking for mates but I never made the mistake of doing complicated formal food who wants to be stressed out on the time off however I do have a reputation to keep up so the food has got to be good whether it's breakfast brunch lunch or dinner here's my ultimate food for friends having people over for a bit of a late breakfast or brunch at the weekend is a brilliant way to catch up with friends and this dish is always a winner gorgeous griddle polenta with roasted tomatoes and a creamy ghost curd I can't wait to dive in next a lunch to knock the socks off your mates Sensational salt bait sea bream with easy braised leeks and my middle daughter Holly gets her hands dirty in the kitchen as we cook a super simple dinner guaranteed to be a hit with all your loved ones stunning roast chicken stuffed with aromatic chickpeas a beautiful big green salad and an amazing chocolate and hazelnut meringue Tower really good nice to see Holly get her hands dirty right I think we all agree oh this is my ultimate food for friends breakfast lunch and dinner first I said I suffocated late breakfast or brunch dish to impress your mates easy griddle polenta with delicious roasted tomatoes and creamy goats curd now polenta to the Italians is what mashed potato is to Britain's a staple incredibly delicious and really straightforward to do now season the water it's a little touch of olive oil stops it from becoming too sticky I love polenta it's a cornmeal made from ground dried maize the more coarse the longer it takes to cook but you can also buy instant polenta which is ready in under 10 minutes and always use this at home and then whisk that out as it Cooks out it naturally thickens you can see the grains becoming almost into one nice fine pureed polenta to take the polenta to another level flavor wise season with salt and pepper a good knob of butter and Parmesan the quite generous with the parmesan because blender can be quite dull I like it quite rich and creamy delicious now mix that in no a nice smooth shiny glossy plant you can eat polenta two ways like this it's a glorious fluffy Mash or set then griddled which is what I'm doing start by oiling a baking tray pour in your polenta now get that in the fridge and then it's set next I'm roasting fine tomatoes to really intensify the flavor olive oil on the bottom of the tray and drizzle extra virgin olive oil on top nip your tomatoes with your scissors if you didn't burst them before they went in the oven they'd explode so and pepper garlic just squeeze the juice out the garlic says the tomatoes blister and roast it's going to take on all this lovely garlic to give the tomatoes a wonderful sweet and sour flavor a pinch of sugar and balsamic vinegar this is a wonderful age balsamic vinegar and then some time don't pick the time just trim it like you're having a little haircut nice the tomatoes only take 10 minutes to roast now the plant is set it's ready to griddle should just fall out beautiful blend is a nice garnish for grilled Meats it's great when you're planning a big dinner party the Plenty can be done one or two days before a nice season top and bottom a nice sort of coating of olive oil and then onto your grill now this looks very impressive but it's so easy to do get that Grill really nice and hot make sure you've got a fish slice and go underneath to turn all that nice sort of marking and Char on the blender gives that really nice flavor now tomatoes no you've got these beautiful Vine tomatoes that have been roasted and all that wonderful flavor now get your little tomatoes and just sit them on top drizzle over any remaining roasting juices the perfect addition is a goat's curd goat's curd gives it that nice sort of salty creamy taste goat's cheese cream cheese or creme fraiche will work just as well drizzle a little touch of that age basement vinegar and then a little basil I can't wait to dive in this dish is fantastically entertaining in the morning set your plan to the night before and you can have this casual brunch on the table within minutes fuss-free cooking that looks like a labor of love coming up I've got some great lunch and dinner recipes when you're cooking for a crowd [Music] but first here's a closer look at some of the key ingredients you'll need to impress your friends [Music] keep your guests sweet here's some of the most common sugars and what they're best for almost sticky muscovado sugar rich and trickly in flavor it's great in biscuits fruit cakes and pickles powdery icing sugar dissolves without heat making it perfect for butter creams and icing palm sugar made from the palm tree sap is generally sold as a paste and brings caramely flavors to Sweet and Savory dishes the secret to the meringue I'm serving my mates for dinner is caster sugar part way between granulated and icing sugar in size it dissolves well it's the ultimate sugar for baking for the main course I'm using corn-fed chicken you can buy them everywhere they're great value they have a lovely color and a rich flavor and with an incredible stuffing roast chickens guaranteed to be a crown pleaser sea bream and I think the Kilt head variety with its disco Diva gold flash is the most flavoursome to check it's fresh its eyes should be bright gills red and scales shiny bream's great poached grilled or pan fried but I'm going to bake it in a salt crust for my ultimate lunch for friends when I'm cooking lunch for a crowd of my friends my policy is to keep it simple and think big so instead of making lots of little things I usually cook a whole fish or a large joint of delicious meat that way there's always plenty to go around now you can have this prepared and in the oven before any of your guests arrive it looks super impressive especially when you bring it to the table this is my ultimate lunch for friends salt crusted Sebring served with braised leeks and hazelnuts first job is that salt crust this dish looks intimidating but it is actually very straightforward and very easy make sure the guts are out and the fish is clean the most important thing is always leaving the skin and the scales on that skin protects the actual flesh from becoming salted give the fish a really nice seasoning inside even though we're putting a salt crust on the outside it's still very important to season the middle fennel seeds goes brilliantly well with Fish And then slice the lemon nice large thick slices the zest and the lemon bakes inside the fish fall over the fish and just squeeze the juice now for the salt about 150 mil to 200 mL of water what you're trying to do now is bring the salt together and you want to sort of end up with a bowl of salt that looks almost like snow you'll need about two kilos of salt for this and it doesn't need to be the fancy stuff even though you're using a lot of it it won't make the fish salty instead the crust forms a kill that retains moisture well basically a nice bed of salt underneath flatten it down lay the fish on top of the salt get your salt and just start packing you can salt crust almost any fish from sea bass to Salmon or flatfish like soul but it's not great with oily fish now it looks like a ridiculous amount of salt but it's really important to cover all the fish because you want that nice shell and the minute salt hits the oven it sort of tightens up and forms this large crust that goes in at 180 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes whilst the fish Cooks is onto my beautiful braised leaks splash of olive oil leak is a very sort of firm robust vegetable so it can take a really nice Sear the most exciting thing about these leeks I either go beautifully for deceivering but braised leeks colored properly with a lot of flavor on there tastes absolutely delicious take a couple of cloves of garlic and just crush them in with the leeks some fresh thyme get some butter in there braising them in butter and white wine gives them the most amazing flavor braising as a chefy term for searing at a high temperature then cooking with a bit of liquid bring that up to the boil and then the rest of your butter now as the white wine reduces down the flavor the leeks intensifying they glaze turn it down just leave that little Gap there if we totally covered it then you're gonna get all that condensation underneath the lid and it'll just make the legs watery the leaks will take about 12 minutes to cook so now for the garnish roasted hazelnuts they'll be roasting the oven very brittle very firm so get them inside pesto mortar bit of seasoning and just crush your nuts don't over pound them I just want this nice sort of rustic chopped toasted hazelnuts now get your knife you want that going through with ease and turn off the gas all right absolutely adore them like stunning little parcels soft and slightly creamy now baste the leeks with the remaining butter spread your fat leaf parsley over generously and then just sprinkle The Toasted hazelnuts the combination of that earthiness from the leeks the roasted flavor from the hazelnuts that is a stunning way of eating leeks and now for the fish I'm not now just gently tap the top and it starts falling away you can just see that beautiful shine carefully lift off your salt now peel that skin look how juicy and succulent that Sebring is stays incredibly moist the other great thing about cooking whole fish like this it makes it so easy to fill it your spoon run that down through the top the fish will just slide off there now just push back that lovely fillet and look at that is cooked beautifully and that's what keeps them coming back for more and more and more when you have friends over you want to keep lunch relaxed lay back but impressive and a salt crust brain with beautiful braised leeks is just that one of the things I've learned about running successful restaurants over the past 20 odd years is it's not just the food that keeps people coming back you need to create a great atmosphere too and it's the same at home My ultimate dinner for friends is utterly delicious but it keeps things simple and easy in the kitchen [Music] helping me in the kitchen proving this dinner's Child's Play to make is middle daughter Holly first shop get the chicken stuffed and roasting now we all know you love chicken I do but we're going to do it the way that Daddy used to eat it in Paris okay now I'm gonna hold that up okay season inside please why is it yellow because it's a comfort chicken obviously eats corn and if you eat lots of corn now what are those chickpeas chickpeas yeah have a little taste nice yeah we're gonna make them taste even better salt pepper in there as well please now chilies can you hear that noise was that made the seeds have come out that's right take off the tops we're gonna add the chilies to the chickpeas in and then zest the lemon in there please you love your zest I love my zest the absolutely right a little glug of olive oil come on house don't worry about your nails now come on baby you can do it now time you pick off all those wonderful little buds see so as we stuff the chicken with the fresh thyme the chickpeas become sort of fat and juicy from all that wonderful flavor chickpea stuffing done next we're going to make the herb butter to flavor the skin now what's that Target hmm slightly vinegary yeah yeah a little bit and a CD yeah so imagine that flavor going into the chicken that's gonna be delicious now nice soft butter in with a tarragon is that lovely yeah now I want you gently to put your fingers through there and just so we can get that butter under there but I need those small beautiful little hands what's wrong it's yucky come on holes nice well done I want you get a nice handful of butter oh lift your hand up and push under good now see that there yeah you push it all the way down there and you let that slide and that's how you get all that wonderful yeah butter running down and the breasts stay nice and moist and like you yeah all those chickpeas in there nice your hands have never been so dirty have they no here we go good and push down come on okay now place my lemon in there right take your garlic should I wash my hands no not yet we're gonna eat the garlic onto the tray now onto the garlic salt pepper make your skin nice and crispy and then I'm just going to drizzle some olive oil that'll stop the butter from burning and look at that please open the door thank you everybody and she goes beautiful good job thank you really good it's nice to see Holly get our hands dirty right I think we all agree huh for dessert it's an incredible but easy hazelnut meringue Tower guaranteed to wow your mates start with the basic meringue separate four egg whites [Music] and whisk gradually add caster sugar [Music] until the mix forms stiff glossy Peaks gently folding ground and chopped hazelnuts a trick we use in the restaurants is to use the mix to stick baking sheets down which makes them easy to spread and stops the sheets blowing around top your meringues with more finely chopped hazelnuts and bake for 25 minutes and the trick to stop them cracking is to turn the oven off and let them cool inside for the filling melt dark chocolate in a bowl over simmering water and slightly cool whip the cream until it forms soft peaks and gently fold in three quarters of the melted chocolate until combined build your towel with alternate layers of chocolate cream and meringue [Music] finally drizzle over the remaining melted chocolate to decorate a simple yet luxurious dessert your friends will love but be warned they'll all want second helpings [Music] the chickens in the oven and the desserts sorted now for a big easy green salad so let's start off with one nice tablespoon Dijon a nice little squeeze of honey honey yes and it will Splash oh aged and this is your favorite this one isn't it I just like the it has a nice sweetness but then it has a better Nest to it too nice at least a virgin olive oil why do we have to use a whisk not just a spoon the purpose of using a whisk is so it can emulsify that more importantly you're bringing all the ingredients together taste it's so yummy that is delicious isn't it tip to loosen any vinaigrette and give it a lighter taste is add a spot of water now the juice of a Lemon Squeeze lemon in nice now use some butter lettuce start placing the salad around the outside this one is a lullo Rosso okay so we'll put that one on the inside we're sort of making a nice flower and you put your heart in there that's exactly what I'm trying to do a nice beautiful flower now from there

porridge perfect for a big Comfort family breakfast for lunch I'm pulling out all the stops with a fantastic Twist on one of Britain's favorite comfort dishes ginger beer battered fish with chili minted mushy peas It's Gonna Do It do it properly for dinner my youngest daughter Tilly is in the kitchen and we share the secret ingredient in every comfort food dish happy memories did you like to help Nan make your hot pot when she made them for you always sausage hot pot with beetroot and potato gratins on the menu for dessert spiced apple compot silly we're on for a treat this is my ultimate comfort food breakfast lunch and dinner first up it's breakfast my spiced baked porridge absolutely love it why I grew up with it there's something very Scottish about porridge it's that kind of sort of great start to the day my father used to say porridge needs salt and salt only it separates the men from the boys didn't really like it it was insisted salt puts hairs on it I used to sneak a couple of sugar lumps from cafes and put them in my porridge without him watching these days my porridge has much more flavor than just salt it's packed with fruit nuts and spices add vanilla seeds to porridge oats or oatmeal really important just to rub the vanilla through the oatmeal makes it nice and fragrant now a little teaspoon of cinnamon makes it spicier and then nutmeg [Music] already that smells incredible I quite like making this up week at a time and Jack absolutely loves it now whole almonds now if you don't like that kind of crunch running through the porridge you can chop these up or blend them to a powder but I quite like the sort of texture hazelnuts incredibly good a really nice crunch keep your vanilla pot in there as well that just gives it even more lift and of course once it's baked just pull it out instead of sugar I'm adding sweetness with fruit fresh pears and raisins cranberries are great as well chopped apricots as well dried apricots in there dried mango I love dried fruit next pour in a pint of milk and mix it can be done the night before left in the fridge and then a couple of minutes before you go to bake it add your cream into your dish it looks quite liquid but by the time it bakes has this really nice rich crust on top and then just a nice little nutmeg on top now bake at 180 for 30 to 35 minutes then take the porridge out sprinkle on Demerara sugar and Grill to create a sweet Golden Crust and sort of glaze on top beautiful literally for three to four minutes look at that that makes me feel proud to be Scottish because it's perfect for a big Comfort family breakfast it's Rich it's Sumptuous and it's just a humble oatmeal phenomenal especially in the winter my spiced baked porridge with all those nuts and fruit it's a bowl full of love to start the day [Music] next I'm showing you how to cook the comfort food I crave but first here's a closer look at some of the key ingredients you'll need to make them [Music] My ultimate comfort food has to be sausage I grew up on the classic British Banger made with ground pork salt pepper spices and breadcrumbs and I'm using these ones for dinner the general rule with sausage the higher the meat content the better they'll taste [Music] for my ultimate lunch I'm frying fish so you'll need an oil you can get to a high temperature here are the different oils you can use groundnut oil it's made from peanuts and it's used a lot in Southeast Asian cooking grape seeds made from those yellow flowering crops this has the lowest saturated fat content of any oil and has a lovely delicate flavor sunflower oil made from sunflower seeds is mildly nutty cheap all-rounder with a neutral flavor is vegetable oil which is the blend of oils like corn soybean and sunflower [Music] apples were my favorite fruit growing up originally came from China but today in Britain we grow over 2 000 different types [Music] the most popular eating apples in the UK are Braven and Gala but don't miss out on some of the older types like the sweet nutty russets and fragrant coxes when it comes to cooking apples it's got to be a sharp Bramley which I'm using as part of my compot for lunch you know that feeling when you really want a particular dish and nothing else will do that's comfort food multimet comforting lunch has to be fished with peas I've loved it ever since I was a kid and to make it even more delicious I've given it a few modern tweaks for my Ultimate Fish I'm doing the best crunchiest lightest batter imaginable with a hint of Ginger to go with it chili minted mushy peas [Music] in order to make sure that the batter stays nice and crispy and the fish stays nice and firm the secret is to season the fish salt and pepper that will draw out the moisture and that'll keep the fish really nice and firm put it in the fridge for around 10 minutes to let the seasoning work its magic that the batter as always when making any batter always sieve the flour I want a bit of heat in the batter so a nice teaspoon of cayenne pepper season the flour salt and pepper and then two teaspoons of baking powder this almost lightens the lobe of the batter now ginger beer it gives that batter the sort of unique spicy individual flavor it's delicious for the fish and a nice tablespoon of oil just basic vegetable oil gives it a nice Sheen give that a good mix you really want it almost like the consistency of double cream too thin and the Basset runs off especially when it hits the fryer too thick and it actually prevents the fish from getting cooked so you've got to get it to that just that sort of double cream texture let it rest for as long as possible to give you an even textured batter now the season should have worked its magic and drawn out the excess moisture from the fish so it's on to the next stage fish I was going slightly firm perfect for frying start by coating the fish in flour seasoned with pepper hats that nice and dry into your hands so you haven't got any excess flour the flour stops the batter from running off the fish I'm just gonna check to see if my oil's ready by putting a little touch of batter into the fryer you see it bubbling straight to the very top that tells you that the oil is ready never really ever fill the pan above halfway if the oil starts to get too hot first thing you do turn off the gas second thing add some oil into it to cool it down hold the fish by the corner unless you put it in and roll it round then gently slap the fish on the sides of the bowl to get rid of excess batter now in and lay away and just gently drop it in twist your pan that stops IT from sticking at the bottom oil should be gently sort of bubbling away but notice as we're frying the fish there's no spitting of any water from the fish fry the fish for three to five minutes gently turning halfway through once the batter's golden and crisp it's ready look they look stunning it's like these big crispy pillows of beautifully textured Cod leave the fish to rest on the kitchen towel to blot excess oil meanwhile it's quick and easy chili minted mushy peas now how much your peas a little teaspoon of olive oil nice knob of butter into the pan shallot finely chopped that adds a bit of sweetness to the peas shots into the pan chili these are delicious when you eat peas and they're slightly spicy they're even better garlic in the peas sweat off the chili the garlic and the slots before the peas join those spices simply blanch in salted boiling water infused with their perfect partner fresh mint stalks on all and then put your frozen peas in now what's the piece I've got nice and soft drain them now take off the stalks and then add your peas to the shallots I love that sound mix all that chili and garlic in there a little seasoning finishing the frozen peas off like this absolutely delicious onto your board Crush now you cannot beat crushed delicious peas those peas is incredible chopped mint chili minted mushy peas so simple and perfect with easy ginger beer battered fish a nice spicy crispy batter and that just reaffirms the importance of comfort food if you're going to do it do it properly [Music] my spicy twist is proof you can update a comforting classic and the best way to eat this is with Crispy buttered saute potatoes cooked with garlic Rosemary and Thyme to take this happy food to a whole new level [Music] no question about it the best comfort food is definitely homemade wonderful smells from in the kitchen delicious freshly cooked food and a big side order of nostalgia for me fantastic stews hot pots and puddings will always hit the mark and remind me of my mum that's why I love them my ultimate comforting dinner is a real favorite in our house and I hope it will always remind my kids of me [Music] and joining me in the kitchen to cook the comfort food of my childhood as my youngest daughter Tilly [Music] food dinner is a stunning sausage Hot Pot which will serve with a gorgeous potato and beetroot gratin now I love Hot Pot you love Hot Pot and you love sausages right yeah what'd you enjoy most about sausages just love having them these are little button mushrooms okay you just take them into there like that we keep the hole and cut them into quarters please now the important thing about cooking sausages is they need a bit of color right no color no flavor exactly get the pan nice and hot how was school today school was good thanks we got to go out and mix now sausages in okay buttered mushrooms in there please my darling see now I'm going to watch your fingers but you know how to slice onions right definitely now sausages I get in lots of color because this is going to cook slowly and it's sort of Daddy's version of the kind of hot pot the other one nannies to make for me yeah yeah once you've got the color on them and check them out to rest okay a little knob of butter okay into the pan now it looks like a lot of onions right yeah as they start sweating down they caramelize so that'll go down by half give that a little fry okay salt in I want you to put a nice tablespoon of brown sugar in there that gets them really nice and dark now get your thyme in pick off all the little buds that will get the onions pack the flavor smells nice washrooms in give them a nice little stir did you like to help Nan make your hot pot when she made them for you I used to always help now make the hot pot always now my mum would never have used this but A's balsamic vinegar brings out the flavor of the onions right now look at her onions look beautiful caramelized the vinegar has given that nice sort of gloss I'm gonna put my sausages back in here now from there some red wine red wine in got the flavor underneath there going into the sausages now the sausage is going to release all that flavor inside as well look at the color of that and it's still not cooked yet up to the ball really important to boil it here because it won't boil in the oven 170 in the oven literally 18 to 20 minutes and she goes nice to go with my hot pot Rich golden creamy potato gratin it's a true comfort food classic and I'm adding a delicious twist beetroot start by gently heating double cream [Music] then peel and thinly sliced potatoes and cook beetroot foreign next rub garlic around the edge of your dish to thoroughly season with a glorious flavor then grease with a good layer of butter arrange alternate layers of potato and beetroot seasoning in between [Music] end with a neat layer of potatoes and pour the hot cream over the top bake in a preheated oven for an hour or until the potatoes are tender [Music] potato and beetroot gratin are bubbling beauty of a comfort food dish now for the Apple compod what we need to do first is to get these peeled and sliced I got my pan on to get nice and hot now let me give you a little taste of that thanks for the warning blew my head off they're incredibly acidic okay and you need to cook them those wonderful red apples you've got are called Brae Burns what other apples you know cream ones what are they called um the green ones another word for your nan Grandma's no red no Pink Lady apple no Granny Smith Granny Smith apples that's right what we're gonna do is cook the cooking apples and the eating apples together I love the combination of the tartness from the Bramley cooking apple with the sweetness of the Brae bun get the pan nice and hot sprinkle the bottom of the pan with caster sugar three or four nice slices of fresh ginger and three little cinnamon sticks I want you to remember that because we're going to look for them okay because once we use them and they've worked their magic I need to pull them out see all the sugar dissolving now we just let that go a little bit darker okay and then the place is quick doesn't it give that a nice little toss okay a nice golden color cinnamon in ginger in so we're cooking down the apples butter in gently cook until the apples soften then take off the heat let me go into there what's that coming out Dan so that is a little bit of the puree I'll show you we'll do that in a minute how many Ginger four four Ginger three

Pre-order your copy of Ramsay in 10 here - https://linktr.ee/R...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, we're hoping to wow the family with an amazing quick fig Jam crostini with creamy burrata and the hearty Maine of beef cheek Ragu with Papa Deli Big Cheese just think the size of your little cheeks yeah imagine the size of a cow with them and the cheek is right underneath here yeah um yeah I always give them a really nice season with salt and pepper on there please so beef cheeks very cheap my cut that takes sort of a long time to cook yeah but give it a bit of love let it cook in the oven it comes out like a dream a little touch of oil in the pan what we want to do is get them really nicely colored shed see it into the pan oh cool layaway get what that is um [Music] sitting at the dock of the beach beach and then I want the onion chunky because I'm gonna cook it for like three three and a half hours so you go down down and then again there and there so it doesn't overcook so a really good color on the cheeks like that so how do you cook these at a restaurants if they take so long they go in the oven literally half past six seven o'clock in the morning three and a half four hours ready for lunch and the longer you leave them in their juices yeah and the cooking liquor the better King eyes closed the garlic good onions in and garlic in please nice where's your Bailey there it is get those onions and that garlic really nicely colored put the cheeks back in place right red wine in cool okay the red wine is going to deglaze the pan so deglaze will basically sort of rinse all that flavor off the bottom of the pan yeah okay because that's going to make the most amazing sauce now you could use tomato puree but chopped canned tomatoes you'll make a much better sauce I'm gonna top that with some stock so the secret of braising is having little of the meat exposed and 90 of it submerged see them now yeah they're like little crocodile heads popping up out the water turn the gas off and leave the lid just off at the end there if we had to cover it completely the steam hits the top yeah the lid and all that water comes running back it's solar still that's right in the oven 140 150 for about three and a half to four hours good job Boom for pudding I'm making one of my absolute favorite Italian desserts Banna cotta with that quintessentially Italian flavoring espresso start by immersing two leaves of gelatin in cold water and leave to soak into a small saucepan add caster sugar cream milk sugar and a shot of good strong coffee gently bring to a simmer and remove from the hob [Music] wheeze out the soaked gelatin leaves and stir into the hot cream until completely dissolved pour your cream mixture into a jug and fill your molds just short of the rim rinsing your molds

Ragu with Papa Deli and for pudding espresso panna cotta with cinnamon hazelnut brittle a stunning meal to bring the whole family together in the best Italian tradition a delicious saffron flatbread with mussels it doesn't get any healthier than that first job the super easy saffron flatbread put the saffron into the bowl and a couple of teaspoons of hot water that starts to infuse the saffron and so you can maximize on the color across your flatbeds to make the dough simply add plain flour a pinch of salt and pepper to a bowl and then pour in a dash of olive oil that makes the dough nice and silky and Rich you're saffron water you'll see how concentrated it is now and then you'll need cold water then simply need to bring the dough together mop up all your flour you can see now saffron's activated it's got that really nice color beautiful use your wrist and just knead it nicely we'll do now is smoothing out the gluten strands push and tuck in push and tuck in and each every time you do this getting softer you just sort of form like this perfect beautiful though it smells delicious that saffron is a powerful now sit that in your bowl cover your clean film let it rest for 10 to 15 minutes this relaxes the dough making it easier to roll and gives it time to infuse with the saffron I'm going to cut that into three and then roll them nice and thinly now lightly flour the surface and then just bring that it's like a perfect ball on the board your rolling pin and just roll it out now it doesn't get any simpler than that and then just lightly flour that on top a little salt cooking the flatbread is easy just pop in a hot dry pan and they're ready in minutes as it hits the pan it starts to blister is ready for turning beautiful get that color on there now you want it

stretch the pastry that thin and get it even it's an absolute nightmare Life's too short to make it at home when you can buy amazing phyllo pastry so when working with it always get a nice damp cloth and just lay the damp cloth over it that keeps it nice and moist and it stops the filo pastry from actually drying out put a pan on to melt your butter it's the butter that gives the crispiness to the filo pastry have you ever got a brush or coat feel a pastry with butter and make sure that butter is nicely seasoned you take your first layer layer onto the balls nice brush that with your butter and the nice thing about filo pastry is that it can be used for Savory and sweet these are going to have a fragrance Savory flavor with thyme black pepper and parmesan cheese so no need for salt lift up

herbs and cheese with glorious honey yogurt this Middle Eastern treat hits the spot and it's so simple to make gorgeous grilled lamb copters with my incredible Twist on the Middle Eastern classic hummus first job glorious beetroot hummus I'm gonna blend and puree the cooked chickpea and the beetroot now the beetroot gives that pickly delicious flavor to the hummus beetroots in with the chickpea a nice seasoning of salt and pepper a tablespoon of olive oil a tablespoon of tahini this is roasted sesame seeds pounded and mixed with oil crushed garlic and toasted cumin seeds grind then pop into a blender [Music] I love that nice dark Rich color and you finish it with a nice lemon slice it in half take out the seeds and squeeze the fresh lemon juice at the end just wakes up the acidity in the beetroot but really cuts the richness of the chickpea and the lemon juice is pivotal it really brings the beetroot and the chickpeas together chickpeas are packed with protein very dense and it needs that kind of acidity one more little blend lovely nice little taste that's delicious homemade beetroot hummus so tasty and it really is that easy to make to finish some toasted cumin seeds and sumac that is delicious it's a sort of Middle Eastern spice and then some sesame seeds finish that off with margarine almost done now for my copters panel onion nice and finely diced garlic three nice clothes squeeze the garlic over the onions onions garlic in you get a really nice color on them after that a nice teaspoon of chili flakes beautiful now into our pestle and mortar with a teaspoon of toasted cumin give that a little bit of salt in there helps grind it down that is such a lovely smell aromatic exciting spicy intriguing once ground to a fine powder sprinkle your spices into the onion and garlic to create a wonderful aromatic paste now for the lamb mints lightly season it and then add all that wonderful flavor next for some freshness parsley and mint roughly chopped and a glug of olive oil put your hands in there and give that a really good mix traditionally you can see koftas on little sticks barbecue skewers and depending Where You Are they have different sort of variations and shapes and sizes I much prefer the nice little sort of almost like little mini Burgers like little mini sliders but these can be griddled these can be fried in a pan or even cooked on the barbecue start by Rolling the mix into a golf pool size then flatten out always lightly oil your plate that way when you set them in the fridge don't need to be all again they're just going straight into the pan because they've got oil underneath and all on top keep your hands lightly oiled and it helps stop the lamb from sticking to your fingers then pop them into the fridge to set and firm up before cooking now you can cook the kofta in a frying pan on the barbecue or an amazing little griddle pan gets the plaque really nice and hot whilst that heats I'm making a yogurt dip I love a nice sort of fresh minted yogurt put fresh mint leaves salt and a pinch of toasted cumin and black pepper into a pestle and mortar to grind as you start to sort of blend the mint almost turns into a nice fresh mint puree and smell out of that it's incredible add yogurt and I like Greek best and a squeeze of lemon look at that now beautiful now the copter so they go on [Music] one of the biggest problems on cooking copper is that they move them too early and they start to break up but let them Grill and by grilling them they'll naturally lift off the bar once they're charcoaled

cooking for a special occasion you want to nail some key things one your recipes need to be bulletproof you don't want a disaster on the big day two as well as tasting phenomenal they have to be easy to serve so you can relax and enjoy yourself three when you're out to impress food needs to look great too my first recipe fits the build perfectly stuffed Lamb with spinach and pine nuts stuff meats are perfect for special occasions they look impressive taste amazing but more importantly they are so simple to do pan on for the stuffing it's a saddle of lamb basically a sort of Rolls-Royce cut perfectly shaped and it suits stuffing it's an absolute tea for the stuffing finally chop an onion garlic nice thin slices oil in onions and garlic in it's just salt and pepper make sure the stuffing is Juicy seasoned so it helps to season the inside of the Lamb now we've got the color on those onions I'm going to throw in some pine nuts and that helps to give a bit of a texture here's where it starts getting really exciting spinach in and just lay the spinach over the pine nuts it looks like a lot of spinach that's going to condense and disappear almost instantly so much more flavor as soon as when you start it as opposed to steaming it or boiling it gas off look at that now to bring that together no eggs no bread crumbs crumbled feta over the spinach feta cheese adds a beautifully salty sharp and creamy flavor what this does it brings that stuffing together now open up the lamb keep those little fillets to the side that's the channel that we want to stuff so I want to just open that up a little bit there salt and pepper lightly and before we put our stuffing in we're going to season it with Sumo sumac is a wonderful lemony spice that goes brilliantly with lamb and you can get it in most big supermarkets and it sort of cuts through that thick Rich sweetness of the Lamb open up that lamb there take a spoon if you're preparing this for the day ahead then let the stuffing cool down it's inevitable when you start rolling it and tying it something's going to squeeze out so load up the ends take these Beauties these little fillets and just support that stuffing and sort of increase that beautiful tunnel and then from there over there and bring that towards you and then roll like I said some of the stuff is going to come out now I'm going to tie it first off around the side and don't worry about some flash which is not just tight one in the middle you can get butcher's strength from your local butcher or at cookware shops I got two ties go too Thai it just forces all that stuffing out of the Lamb when it's in the oven nice now I want to season the top of it roll the joint to make sure all the skin gets seasoned now you think normally that just goes in the oven like that that's how my mum would do it but get your tray onto the gas oil in get it really nicely colored none of your stuffing's coming out of the sides really important look at that color beautiful it does kick start the roasting process gas off into the oven cook for 45 to 55 minutes depending on how pink you want your lamb lift the lamb out of the fat to rest resting it raised up in the tin will stop it cooking but not cool it down too quickly that means you won't lose any of those lovely juices next I'm making a simple but sophisticated accompaniment for the lamb top and tell the Cucumber peel it cut the Cucumber into three and just core taking out all that it's just sort of watery seedium it spoils the flavor slice the Cucumber cucumber in really nice way of making a cheap and cheerful cucumber look at the Hammers we're going to dress that cucumber with a nice fresh yoghurt a couple of tablespoons next some fresh mint dress it touch of salt Touch of pepper and then pomegranate molasses that just swings it up finish that with lemon mix that up lamb is rested carefully take off the string and then just gently pull them back straight edge knife that's going to cut through that crispy fat on the outside instantly I tied it purposely so I can guess my portion control from the lines hold it nice and firmly look at your line where the string was and look this one is going to be amazing lay and down just in those two slices there it proves that stuffing Meats is for special occasions because that is a saddle of lamb at its absolute best stuffing meats and fish not only makes them look fantastic it also gives them an extra added flavor Dimension too once you've mastered the technique you'll be able to turn out dishes that will guarantee you'll have an unforgettable Feast here are three more of my favorite easy stuff dishes that are perfect for any Feast first up chicken with garlic and Chestnut stuffing packed with flavor and earthy richness for the stuffing before I finely chopped onion garlic and celery in hot olive oil next add pine nuts which have a lovely creamy taste and chopped earthy cooked chestnuts both add a wonderfully chewy texture and richness to stuffings season and add chopped parsley [Music] then stirring cooked wild rice next take a whole deboned chicken it's fiddly to do at home but if you ask your butcher will do it for you and pile the stuffing mixture along the center now simply roll the chicken up tightly and tie it with your butcher's string then roast in a hot oven for just over an hour simply carve into magnificent thick slices so impressive so easy and trust me this is a dish guaranteed to get a fantastic reaction on any occasion holster fish will always make an impression my next recipe is the bass stuffed with fennel lemon and capers first place a whole gutted sea bass on foil and season the fish inside and out sea bass is known as the king of the Seas and has a wonderful sweet white flesh start the stuffing with sliced fennel its aniseed flavor works brilliantly with the fish next add Capers fresh dill slices of lemon then dot in knobs of butter lastly add a splash of white wine which helps to steam the fish and creates a lovely sauce and seal tightly into a parcel this locks in all the juices and flavor then simply bake in a medium oven unwrap and hear your guess ooh and R with delight prepared in 10 minutes wrap for intense flavor a stunning sea bass that's bound to create a stir [Music] my next dish throws a Spanish Twist on a classic English roast pork stuffed with Manchego and menbrillo use a pork loin roasting joint lay the joints skin side down and cut and cut three quarters of the way into the flesh creating space for the stuffing next thinly slice Spanish Manchego cheese this has a wonderful buttery nutty taste and is fantastic for stuffing as it melts brilliantly slice Spanish umbrella Queen's jelly sweet and perfumed is the perfect partner for the saltiness of the cheese then simply layer your cheese and Quince jelly into the pork add Sage leaves for a strong and deliciously bitter flavor roll the meat up and tie with butcher's string next add more Sage leaves and some aromatic fresh thyme to a roasting tin then lay the pork on top skin Side Up cut a bulb of garlic in half and wedge it under the meat the garlic wedges help lit the pour so it roast to Perfection and will add a sweet depth or flavor to your gravy drizzle with olive oil season and roast for just over an hour with the heat on high for the first 20 which helps get the skin crispy and golden [Music] once cooked leave the pork to rest as you make a stunning gravy simply Place The Roasting tin over medium Heat add a lug of Sherry and delays using the roasting juices gives

the thing will just cook naturally casserole dishes are surprisingly versatile and a great investment you only need one and if you look after it it'll last you a lifetime brilliant for one pot wonders welcome back to my ultimate cookery course I'm teaching you my slow cooked favorites my guide to getting the best value from your butchers one of the biggest bills in the kitchen is going to be for meat so it's crucial you keep costs down but that doesn't mean sacrificing flavor especially when you use some slow cooking magic to get the best from cheap cuts to get value for money it always pays to ask an expert and fifth generation award-winning Master butcher Danny lidgate is a man in the know one of the great things about going to a butcher is they're going to have more Cuts available than most supermarkets so you're going to see things that people don't know about so one example might be the beef ribs a great product for slow cooking in the oven especially cooking on the bone you're going to get more flavors from the bone there's some really nice pieces of Juicy meat these only used for mints in the past now people are using it for braising or slow braising or even barbecuing it with some really nice marinades the oxtail are less popular now than maybe they used to be small little mussels make up the tail once that's slow cooked they all fall apart really tender juicy Meats also oxtail is Sublime en stews curries and soups another great cheap cut for slow cooking is one you saw me using earlier Lamb's breast [Music] is one of the least expensive cuts of lamb and it's also delicious slow roasted or stewed here we have the shin of beef you can see in the sheds made up lots of little different mussels these are always moving always doing work so slow cooking will give the best end results it's going to have fashion a little bit but it should be enjoyed by everybody it's a fantastic piece of meat here we have some ox cheeks and when they're trimmed you end up with a really lean piece of meat obviously with the cheek the cow's always eating munching on grass this means I need a lot of cooking but essentially it's a really nice healthy lean piece of meat with fantastic flavors oxchicks also make an incredible ravioli or Ragu and if you're a pork lover why not try pork neck it's a succulent alternative for a slow Sunday roast here we have a muscle from the shoulder it's called feather blades the reason it's called feather blade is because when it's cut each piece looks like a feather the gristle tends to be slow cooked and the more it's cooked we'll turn gelatinous giving a lovely jelly and juicy liquid to the meat fantastic for casserole pies and stews there are so many cheaper cuts which are brilliant for home cooking it's important with all these forgotten cuts to find out how to cook them don't be scared of them they're really economic but full of flavor and the end result is fantastic meal as a chef one of the biggest kicks I get is taking an ingredient that doesn't cost much and turning into something that looks and tastes like a million bucks my next recipe turns what used to be a decidedly unfashionable cut of meat into the star of the dish fit to Grace any table slow roasted pork belly with fennel slow roasting works better on fattier tougher and unfashionable cuts whether it's a cheek or even a neck or this amazing pork belly it's a fantastic way to transform cheap cuts into amazing melting perfection take a very sharp knife bring the pork belly towards you so you're over it you've got all that pressure and weight using the tip of the knife I'm just sort of nicking it I go across the pork belly long strokes with a knife take your time turn it 180 this time what we're doing is just sort of cutting those nice little sort of diamonds but as that starts roasting on top it starts to get nice and crispy take your handfuls of salt and just sort of rub it in bend it over and then all those cracks really helps to get a nice crisp crackling on top roasting tray getting really nice and hot take a hole over fennel to intensify flavor and to keep the meat succulent I'm braising my pork belly with strong vibrant spices and vegetables crush and peel three whole cloves of garlic and add to the fennel olive oil in fennel in I like the nice strong aniseed flavor that goes with that nice rich dense pork fennel seeds delicious Taiwanese in and just a couple of cardamom seeds and wow they're like little bangers like little firecrackers incredible lovely fresh bay leaves get your pork skin side down just sear the top of that fat that locks in all that amazing flavor then I'm gonna flip it over and get it nice and crispy and then on fennel seeds embedded in those little cracks now some white wine the minute that white wine hits that pan you can just smell that light fragrance and the fennel allow the wine to Bubble away and reduce until the alcohol is burnt off sometimes at the stock NOW the stock goes in just underneath the skin so it roasts on top all that meat under there it's gonna be submerged because what happens in the oven the top goes crispy as anything and the stock reduces and braises at the same time really importantly bring that back up to the ball before it goes in the oven otherwise it will never boil never go up to temperature smells incredible slow roasted pork belly at 180 degrees for two and a half hours [Music] look at that you've got that nice crispy skin on top you can see how much of the stock has evaporated put that onto the board it looks stunning to make a delicious rustic sauce with the flavor packed contents of the roasting tray first get rid of the excess fat take a couple of slices of bread it's like a perfect sponge because you just lay that on top and drag it almost like a net and it just absorbs all that fat if you want the perfect fried bread trust me stick that in a frying pan a nice teaspoon of mustard whisk that in and then simply simmer for a few minutes before pouring into a serving jug with your pork belly always use a nice serrated edge knife you can hear that wow that is amazing incredibly tender that belly of pork is gonna almost melt in your mouth you've got that sweet meat under that crispy belly of pork what an amazing way to cook a very cheap cut of meat [Music] foreign [Music] kitchen tips first how to make a

importantly it's so easy to do a little bit of love and care at the beginning and it Cooks itself right step one chicken carcass into a high sided pan an onion does need to be finely chopped the vegetables flavor the stock onion in then from there cut your leek into nice big solid chunks roughly same size as the onion silver vegetables cook at the same time and then add carrots celery and garlic and then a nice sprig of thyme that helps to really give depth of flavor to the chicken stock a couple of bay leaves and some fresh parsley and then peppercorns pan and just lightly crush them and a little pinch of salt and now just cover the vegetables and the carcass with cold water just cover the chicken and the vegetables bring it up to the ball as quick as you can now as it comes into the boil a really nice skin take the base of a ladle and swirl that around that pushes all the grease and the impurities to the side of the pan then get your Laden and just tilt it if you don't skim all that off the stock becomes very cloudy people's impression of cooking stock then it needs to cook for three four hours at a time this is one chicken carcass let that boil away gently for 30 to 40 minutes maximum we're gonna pass it off let's take a sieve place that over the pan and then just pour that in it smells amazing it's aromatic the color is absolutely beautiful from there you have the most amazing stock when you need to season meat in flour a great tip is to place it in a plastic bag to dust it evenly using flour also helps the sauce to get nice and thick during cooking when Browning meat fry in small batches don't crowd the pan otherwise it won't sear or color properly when slow roasting meat line the bottom of the roasting tray with chunky vegetables like onions fennel

first up how to keep your knife Sharp it's far harder working in the kitchen with a blunt knife than it is with a sharp knife the secret behind keeping a sharp knife sharpen it before and every time you use it first grip the steel feel really comfortable about holding the still imagine you're holding a tennis racket or you're playing squash you've got to be really comfortable with it now 45 degrees confident grip confident grip with a knife this is the butt of the steel really important to keep your fingers behind there you never grip a steel with your fingers over that because the knife comes back in you've just lost a finger always grip behind nice long strokes so we get the whole of the blade over Steel stroke and we start from the bottom to the top so there cross there across slow Strokes over the top of the steel and then come back underneath then back underneath it is so dangerous working in the kitchen with a blunt knife you can cause so much damage working with a sharp knife is 10 times quicker more efficient now that's ready to start chopping stop your chopping board rocking or slipping a great tip is to Simply wet a kitchen cloth kitchen paper or tea towel and

for making long delicate parmesan shavings to top soups and salads it also makes wonderful chocolate curls your pepper mill is more versatile than you might think tighten the top screw to get finely

out the peeled cloves [Music] this is my ultimate cookery course 100 recipes to stake your life on I'll be showing you a roast chicken recipe to die for hold the drum and slice straight through but first like any good Chef I'm always looking to get great ingredients at the right price my shopping Mantra is simple first rely on your senses make sure whatever you're buying it looks smells and really feels good and if you get the chance taste it before you buy it second is to recognize that knowledge is crucial the more you know about where your ingredients come from and how they produce the better so ask lots of questions and learn you're never too old to learn from experts and when it comes to buying great birds one person knows what to look for is award-winning fifth generation Master butcher Danny lidgate poultry is a great meet because there's many different types of birds it's worth tasting the variation of flavors between different first and first is massive turkey is a great lean meat that's available all year round not just for Christmas anybody who's worried about eating fatty Meats is a really healthy flavoursome meal okay game birds people don't try them often enough once they're shots they're hung up for a little while but a few days at least it means the meat's going to be more tender it all adds in flavor to the birds we've got a wood pigeon and a red leg Partridge both really good and cook really quickly when you're buying a chicken some of the things to look out for is obviously the smell and when you're smelling a good quality chicken you can tell the difference the Skin's a nice white color and it smells like a fresh chickeny smell when you're buying from a good butcher you'll find you tend to get the giblets as well which is basically the neck and other orgas this is great for making gravy once you have cooked it you can use all the off cuts for other things stir fries curries pasta dishes save the bones use the bones for stocks and soups a really packed full of flavor and remember there are lots of different breeds of chicken all have different characteristics and flavors so shop around and find the ones you love here are three of my all-time favorites the label onglay these come from an old British breed they've got smaller breasts but the meat's delicious the black leg a fantastic French variety succulent with bags of flavor and really meaty thighs and the police this is the Rolls-Royce of chickens Rich gamey and delicious one for special occasions I think people should maybe try and buy Less meat but aim for the best quality you're only going to get out what you put in by putting the best quality into a dish you're going to get the best results no matter how season the chef you are there are always new ingredients and recipes to get fired up about so if a tidal recipe is getting you down spice it up with fresh ideas and flavors this recipe is an old classic roast chicken but with a simple twist it takes on a new life and is guaranteed to impress one of the things I love about cooking and that keeps me excited after 25 years behind the stove is that there's always something new to learn every day new ingredients new techniques and new cuisines start off with the stuffing it's amazing how exciting a stuffed roast chicken can be because it keeps the chicken incredibly moist and gives a delicious texture inside the bird I'm going to start off with cured chorizo this is a traditional Spanish sausage and it's garlicky spicy incredibly meaty that gives a little bit of sort of richness to the stuffing get a freezer in start cooking that down and getting all those oils out little touch the olive oil in there to get it going right onions chopped add the onions to the chorizo and in a matter of seconds they'll change color as they soak up all the flavor that lovely spiciness has been stolen from that sausage and now the onions smell incredible garlic garlic in fresh thyme just hold it down and put your fingers on there and it's a really nice way of taking off all those nice fragrant little time flowers you can hear it cracking in the background these are cannellini beans they're waxy very soft and so delicious but very dense but for stuffing they're so robust nothing breaks down drain them off in they're going to take on all that juice as well from this freezer I'm going to season them now because they're very dense so it needs some help and that looks like it's a dish on its own good enough to eat now I want to sweeten things up a little bit Tomatoes half dried in that sweetens up the stuffing beautiful the stuffing's ready look at the color everything Spanish it looks delicious now stuffing the chicken I like taking off these little knuckles as the chicken Cooks the skin stretches over the bone you can get a really nice drum and take off those little wing tips as well salt pepper so important now you're stuffing I want to go right inside the chicken push it down this really helps to cook the bird evenly because you're pushing out all the empty spaces in the carcass and take a nice large Lemon push the lemon in pick up the parcel's nose pull the skin over olive oil on top sauce pepper a teaspoon of paprika sprinkle it on and then get your hands and sort of rub that in and see what the paprika's doing to the chicken putting this like sweet spicy marinade it's not even roasted yet but it looks delicious [Music] 400 ml white wine same quantity of water that helps the chicken to steam Chicken in be generous with the time Sprigs make sure the fall is folded tightly around the roasting tray so the chicken steams in the oven keeping it moist and juicy into the oven [Music] cook for one hour at 180 degrees with a foil on nice take it out and remove the full lid then give it another 30 minutes to crisp up that skin look at that so important to make sure you take that tinfoil off with half an hour to go beautiful Pierce that open squeeze it in that delicious gravy mix that into the tray sieve that that's a really nice fragrant lemony spiced roasting juices to finish before we cut up the chicken take out amazing stuffing [Music] incredible I'd have that with chicken over potatoes any day and then just get your chicken roasting juices now cut the chicken up hold the drum and slice straight through and there's that wonderful drum and the thigh through the wishbone off slice with the point at an angle so you can see the texture of that amazing roast chicken take my cooking juices I just want to give a nice sort of lemony

sandwiches [Music] for me the secret of a great brunch is fun and Casual fuss-free cooking and everyone helping themselves this is the ultimate steak sandwich you want the Rolls-Royce of beef it has to be fillet now season it beautifully I like to open up the top of the pepper mill to increase the size of the pepper in the steak so it gives that bit of heat nice little chunks you just roll now nicely all the way around slice the garlic in half pan nice and hot olive oil in hold the steak and just place it into the pan don't drop it at the front of the pan we're going to till the pan forward to cook the back of a steak dual purpose now roll it back and see it underneath next my garlic and roast that garlic thyme fry that time I want to hear it we're not looking for a lot of color because you're going to dry out the fillet so just one end turn it back down and clear the other end in lift up your thyme place it on top of the garlic the lift up your fillet and sit that on top of your garlic butter in take a spoon tilt the pan gently lift up and baste I've got that scented garlic thyme flavor steak is going to cook evenly because it's sat on a little a little bit in the oven for eight to ten minutes [Music] pan on for the relish you think of a steak sandwich you think of a sort of nice heated tomato relish to make the relish finely dice a red onion three finger rule one in front two behind through and chop wow next roughly chop a chili keeping the seeds in for extra heat start off with the olive oil into a pan onions chili [Music] generous with the olive oil I want a nice sort of Rich silky relish from the biggest Tomatoes you can just use red tomatoes but these yellow and red make the perfect combination now put your salt in pepper and then roast those Tomatoes off take a wooden spoon and just sort of break them up once the Skins blister the whole tomato just starts to release all that really nice sweet texture little teaspoon of cherry vinegar gives that nice acidic balance the sweetness of the tomatoes turn down the gas and just let them sort of Stew perfectly now a steak sandwich would not be complete unless it had the most amazing mustard mayonnaise simply add three tablespoons of mayonnaise to three teaspoons of whole grain mustard [Music] now I've got the relish almost down to like a really nice jam now I want to make that relish a little bit more fragrant some basil slice it through sprinkle that basil in there [Music] beautiful look at this there she is my crown jewels time to take it out smell is incredible just based one more time fill it touches quite soft in the center so it's just coming up to mid-rare let it rest the same time you cooked it would be nice and pink evenly throughout the steak to make my sandwich I'm going to char grill some sliced Jupiter bread season it nicely just a little drizzle of olive oil I want to get that bread nice and crispy pan nice and hot bread in push it down smell is amazing that Char sort of charcoal flavor we've got those marks on the bread it's just stops the bread from becoming soggy and look at this here it is stunning on slice it gently one beautiful slice wow it's nice and pink all the way through and the beef is so soft it's almost like slicing through butter let the knife do the work take a little bit of mayonnaise spread that the back of the spoon on both sides next lettuce take that beautiful slice of beef well and then relish on top of that beef and just slice the sandwich in half beautiful now that's what I call a steak sandwich trust me so the sublime sandwich for brunch and you'll put a smile on everyone's face next up my guide to buying the best beef and steaks the ultimate brunch you can't do any better than start with a perfect steak and one man who really knows his steak is Master butcher Danny lidgate steak is my favorite type of meat and I think it's really good to enjoy different varieties of steak when choosing a steak that you want you need to look at exactly what you want out of it for my ultimate steak sandwich I used to fill it because it's the most tender the fillet does the least amount of work than all the other mussels it's tucked away in the rib cage this means that when you're buying a fillet it's incredibly soft like butter it's the most expensive but you get what you pay for there's a wide array of cuts to choose from all different in taste and texture if in doubt ask your butcher this would be the ramp section where the rump comes from which is basically the back side take the bone out and what you're left with is a wonderful steak rum steak characteristically a little bit tougher than the sirloin or a little bit chew it in the ribeye but a really strong flavor for the steak again when buying rum look for the marbling try and get some fat covering on the steak you can always cut it off after it's cooked Rams one of the best value Stakes I love it thinly cut and fresh fried in stir fries or simply marinated and whacked on the barbecue another great value but delicious gut is the hanger steak known as the butcher's cut because they often keep it for themselves it's great marinated and cooked quickly with the sirloin which is basically the back of the animal a nice sirloin like this really well marbled don't buy too lean so once the solo is trimmed up it looks something like this not too much fat but you need a little bit of cooking it next to the sirloin is the rib really popular now rib eyes small nice really tender juicy steaks it's really especially good for barbecuing or grilling fantastic probably my favorite steak would be a rib eye ribeye is especially delicious because the marbling in the meat loads it with flavor for a full-on steak experience try the T-bone steak with a small tender fillet steak on one side of the bone and a larger flavor some Sirloin on the other take your butcher's advice and you won't go wrong the final word has to go to Danny when buying meat knowledge really is power so it's important to ask as many questions about the meat you're buying find out the breeds how it's aged and decide exactly what you want to do each particular job that should then give you a really amazing end products [Music] the great thing about brunch is there are no rules the only thing I insist on are it's got to be fuss-free easy to cook and so delicious it puts you in a good mood for the rest of the day and for me pancakes always hit the spot here are three of my deliciously different recipes certified to liven up your mornings first up

little Jake off underneath that actually stops the board from sliding care for your wooden board by rubbing it with oil every so often any cooking oil will do wooden boards for me are always the best easy to clean and long lasting when you do wash your wooden board never let it stand in water or put it in the dishwasher as it may split buy the best you can afford and take good care of it [Music] for brunch I love something sweet and I've always been a fan of classic British crumpets with butter and jam but once you try cooking them at home you'll never want to buy them from shops again this is another great recipe you can stay your life on it's my homemade crumpet whether you're cooking for two three or even a gang some of the best brunch dishes are always the simplest these crumpets are absolutely delicious and it's a great end to a fantastic brunch first off we're going to make the mix what do you think of growing up the smell and the taste of amazing crumpet it never leaves you to make the mix the secret is to bring the milk up the ball but do not boil it the minute it boils turn it off and let it sit there now flowering a nice pinch of salt in now add half a teaspoon of bicarb that gives it aeration and really lifts the mixture up all those lovely little holes a nice Pinch of Sugar and then a teaspoon of yeast dry yeast now once the milk's boiled turn it off and add some warm water about 10 tablespoons 150 ml that cools down the milk but more importantly it doesn't destroy the yeast half of the milk in first stop and give that a really good mix now the rest of it [Music] [Music] you can just see that there's no lumps through there as it drips through the Whisk now we're looking for it to double in size and get nice and light so pop in a warm place whilst you get on with a delicious topping beautiful strawberries but caramelized almost like a very quick strawberry jam hang on just slice these in half some sugar a couple of tablespoons we're gonna take the sugar to a nice light camera it's just starting to change color now turn the gas down and we're going to add the strawberries beautiful just sweating the strawberries down quickly and the caramel is breaking down a wonderful glaze on the strawberries some lemon grated into the strawberries gives it that kind of freshness that really starts to break down the strawberries nice up smells incredible some lemon juice a touch of balsamo vinegar and that gives it a really nice delicious tartness now if it goes as the strawberries start to cool down it will naturally thicken and set beautifully now for the crumpet it's almost doubled in size but be very careful you don't knock the ball because it can sort of push out all that air it's aerated as nice as light just see the texture she's ready to go did you boil it here we go instead of making normal small crumpets I'm making a giant one ideal for sharing now turn the gas down you just start to see a traditional Crumpet style cooking process we want those nice tiny little holes on top and that Crispy Crunchy base right now it's time to add the butter and just slide the butter down the bag that gives it a really nice nutty flavor at the end fish slice slip beautiful take that out [Music] Jam spoon it over the secret is for the juice to sort of run inside all those little holes think of that tartness of the balsamic vinegar the strawberries beautifully soft and almost pureed rats and that delicious now finish that with a nice ball of creme fresh let that sit there and that is an amazing way of finishing off a traditional brunch with something sweet something delicious and something you're dying to tuck into [Music] next my tricks the trade and kitchen tips fruit can be a great healthy option for brunch and knowing how to get the best out of it can make all the difference first up how to peel and cut a mango the easy way holding its stalk end up cut either side of the stone cut all the way into the flesh making squares without cutting through the skin then turn it inside out and carefully cut your pieces off foreign tip to check if a pineapple is ripe is to pull a leaf out from the top if it comes away easily it's ripe and ready for slicing my tip to get the flesh out of a kiwi is to Simply cut the fruit in half and scoop out with a teaspoon try it it really works if you have fruit that's not perfectly ripe the tip is to put a banana in a paper bag then add your unripe fruit put it in a dark place and the banana will speed up the ripening process of the other fruit foreign you can make a grapefruit puree to accompany a brunch pancake or a crumpet in a blender to clean it afterwards add a cup of warm water and run the machine for a few seconds empty out and simply repeat with a drop of washing up Liquid then rinse [Music] of course bursting with valuable lessons top tips and 100 recipes to take your life on and you'll literally be cooking yourself into a better chef many of these

you know where everything is stock spatula pan Etc it becomes less stressful but more importantly the end results are incredible [Music] first off panel with and stock with this amazing fermented soybean puree into the pan three nice tablespoons gas on now get your fish stock and whisk into the puree be generous with the stock you want this nice light broth basically you can buy miso paste from Big supermarkets and it works brilliantly with salmon poaching the salmon in the Miso stuff gives it a really nice sort of sweet earthy creamy flavor it's incredible bring up to the ball I'm gonna Infuse the broth and make it a little bit more fragrant coffee or Lime Leaf is Bay lemony inside the Miso broth then chopped chili Chili's in and finely sliced Ginger that's simmering beautifully now we're going to post the salmon poaching means cooking it in liquid but it's cooked gently and the secret here is to keep that Salmon skin on if we took the skin off now the salmon can actually break up whilst it's poaching skin side down just gonna slide that in under nice the minute that stopping start boiling turn it down let it simmer take a little Ladle and just have a couple of minutes pour over that makes sure the top of the salmon is cooked evenly and keeps it nice and moist and poaching is one of the most delicate ways of cooking so you have to handle it with care whilst the salmon is poaching in the Miso broth start preparing your vegetables I'm using tender stem broccoli and Pak Choy I always like to cook the leaf and the stem separately the leaf is like sort of spinach and the stem is so much thicker it's almost as thick as a stick of celery so I like to get the stems sliced just sort of got that nice sort of Christmas place the leaves together nicely roll them up nice and tight and then slice them down now my salmon already the flavor in that broth has been elevated now it tastes really fishy got the heat chili spices the ginger and the cafe Lime Leaf take your fish slice and place it very gently underneath the salmon and push it down fish slices are flexible for that reason bend it lift it up it's touch looking for a springy firm texture just sit there on top a little touch of the broth over it stops it from drying out leave that to cool down for two minutes bring the stock back up to the boil broccoli in back Choy stems in a little taste it's getting better and better and better cook the broccoli and the bok choy stems for one minute and then add the tops in turn the salmon into your hand and just peel all that skin off the skin also helps to keep the salmon nice and moist then gently flake the salmon that's the secret behind poaching everything just stays so moist wonderful long shards of pink now just before we serve we're going to add our mushrooms these are enoki mushrooms you can buy these enoki mushrooms at Big supermarkets and good Grocers slice them off I'm going to put half in and the other half I'm going to serve with the salmon toasted sesame seed oil put a little drip in there just rub and you're just lining almost like a little coat of varnish start off with your mushrooms and then my salmon four nice layers and then finally the mushrooms top with the vegetables and then finally a nice ladle that beautiful really Sumptuous Rich stock lovely and that is an amazing misu poached salmon soup simplify your cooking by getting organized and amazing food will be coming out your kitchen every day and for great food you need great ingredients my recipe for meatballs is so versatile it can be used to make a dozen amazing dishes one of my favorites is meatballs and fragrant coconut broth having a freezer of home-cooked delicious food ready to go can be a real Lifesaver it means you never have to compromise on Flavor these meatballs are delicious but more importantly they freeze so well first off get your pan on and start sweating off your onions and your garlic this recipe involves making the meatballs the classic way but the exciting part is actually cook them in coconut milk and it gives a really nice new dimension to a sort of soft Rich Sumptuous meatball chop the onion nice and finely giving those slices very close together close to the slices the finer the onions cut it back down at an angle slice down just chop I want the onions nice and fine because I want some finesse to these meatballs The Secret of a really good meatball is the texture getting that balance right between the minced beef the breadcrumbs the milk and the seasoning a couple of cloves of garlic slice of garlic really nice and thinly nice pan nice and hot a tablespoon of olive oil quite generous with the olive oil onions and garlic in a little touch of salt and pepper with your mints open it up a little bit and sort of cut it out that's salt and pepper for me a good meatball is all about the the softness the texture of that Rich beef and the way it sort of melts in your mouth you can color it on the outside or you want it nice and soft and sort of rich in the center mix that in beautifully and then paste it back out again I've got some really nice dried chili flakes I'm going to season the onions with the chili flakes chili flakes in cook that out for two minutes I'm gonna add some milk [Music] take your breadcrumbs make a little well three four tablespoons of milk that makes a sort of nice slightly doughy texture but it lightens the texture of the meatball place that in add your onions your garlic and your chili in there as well nice put your hands in there and start mixing them if you've got the right amount of milk and breadcrumbs it doesn't mean binding with an egg don't make them too small problem with making them too small is the fact that they dry out quickly just the size of a golf ball a little bit bigger nice getting a really nice tight squeeze that stops IT from breaking up it always pays to double the recipe and spend a bit more time making extra meatballs so you can freeze a batch ready for another time give the pan a little wipe out don't wash out that pan we've got that flavor from the onions the garlic at the bottom look at that pan nice and hot Touch of olive oil in there place them the top of your pan nice and gently set them in the oil get a palette knife and go underneath them and just sort of tilt the pan and let the pan cook the back of the meatball we're going to add some heat coriander seeds slightly spicy and peppery just to give a really nice flavor to the coconut milk and next some cardamon seeds three or four onto the board knife on and no touch of turmeric into the center of the pan that's going to give it a really nice spicy flavor a little pinch cinnamon all the time you're doing this those meatballs are just getting tastier and tastier a couple of dried chilies let them Infuse in that oil and then some lemongrass just take the back of your knife and sort of Beat It Down that starts to release all that lovely sort of fragrance like someone's just let off the most amazing fragrant air freshener in for the lemongrass finally some fresh ginger peel it's nice nice and thinly time now turn them over and let the other half for a wonderful flavor to stop in bring the stock up to the boil turn the gas up and then add the coconut milk and I want the coconut milk just sitting underneath the top of a meatball coconut milk in and that sort of gives it that creamy richness but it's not heavy it's a fragrant light richness before we start simmering check the seasoning that nice soft texture of the meatball but that fragrance light richness of the coconut broth it's going to cook those meatballs perfectly bring the broth up to the boil and simmer gently for eight to ten minutes touch them with your finger they should be slightly pliable but slightly springy gas off and finish it off with something light and fresh zest of lime but I want the zest on top of the meatball sort of cut through that richness and then finally squeeze fresh lime and that just gives it that nice zesty amazing taste stirring the juice [Music] I've got that kick in that vibrant taste now the exciting part when you come to serve it be generous with that coconut broth talk the pan get a good couple of ladles of a broth in meatball [Music] and that is a very delicious way of eating a old-fashioned meatball and bringing it into the 21st century and they're just as good cooked from Frozen as well [Music]

baking tray small little knob of butter and the grease baking tray and line it some greaseproof paper and just over extend it shiny side out dull side hits the bottom of the tray in grease proof allows me to maximize on the white chocolate inside the mix my grease with paper the chocolate can melt and almost stick to the tray so the paper is just a really nice insurance policy secondly we want that rise and that sort of crispness now with the mix get your spatula all the way around I don't see anything left in that bowl position the ball over your tray nice and carefully don't leave that slice in the bowl nobody's licking that one and then just take the back of a spatula go into the corners push and come back into the middle turn the tray around let it work to your advantage try and get it evenly positioned in the tray if it goes in even it Cooks evenly make sure you smooth out the top of the Blondie with the back of the spatula and then into the oven it's going to rise it's

hand for yourself or to share raspberry milfoy desserts should always have that wow factor and this dish is incredibly simple to prepare but it tastes and looks absolutely stunning first off puff

number three means a thousand layers just lightly dust the top of the puff pastry with iced sugar we're going to start off in a hot oven at 220. for the first six or seven minutes and then 10 minutes at 190 into the oven now for the filling fresh vanilla cream in and start whisking I want the cream whisked nice and thick but look to all that nice fresh vanilla seeds in there next a nice scraping of orange zest orange liqueur don't whisk that in fold it in and that stops the cream from separating them lovely now take that out of the bowl and put it into a Piping Bag unwrap over your hands in a

ultimate cookery course I guarantee it will taste as Sensational as it looks caramelized figs with ricotta slow cooking can also take desserts to a whole new level a gentle long cook can really bring

scissors trim the edge almost we've got a bit of a sort of sharp Point bring your three figs together and just thread the top of each fig nice and gently Rosemary works wonderfully with sweet dishes

five minutes they sort of marinade I know it sounds odd to use vinegar in your dessert but trust me it gives the dish a fantastic sweet and sour taste I'm gonna make a really nice caramel four or five tablespoons of sugar now flatten that out and get it nice and even when the sugar is even caramel Cooks evenly it's changing now you can see it melting from the outside in the one thing you don't do is shake the pan rapidly and sit almost like sort of a lake defrosting and it's hitting to the center bubbling it's still not dark enough yet it's getting there turn the gas down and stay in control let the sugar melt until it turns a dark amber color the secret behind any good caramel is just stopping it from overcooking lovely take that off the gas another butter in there gently whisk in the butter is cooling the camel down you'll see it changing color to like a cafe Olay next add a lug of the balsamic vinegar beautiful for that nice dark richness of a camel a little touch of water in there that way the camel doesn't go too thick now put the camel back on the heat take a fix and sort of place them in gently lovely and then just added all that lovely little marinade don't waste that it's amazing stuff there [Music] icing sugar and butter vinegar so tasty based those figs because the skin gets nice and crispy on the outside and the Fig sort of just absorbs the caramel delicious so easy now into the oven 190 for 10 minutes [Music] almost doubled in size now look at the color on them they smell is incredible onto your plate they're a lot heavier because they've actually started absorbing that camera now dash the figs with caramel and serve with ricotta cheese the freshness of that ricotta goes brilliantly well with the figs I'm gonna finish that now it seems zest and then

cooking for a special occasion you want to nail some key things one your recipes need to be bulletproof you don't want a disaster on the big day two as well as tasting phenomenal they have to be easy to serve so you can relax and enjoy yourself three when you're out to impress food needs to look great too my first recipe fits the build perfectly stuffed Lamb with spinach and pine nuts stuff meats are perfect for special occasions they look impressive taste amazing but more importantly they are so simple to do pan on for the stuffing it's a saddle of lamb basically a sort of Rolls-Royce cut perfectly shaped and it suits stuffing it's an absolute tea for the stuffing finally chop an onion garlic nice thin slices oil in onions and garlic in it's just salt and pepper make sure the stuffing is Juicy seasoned so it helps to season the inside of the Lamb now we've got the color on those onions I'm going to throw in some pine nuts and that helps to give a bit of a texture here's where it starts getting really exciting spinach in and just lay the spinach over the pine nuts it looks like a lot of spinach that's going to condense and disappear almost instantly so much more flavor as soon as when you start it as opposed to steaming it or boiling it gas off look at that now to bring that together no eggs no bread crumbs crumbled feta over the spinach feta cheese adds a beautifully salty sharp and creamy flavor what this does it brings that stuffing together now open up the lamb keep those little fillets to the side that's the channel that we want to stuff so I want to just open that up a little bit there salt and pepper lightly and before we put our stuffing in we're going to season it with Sumo sumac is a wonderful lemony spice that goes brilliantly with lamb and you can get it in most big supermarkets and it sort of cuts through that thick Rich sweetness of the Lamb open up that lamb there take a spoon if you're preparing this for the day ahead then let the stuffing cool down it's inevitable when you start rolling it and tying it something's going to squeeze out so load up the ends take these Beauties these little fillets and just support that stuffing and sort of increase that beautiful tunnel and then from there over there and bring that towards you and then roll like I said some of the stuff is going to come out now I'm going to tie it first off around the side and don't worry about some flash which is not just tight one in the middle you can get butcher's strength from your local butcher or at cookware shops I got two ties go too Thai it just forces all that stuffing out of the Lamb when it's in the oven nice now I want to season the top of it roll the joint to make sure all the skin gets seasoned now you think normally that just goes in the oven like that that's how my mum would do it but get your tray onto the gas oil in get it really nicely colored none of your stuffing's coming out of the sides really important look at that color beautiful it does kick start the roasting process gas off into the oven cook for 45 to 55 minutes depending on how pink you want your lamb lift the lamb out of the fat to rest resting it raised up in the tin will stop it cooking but not cool it down too quickly that means you won't lose any of those lovely juices next I'm making a simple but sophisticated accompaniment for the lamb top and tell the Cucumber peel it cut the Cucumber into three and just core taking out all that it's just sort of watery seedium it spoils the flavor slice the Cucumber cucumber in really nice way of making a cheap and cheerful cucumber look at the Hammers we're going to dress that cucumber with a nice fresh yoghurt a couple of tablespoons next some fresh mint dress it touch of salt Touch of pepper and then pomegranate molasses that just swings it up finish that with lemon mix that up lamb is rested carefully take off the string and then just gently pull them back straight edge knife that's going to cut through that crispy fat on the outside instantly I tied it purposely so I can guess my portion control from the lines hold it nice and firmly look at your line where the string was and look this one is going to be amazing lay and down just in those two slices there it proves that stuffing Meats is for special occasions because that is a saddle of lamb at its absolute best stuffing meats and fish not only makes them look fantastic it also gives them an extra added flavor Dimension too once you've mastered the technique you'll be able to turn out dishes that will guarantee you'll have an unforgettable Feast here are three more of my favorite easy stuff dishes that are perfect for any Feast first up chicken with garlic and Chestnut stuffing packed with flavor and earthy richness for the stuffing before I finely chopped onion garlic and celery in hot olive oil next add pine nuts which have a lovely creamy taste and chopped earthy cooked chestnuts both add a wonderfully chewy texture and richness to stuffings season and add chopped parsley [Music] then stirring cooked wild rice next take a whole deboned chicken it's fiddly to do at home but if you ask your butcher will do it for you and pile the stuffing mixture along the center now simply roll the chicken up tightly and tie it with your butcher's string then roast in a hot oven for just over an hour simply carve into magnificent thick slices so impressive so easy and trust me this is a dish guaranteed to get a fantastic reaction on any occasion holster fish will always make an impression my next recipe is the bass stuffed with fennel lemon and capers first place a whole gutted sea bass on foil and season the fish inside and out sea bass is known as the king of the Seas and has a wonderful sweet white flesh start the stuffing with sliced fennel its aniseed flavor works brilliantly with the fish next add Capers fresh dill slices of lemon then dot in knobs of butter lastly add a splash of white wine which

delight prepared in 10 minutes wrap for intense flavor a stunning sea bass that's bound to create a stir [Music] my next dish throws a Spanish Twist on a classic English roast pork stuffed with Manchego and menbrillo use a pork loin roasting joint lay the joints skin side down and cut and cut three quarters of the way into the flesh creating space for the stuffing next thinly slice Spanish Manchego cheese this has a wonderful buttery nutty taste and is fantastic for stuffing as it melts brilliantly slice Spanish umbrella Queen's jelly sweet and perfumed is the perfect partner for the saltiness of the cheese then simply layer your cheese and Quince jelly into the pork add Sage leaves for a strong and deliciously bitter flavor roll the meat up and tie with butcher's string next add more Sage leaves and some aromatic fresh thyme to a roasting tin then lay the pork on top skin Side Up cut a bulb of garlic in half and wedge it under the meat the garlic wedges help lit the pour so it roast to Perfection and will add a sweet depth or flavor to your gravy drizzle with olive oil season and roast for just over an hour with the heat on high for the first 20 which helps get the skin

involved and dip in and dip out this is an exciting fragrant wrap that is so easy to do first off soak the noodles these are thin glass noodles basically bring the kettle up to the boil and just pour just let them steep there for a couple of minutes the noodles are for my prawn rolls as they soak I'm gonna make a spicy dipping sauce to go with them start off with sugar we're trying to create that sweet sour salty put a really nice sort of heated sauce as well rice wine vinegar that will dissolve the sugar fish sauce now that's going to give it its saltiness next the chili I want the seeds left in because I want some power chili in a little bit of garlic don't need to chop it too finely just slice it take a spring onion just top and tell them slice is bringing in nice and thinly so it's sort of almost permeates that dipping sauce I grew up with a love of spring rolls but on the back of my visit to Vietnam it sort of transform my respect for a spring roll give that a little mix a little

braised stuffed lamb breast one of the secrets to slow cooking is to be robust and really get stuck in big bold flavors work brilliantly well so don't be precious this is gutsy cooking at its absolute best these are lambres a beautiful cheap cut and they're sort of tucked alongside the rib they've been boned out the skin has been taken off I'm going to roll them stuff them and braise them braising simply means cooking in liquid on a low heat making the meat divinely tender now open them up and give them a really good seasoning season them both sides inside and out really important it doesn't

and roll that nice and tightly that's what I'm looking for a string just need to tie them three times one at each end and one in the middle I fell in love with this dish years ago when I first started

easy ballito misto a classic Italian mixed meat dish [Music] I'm starting with some Italian fennel sausages [Music] fry them until colored making sure all sides are nicely browned set them aside then slice chorizo a spicy Spanish sausage with a wonderful Smoky taste and Fries so releases all its incredible flavor [Music] next chop carrots celery garlic and add to the same pan this keeps in all the

along with chicken stock simmer until the lentils are tender then season to taste [Music] finally sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve simple to prepare a cinch to make and packed full of delicious

crumble over some creamy feta cheese preparation but slow cook for maximum flavor aubergines like you've never tasted before one more dish that uses time to transform a humble ingredient is perfect slow cooked beef foreign [Music] start by frying the beef Shin in hot oil seasoning as you go it's a very economical cut of beef as it slow Cooks it also makes the most delicious gravy as the marrow thickens and flavors the sauce [Music] the same pan saute chopped carrots peeled whole shallots sliced celery peeled and chopped ginger and garlic next add tomato puree and cook for a few minutes [Music] add the shin back into the pan with a glass of dry white wine and the juice of an orange this deglazes the pan adding incredible depth of flavor [Music] pour in chicken stock season and simmer

make slow cooked to Perfection three amazing dishes I guarantee you'll make time and time again [Music] this is my Essential guide to kitchen equipment everything you need to know about the basic kit that will get you cooking fantastic food casserole dish absolutely essential when it comes to good home cooking why so versatile the beauty of this thing is the fact that you can actually use it on the hob or start it on the hob and finish in the oven more importantly cast iron it conducts the heat so you can have the gas on absolute minimal or the oven down to its absolute lowest setting and the thing will just cook naturally casserole dishes are surprisingly versatile and a great investment you only need one and if you look after it it'll last you a lifetime brilliant for one pot wonders welcome back to my ultimate cookery course I'm teaching you my slow cooked favorites my guide to getting the best value from your butchers one of the biggest bills in the kitchen is going to be for meat so it's crucial you keep costs down but that doesn't mean sacrificing flavor especially when you use some slow cooking magic to get the best from cheap cuts to get value for money it always pays to ask an expert and fifth generation award-winning Master butcher Danny lidgate is a man in the know one of the great things about going to a butcher is they're going to have more Cuts available than most supermarkets so you're going to see things that people don't know about so one example might be the beef ribs a great product for slow cooking in the oven especially cooking on the bone you're going to get more flavors from the bone there's some really nice pieces of Juicy meat these only used for mince in the past now people are using it for braising or slow braising or even barbecuing it with some really nice marinades the oxtail are less popular now than maybe they used to be small little mussels make up the tail once that's slow cooked they all fall apart really tender juicy Meats also oxtail is Sublime en stews curries and soups another great cheap cut for slow cooking is one you saw me using earlier Lamb's breast [Music] is one of the least expensive cuts of lamb and it's also delicious slow roasted or stewed here we have the shin of beef you can see in the sheds made up lots of little different mussels these are always moving always doing work so slow cooking will give the best end results it's going to have fashion a little bit but it should be enjoyed by everybody it's a fantastic piece of meat here we have some ox cheeks and when they're trimmed you end up with a really lean piece of meat obviously with the cheek the cow's always eating munching on grass this means I need a lot of cooking but essentially it's a really nice healthy lean piece of meat with fantastic flavors oxchicks also make an incredible ravioli or Ragu and if you're a pork lover why not try pork neck it's a succulent alternative for a slow Sunday roast here we have a muscle from the shoulder it's called feather blades the reason it's called feather blade is because when it's cut each piece looks like a feather the gristle tends to be slow cooked and the more it's cooked we'll turn gelatinous giving a lovely jelly and juicy liquid to the meat fantastic for casserole pies and stews there are so many cheaper cuts which are brilliant for home cooking it's important with all these forgotten cuts to find out how to cook them don't be scared of them they're really economic but full of flavor and the end result is fantastic meal as a chef one of the biggest kicks I get is taking an ingredient that doesn't cost much and turning into something that looks and tastes like a million bucks my next recipe turns what used to be a decidedly unfashionable cut of meat into the star of the dish fit to Grace any table slow roasted pork belly with fennel slow roasting works better on fattier tougher and unfashionable cuts whether it's a cheek or even a neck or this amazing pork belly it's a fantastic way to transform cheap cuts into amazing melting perfection take a very sharp knife bring the pork belly towards you so you're over it you've got all that pressure and weight using the tip of the knife I'm just sort of nicking it I go across the pork belly long strokes with a knife take your time turn it 180 this time what we're doing is just sort of cutting those nice little sort of diamonds but as that starts roasting on top it starts to get nice and crispy take your handfuls of salt and just sort of rub it in bend it over and then all those cracks really helps to get a nice crisp crackling on top roasting tray getting really nice and hot take a hole over fennel to intensify flavor and to keep the meat succulent I'm braising my pork belly with strong vibrant spices and vegetables crush and peel three whole cloves of garlic and add to the fennel olive oil in fennel in I like the nice strong aniseed flavor that goes with that nice rich dense pork fennel seeds delicious Taiwanese in and just a couple of cardamom seeds and wow they're like little bangers like little firecrackers incredible lovely fresh bay leaves get your pork skin side down just sear the top of that fat that locks in all that amazing flavor then I'm gonna flip it over and get it nice and crispy and then on fennel seeds embedded in those little cracks now some white wine the minute that white wine hits that pan you can just smell that light fragrance and the fennel allow the wine to Bubble away and reduce until the alcohol is burnt off sometimes at the stock NOW the stock goes in just underneath the skin so it roasts on top all that meat under there it's gonna be submerged because what happens in the oven the top goes crispy as anything and the stock reduces and braises at the same time really importantly bring that back up to the ball before it goes in the oven otherwise it will never boil never go up to temperature smells incredible slow roasted pork belly at 180 degrees for two and a half hours [Music] look at that you've got that nice crispy skin on top you can see how much of the stock has evaporated put that onto the board it looks stunning to make a delicious rustic sauce with the flavor packed contents of the roasting tray first get rid of the excess fat take a couple of slices of bread it's like a perfect sponge because you just lay that on top and drag it almost like a net and it just absorbs all that fat if you want the perfect fried bread trust me stick that in a frying pan a nice teaspoon of mustard whisk that in and then simply simmer for a few minutes before pouring into a serving jug with your pork belly always use a nice serrated edge knife you can hear that wow that is amazing incredibly tender that belly of pork is gonna almost melt in your mouth you've got that sweet meat under that crispy belly of pork what an amazing way to cook a very cheap cut of meat [Music] foreign [Music] kitchen tips first how to make a fantastic chicken stock a classic slow cook recipe that gets amazing flavor from simple ingredients chicken stock ingredient to good cooking it trans sources it's a fantastic base for Soups and more importantly it's so easy to do a little bit of love and care at the beginning and it Cooks itself right step one chicken carcass into a pie sided pan an onion does need to be finely chopped the vegetables flavor the stock onion in then from there cut your leek into nice big solid chunks roughly same size as the onion silver vegetables cook at the same time and then add carrots celery and garlic and then a nice sprig of thyme that helps to really give depth of flavor to the chicken stock a couple of bay leaves and some fresh parsley and then peppercorns pan and just lightly crush them and a little pinch of salt and now just cover the vegetables and the carcass with cold water just cover the chicken and the vegetables bring it up to the ball as quick as you can now as it comes into the boil a really nice skin take the base of a ladle and swirl that around that pushes all the grease and the impurities to the side of the pan then get your Laden and just tilt it if you don't skim all that off the stock becomes very cloudy people's impression of cooking stock then it needs to cook for three four hours at a time this is one chicken carcass let that boil away gently for 30 to 40 minutes maximum we're gonna pass it off let's take a sieve place that over the pan and then just pour that in it smells amazing it's aromatic the color is absolutely beautiful from there you have the most amazing stock when you need to season meat in flour a great tip is to place it in a plastic bag to dust it evenly using flour also helps the sauce to get nice and thick during cooking when Browning meat fry in small batches don't crowd the pan otherwise it won't sear or color properly when slow roasting meat line the bottom of the roasting tray with chunky vegetables like onions fennel and carrots they act as a trivet to keep the meat from boiling in its own juices plus the veg can be the base for your gravy later on after slow cooking baked on residue can be tough to remove but if

Pre-order your copy of Ramsay in 10 here -...",2022-12-03 22:16:02.926159, adding a glazed ham to your holiday menu is a great way to get ahead it's delicious versatile and the ultimate dish to have in the fridge for any hungry guests who drop by Christmas would never be the same without a beautiful delicious honey glazed ham across that long Christmas period this can get you out of jail quite easily ham salads ham sandwiches Hamburg and chips the is a Gammon what we can do now is cook it so it becomes a ham in Japan first things first the water cover it completely so the whole Gammon Cooks evenly the important part now is adding flavor in there carrots in the leaks the more veg in there now the more fragrant the broth becomes once the ham is cooked that stock is extraordinary the base to a fantastic soup onion not finely chopped and in homemade hamstock is packed with flavor so it's great for making soups sauces stews and risottos plus it can be frozen so it's there when you need it pan down peppercorns lightly Crush then to give their Christmas flavor I'm adding crushed coriander seeds two cinnamon sticks and four aromatic bay leaves up to the boil and then turn it down let it simmer and then skim it cooking a ham isn't hard but it does take time this two kilo joint takes two and a half hours to simmer before it's glazed and baked however it is worth it because it tastes absolutely delicious so the glaze very very simple Demerara sugar Madeira that sweetens the glaze basically a 45 wine a couple of tablespoons in and then show vinegar again couple of tablespoons honey in nice bring that up to the ball the longer you leave it on the stove the darker it becomes you want your hand really nice and dark then cook out the glaze for three four minutes that I'm happy with lovely right the gammon's cooked now onto the plate carefully snip the string nice and gently peel back get rid of the skin then crisscross it don't push too deep let the knife do the work stud it close [Music] look at it almost looks like an albino pineapple the glaze and just carefully cover start in the middle and let it work round oh God gently gently gently gently it's not even roasted yet and it looks amazing beautiful look at that half the glaze over now into the oven 15 minutes I started to color look at the rest of the glaze and pour that over look at it wow the more effort passion and love you show the ham now the results are tenfold look at it every five minutes out of the oven and glaze again I'm back in the oven now a 190 degrees we're going to baste and roast for 35 minutes delicious next I'm going to make a pear and saffron Chutney this is a fruity relish that works brilliantly with a sweet aromatic ham First Things First Slice the onion [Music] fry the chopped onion in olive oil without coloring it the important part about this stage is the fact that we're going to layer the chutney with textures from onion to Apple to pear a nice little block of Ginger grating the ginger so the ginger sort of disappears with the onions then add the spices a good grating of nutmeg followed by a teaspoon of cinnamon and a teaspoon of cayenne pepper to give it a kick delicious I recently spent a lot of time in India where chutneys originated and discovered that whereas the British style chutneys tend to be cooked and are usually quite sweet Indian ones are normally fresh spicier and quite sour next Demerara sugar once that Sugar's dissolved the white wine vinegar all in that's going to give you this really nice sort of sweet and sour flavor from there our fruit these are Williams pairs per is the star of the Chutney so keep it quite rustic next add chopped cooking apples their tanus gives a lovely contrast to the sweetness of the pears to give it great texture a handful of sultanas paint your saffron this gives it a really nice depth a rich golden color saffron is the world's most expensive spice it's made from the dried stigmas of the saffron crocus flower and as a general rule of thumb the deeper the color of the threads the better the quality and to make it lighter the zest and juice of two oranges the orange and the saffron go brilliantly well together just squeeze that in there This chutney's brilliant with ham fantastic in sellers but equally as delicious with fish whether it's a roasted Cod a grilled fillet of mackerel it goes brilliantly well bring it up to the ball cook that out for 15 minutes now Tomatoes going at the end and that brings a certain amount of freshness to Chutney really helps to give it that nice texture [Music] mix that in literally cooking cooking in 30 seconds [Music] what's great about this Chutney is that as it matures its flavor gets better and better and it will keep for up to six months fill up the jar and that is going to deliver amazing flavor across Christmas and look my goodness me that is Fit For A King foreign [Music] listen I need some help okay we're gonna make the most amazing

French pumpkin but these versatile vegetables come in all shapes and sizes and colors at this time of year their nutty sweetness is ideal for warming soups curries and roasts wait and see what happens when we open this up wow oh right Holly that's for you now this is where it's going to get a little bit gory okay you get your hands and you scrape the seeds out but this is getting messy rub them together and just give them a little clean nice and gently good yeah nice look at that what do you mean yuck come on Holly that's it into the water now once the seeds are out we're going to toast them

roast and absorb flavor season and had a generous amount of Rosemary take the garlic rub around the outside so perfumes the inside then add a large glug of olive oil and as a garlic roast with a rosemary it's sweet almost buttery nutty taste or mellow and flavor the pumpkin all the seeds done yeah almost good after the pumpkin seeds have been cleaned dry and season them ready for the oven and

#GordonRamsay #Cooking #Thanksgiving...",2022-12-03 22:16:02.926159, my caramelized cranberry apple sauce is another recipe I always cook a day in advance it packs a wonderful punch that really lifts the subtle flavor of the turkey it's simple to make and with its deep red vibrant color looks fantastic on the plate the secret behind any good Christmas is in the organization and the preparation anything can get done in advance do it apple and cranberry sauce is a prime example first things first we're gonna make a really nice caramel sugar in at 150 grams of caster sugar to a pan followed by a couple of star anise that helps to really give a nice sort of aniseed flavor to The Cranberries next lightly crushed four cardamom pods this has a lovely warm Spicy Sweet flavor then wait for the sugar to melt and form a caramel really important to have the confidence now to color that caramel so it gets really nice and dark before putting the Cranberries in [Music] [Applause] [Music] wow smell of that caramel is amazing now cranberries in crumb is a very tart and acidic but balanced with the sweetness of the caramel and apples they give the sauce a lovely dry sharp note to tell if they're fresh drop them on a hard surface the higher they bounce the fresher they are the secret now is for the caramel to blister the cranberries and really start to break that down smells fantastic next core peel and thinly sliced two apples and once the sauce is finished it really just helps to sort of wake up flavor of the turkey Now The Cranberries are starting to break down Apple in smells fantastic salt and pepper really important really helps to balance that tartness against the acidity of the Apple salt and pepper really brings it back the smell is fantastic it's a sort of sweet sour spicy nice now from there delays the pan with a touch of port around the side deglazing dissolves all the lovely sticky caramelized bits of food that are stuck to the pan and incorporates them into the sauce next add the zest of an orange [Music] and for another layer of fragrance sweetness squeezing the juice lovely then cook on a low heat for five to ten minutes to thicken but remember the salt will become even thicker once it's cooled down now that is the right texture I don't want a runny sauce I want something really nice and thick delicious packed full of flavor perfect if you really want to get ahead this sauce can be made three or four days in advance and kept in the fridge which allows the flavors to develop even more smoked salmon scrambled egg and croissant it's Rich some just an incredibly easy to do first the croissants slice them into rounds and season them lightly with salt and pepper the secret behind a really good breakfast is in the timing on the quesles on first smoke salmon on top and then the scrambled egg put the croissants in a dry pan and toast you don't need oil because the castles have a lot of butter in them this is a great way to transform day old croissants giving them a delicious new life and just start to see them toasted almost listening in the pan and that's the butter inside that smell is amazing it almost smells like a sort of caramelized waffle absolutely delicious toast them all around both sides and then out next just get the smoked salmon and sort of twist it and let it fall over the castle let it sit naturally on top of the toasted croissant scrambled eggs eggs into the pan never whip up the eggs beforehand you break down the egg too much what I want is a really nice rich creamy scrambled egg eggs in no seasoning at this stage a nice generous knob of butter now from there onto the Heat and all we're going to do now is Stir and stir and stir foreign texture to the eggs it looks rich delicious Sumptuous luxurious to be very careful making scrambled egg all of a sudden it looks runny and within 30 seconds it's cooked working it all the time right after stirring I plastic scraper in there take the pan off the heat and just work around the pan cleaning up all that scrambled egg that's sticking to the bottom and now look we're getting that really nice sort of creamy beautiful texture a little touch of butter in there now I'm going to start with the seasoning 30 seconds from the end salt pepper back on to the stove and a tablespoon of cream the cream actually stops the scrambled egg from overcooking cream in and then fold that in there now keep that off the heat but look at it look at that color peaceful and then finally some fresh chives there's a Ramsey classic smoked salmon toasted croissant and a delicious scrambled egg [Music] we're gonna make an amazing butter and this is sort of the start of the the most important part keeping that bird incredibly moist soft butter a touch of salt and pepper [Music] it'll touch up olive oil in there that stops the butter from burning next add the zest of two lemons and their juice this gives the flavor butter a wonderful Citrus thing [Music] three cloves of garlic turkey is a very delicate dainty meat and that's why I want the garlic pureed so it sort of disintegrates and flavors a turkey gently without becoming too overpowering then add a generous handful of chopped parsley wow that smells incredibly light give that a good mix turkey's a very very very lean bird and it dries out so so important to make sure that we help it to cook perfectly butter done now prepare the turkey we'll season the bird inside the cavity [Music] salt and pepper next half two onions and pop them in as they roast they steam inside the bird giving it a lovely sweetness put in the lemon and a couple of bay leaves for their Bittersweet spicy flavor we're sort of lining the inside of the turkey with these fantastic sort of flavors you can see the bird is upright and it's looking sort of like it's standing to attention now it's time to add the flavored butter just very very carefully open up the skin go through over the back of the breast and keep the skin intact the idea is to gently loosen the skin with your fingers so the butter can be stuffed underneath it now once you've loosened all the skin off the top of the thighs turn the bird around and just go through here again hand up and just release a little bit but don't completely break it because I don't want all that butter to run out right from there now take your butter put it into a ball smells amazing lemony citrusy and just sort of flatten it stick that in there underneath one side now once you've got it in there pull back the skin and just use that to sort of slide all the way down what we want to do now is line the top of the breast with all that butter there that butter is going to keep the turkey breast really seriously moist turn the bird around and finish covering the breasts with the butter turkey's originally came from North America and their best young and plump my favorite breed for Christmas is either Norfolk black or Norfolk bronze both of which have a wonderful gamey taste take the rest of the butter and carefully massage over the breasts legs and wings can do all this the night before and simply cover the turkey with tinfoil and keep it in the fridge ready to be cooked on Christmas Day into the tray [Music] and it will touch of olive oil now olive oil on top again that protects it gets that skin really nice and crispy and it stops the butter from burning now in the oven at 220 for 10 minutes get really nice and brown quickly in she goes beautiful [Music] [Applause] [Music] that smells fantastic after 10 minutes take the turkey out of the oven and baste then cover the breasts with smoked streaky bacon what I want to do is add a little bit more flavor I'm already starting to think about my gravy so the bacon protects it stops it from drying out but it's going to start to really give my gravy a wonderful base turn down the oven to 180 degrees this five kilogram bird will feed eight people comfortably it needs roasting for two and a half hours or half an hour per kilo basting every so often back in and now she's on the way look at that beautiful as pretty as the Christmas tree that smells fantastic wow look at that beautiful that is 90 of your work done there to test the turkey is cooked stick a knife into the bottom of the thigh and if the juices run clear it's done the secret now is to let the turkey rest uncovered for two and a half hours as the meat relaxes it reabsorbs its juices making it succulent and tender plus it'll be easier to carve it might seem like a long time to let it rest but remember the turkey doesn't need to be piping hot because I'm serving it with hot gravy that looks like a million dollars let that rest because the flavor will be 10 times more exciting once it's rested the key to pulling all the different elements of your Christmas dinner together on the plate is the gravy my recipe for turkey gravy made with cider and walnuts has a wonderful Appley nutty flavor which beautifully complements the turkey meat and fruity pork stuffing as that turkey is resting I want to make the most amazing gravy and when I say amazing I really do mean amazing drain the excess fat from The Roasting tray and put it back on the heat then remove the bacon from the top of the turkey and the roasted onions from the cavity look at them my God they smell amazing finally take out the roasted lemon first of all cut up the bacon lovely bacon into the tray there are crispy that is that's the start of our gravy the onion look at it beautiful it doesn't get any better than that chop that up onion and bacon in that smells incredible when I first got the chance to cook Christmas lunch for the chefs in Paris they taught me one crucial thing I was only 21 at the time but they made me rest the turkey as long as I cooked it so I cooked it for three hours and I rested it for three hours what a difference incredible next chop up the roasted lemon and add to the tray put in a couple of sprigs of rosemary to give it a lovely aromatic punch and Fry then add three chopped tomatoes which helps to thicken the gravy and give it a lovely fresh taste it's time to really get the turkey flavor into the gravy snap off the wing take off all your little trimmings some of these little bits here add that into your gravy these are the bits we never use everyone throws them away off there that little baby there take him off I want that bang flavor delicious try that off the smell is incredible next pour in the dry cider this adds a lovely subtle Apple flavor that really lifts the taste of the turkey meat as The Cider starts to reduce pour in the delicious resting juices from the roasted turkey wow there you go the most amazing flavor foreign has reduced by half crush the vegetables and the turkey pieces with a Masher to extract the maximum amount of flavor and basically what's happening now is that we're giving the gravy a little bit of body pour in the chicken stock and reduce again then now a little taste [Music] wow let me just close your eyes and wow it oozes flavor and turkey now sieve it back of the ladle to push it through the sieve extracting every last drop of flavor pop in a sprig of rosemary and leave to infuse ready for the finishing touch simply add crushed walnuts to the bottom of the gravy boat and ladle in the hot gravy

sugar in this cheesecake is a New York cheesecake because it's baked so there's no base start creaming the cheese and the sugar spending the amount of time I do in the states if there's one thing they know how to do out there is the most amazing impressive cheesecake Rich delicious but so simple work the bowl lift the ball to your advantage really whisk whisk whisk whisk lovely creamy now get your eggs add the extra mixture bit by bit doing it this way it's more efficient hey you're incorporating a lot of Air B the mixture doesn't separate Blaster of your egg of course you can use electric mixer but if I go to the gym we can just make a cheesecake a day cheesecake a day keep the Bingo Wings away now a couple tablespoons of flour give it a whisk stop something going Lumpy now I want to scent that cheesecake I've got the freshness zest the lemon in there I want to sort of tart it up even more fold in some fresh raspberries sort of just mix them through be careful to crush them then grease a cake tin with butter this will ensure your cheesecake slides out beautifully get your mix let that fall in now take your cake tin and just tap it mixture hits the bottom of the cake tin The Raspberries rise and you've got raspberries at the top the middle and the bottom it also stops all those little pockets of air trapping underneath the mixture and the cake tin there's no holes in the cheesecake now into the oven 180 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes [Music] hmm slightly soufflaid up pull off [Music] that's the color I wanted on top and look at it it's one of the simplest yet the most stylish cheesecakes anywhere beautiful [Music] to keep old dishes fresh and exciting it's great to get spicy my next recipe is a time-honored British classic but with addition of spices it's given a new lease of Life fragrant spice rice pudding I love cooking with spices but you don't have to just cook Savory dishes using aromatics and spices across desserts takes your puddings to a completely different level [Music] first off as spices this is a fresh vanilla pot fragrant and packed full of flavor use the back of the knife and flatten it that removes all those little seeds off the skin of the vanilla pod take your knife slice down the middle and then when you open that up the smell is incredible take the tip of the knife and you scrape inside and look all those seeds dying to come out that is incredible there are thousands of seeds still ingrained to the Pod so put them in to the casserole cardamom powerful spicy say two little pods place your knife on top and lightly crack them cracking the cardamom pods helps release all the amazing flavor cloves because of that kind of aniseed flavor with a lot of depth one two three cinnamon stick snap and in just smelling that level of fragrance you can imagine what the rice pudding is going to taste of turn on the heat lightly toast those spices just a couple of seconds and what's going to happen is just going to sort of enhance those spices in a way that it just draws out an even more powerful fragrance coconut milk in sugar two tablespoons milk and then a couple of tablespoons of cream bring it slowly to the boil to allow the flavors to infuse and this rice pudding reminds me of my time in India where I got really into that chai tea fragrance because it was just so delicious and so comforting take a lime in the lime just cuts through the richness of the coconut gives it that nice little bit of acidity goes fantastically well with the cinnamon and that fresh vanilla nice have a taste now let's come up to the boil give it a nice little clean around the outside and in with the rice use 200 grams of pudding rice don't wash it beforehand because the starch helps thicken the rice pudding in the oven and just turn that down to a light simmer and the pudding rice starts to open up and it absorbs all that coconut vanilla cardamom clove and cinnamon bring up to the ball gently and cook it out three to five minutes boiling it rapidly the rice opens up and it goes into mush so we want to keep that nice texture of that sort of fragrant rice pudding on a gentle simmer next a little luxury I'm going to show you how I take this simple delicious aromatic rice pudding to a completely different level here's what I do take two egg yolks separate them now give that a really nice whisk two nice tablespoons of mascarpone cheese whisk that into the egg yolks so it's nice and smooth it's almost like finishing the rice pudding in a delicious custard turn off the gas add that into the rice pudding what happens it starts to enrich and really thicken this rice pudding and takes it to a completely different level the rice is still not cooked started to go nice and soft you can just see how it's opening up but look it's like Rich aromatic lava bubbling away finally great more citrus zest the lime on top roasted caramelized lime zest on top of a rice pudding is phenomenal then put it in the oven for 15 minutes at 200 degrees to finish cooking the rice and develop the intensely aromatic flavors look at that an incredibly fragrant rice pudding how beautiful does that look spices are a brilliant way of helping classic dishes come alive I'll guarantee you'll never ever have had a rice pudding like this before next recipe is a proper British classic that's super simple to cook and costs next to nothing a delicious apple crumble crumbles are the perfect way to use fruit when it's in season there's lots of it about it's nice and cheap but most importantly the fruits at its absolute best foreign make a really nice light caramel pan on nice and low great two apples [Music] and this helps to almost sort of pure the Apple so much quicker there's a lot of flavor in the skin so don't worry about peeling the fruit whether it's pears plums peaches flavors in the skin [Music] start the camera a couple of tablespoons of sugar the sugar helps to get rid of the tartness in the Apple a touch Cinema that starts to make it a little spicy open up your vanilla just scrape out all those seeds now this just makes it light and fragrant all those seeds in to the Sugar We're making caramel be patient and always swirl the dish instead of stirring it when the sugar goes Brown add the Apple starts to sort of cool down the caramel but it gives it a really nice sort of caramelized puree apples almost disintegrating smells incredible turn the gas down slice up two apples it's a crumble That's Got No Frills straight forward no faffing around no peeling on the skin I want them to sort of stand out from the camera apples in now those nice thick chunks of Apple sort of almost bedding itself into the puree dried cranberries gives it that nice sort of shock in the texture sweet and chewy I want it to sort of taste zesty spicy so sit the lemon zest on top of your apples and cranberry fresh lemon juice over and that just gives that extra acidic kick takes the Cranberries the apples the caramel and the cinnamon to another level turn the gas off that says let's concentrate on the crumble flowering a couple of tablespoons of Demerara sugar sugar helps to get the topping nice and crispy butter in give that a nice little rub what we're looking for is like a breadcrumb mixture lightly season it with a touch of cinnamon and the dinner sugar sort of helps to get a nice fine crumble mix and it stops the butter from sort of melting in that flour so that's the basic crumble mix but I'm not finished yet muesli two-thirds crumble one-third muesli mix that in if you haven't got muesli then crunchy granola works brilliantly too lovely now start off in the center work your way around I want the crispiness on the top the puree on the bottom of the caramel and then the texture in the center

locking every last ounce of flavor in that pan and this spicy sausage rice does exactly that [Music] take these spicy sausages and Pierce that skin because I want all that delicious spicy sausage meat out of this casing and you get more flavor from the sausage when you take them out the casing sausage is ready turn on the gas Red Onion less acidic than a big white Spanish onion and a lot more flavoursome tablespoon of olive oil a tablespoon only because I want all that fat coming out the sausages to sort of really help flavor the onions onions in and the onions go in first because you can never Rush cooking an onion it's really important to sort of give them five to six minutes in the pan so you can really start the caramelizing I'm out of my pepper slice around wasting nothing I want to see that sort of little core those tips in the center no fine dice pepper the rice is going to be cooking for 20 minutes so I want the veg to sort of have texture after it's cooked peppers in a bit of garlic two nice cloves just slap down off of the shell the garlic in now we'll turn up the gas get the pan nice and hot because the minute that sausage goes in everything cools down and you'll end up boiling the peppers and the onions and the garlic so heat up to maximum and then just make a well in the center and then now start stirring quickly this is where you get so much more bang for your buck out of sausages because the Skin's off and the real flavor of that spicy Italian sausage is gonna come through what's great about this recipe is that you can use any type of sausage to get the flavor and the heat you want I've gone for the spicy Italian but it's just as good with mergys or chorizo a teaspoon Paprika in give it that really nice Smoky flavor rice in and we're going to sort of basically sear the rice we call it in the kitchen blasting the rice where we sort of saute the rice for 30 seconds and it takes on all that flavor next white wine so the wine sort of deglazes the pan and washes all that flavor from the bottom of the pan into the rice stock in bring it up to the boil turn it down and let it simmer double stop to Rice turn that gas down and let it simmer so 12 to 15 minutes just give it the occasional stir keep an eye on it now get ready to finish it sliced spring onions diced sweet juicy tomatoes and roughly chop earthy flat leaf parsley spring onions in tomatoes in off with the gas really important otherwise everything becomes overcooked flat leaf parsley in but look at the volume in that pan now that is an amazing way to take spicy Italian sausages to a completely different level beautiful amazing recipes don't necessarily have to include meat cooking vegetarian dishes will reduce your food bills without compromising on taste and flavor here are three more recipes to satisfy even the keenest carnivore like me that will max out on veg and won't break the bank starting with spicy black beans with feta and avocado [Music] first in a pan heat

heat oil and a little butter spoon in the potato leek and cheese mix cook gently until golden and crisp underneath then slide onto a plate flip over and return to the pan to finish cooking [Music] finally for the perfect topping fry two eggs and place them on top of the rusty top with fresh tarragon [Music] leaking Greer rosti with fried eggs are simple but substantial dish that makes the most of hearty root veg addition takes as much time to write on a Blackboard as it does to cook chickpea cumin and spinach koftas with tahini dressing [Music] in a blender put tin chickpeas cumin seeds paprika and turmeric and Blitz to a paste [Music] next roll spinach in olive oil and chop finely then add to the chickpea mixture sprinkling gram flour made from finely ground chickpeas then shade

for me the secret of a good frittata is in the sausage nice hot pan onions in getting this on the onions Heat nice and high season fennel seeds forgive the onions a really nice flavor everyone's used to cooking sausages whole but it's a really nice way of using them to take them out of their thin skin what we're going to do is crumple all that wonderful spicy fennel sausage into the onions it's going to release all that flavor a lot quicker pretty important to keep that gas nice and high and the longer you caramelize the sausage the more flavor you're gonna gain six whole eggs give your eggs a really good mix flat leaf parsley a staple in Italian cooking chop it quite rough some Parmesan it gives a really nice seasoning fresh pepper a little touch of salt and then get it in there run your fork through it so when you slice it no one's complaining they've got less sausage I'm gonna make it even more Italian by topping it with some Buffalo mozzarella dry it and then slice it nice and thinly twist it mozzarella in and then finally finish it with that pounds and cheese get the top just as tasty as it is the bottom frittata needs three and a half to four minutes under a red Hot Grill to achieve the best results always ensure your oven or grill are preheated to the perfect temperature this is the thing I love about Italian cooking it's about sharing but always focusing on the ingredients look at that I mean it's incredible a little shake the pan to make sure it comes out and then spatula underneath and just leave it it's light fluffy and it smells incredible and that for me is a dream come true it's amazing how far you can take six eggs and two sausages wow spicy fennel sausage frittata My ultimate Italian breakfast it's a cracking start to the day it's about haddock one of my favorite fish delicious highly sustainable it's packed with protein lightly smoked there's not a Dye smoke there's a big difference so you haven't got that bright yellow tinge so much better next baby spinach the spinach that's very young full of zinc great flavor a little teaspoon volleyball knob of butter that little touch of oil stops the butter from burning it looks like a lot of spinach but it's going to disintegrate almost by two-thirds I'm cooking spinach and butter open up the top of my pepper Mills so the pepper becomes almost like so Cracked Pepper not so fine once your spinach has reduced down by two-thirds add in your cubes of smoked haddock tag them it's got that nice vinegary flavor quite tart pick off the little buds from the stalks keep hold of these and grateful when you're making a tag of vinegar red wine vinegar tag and stalks in chop the tarragon into your creme fraiche little season now grain mustard goes brilliantly well with haddock incredible this mustardy Herby creme fresh will work equally well partnered with grilled chicken the haddock's starting to flake because it's smoked lightly cured it Cooks so quickly you creme fresh now it's almost like the beginning of the perfect fish pie but as opposed to putting pastry on top the eggs are going to bake on top so you've got this wonderful egg crust turn the gas off now crack your eggs around the outside it's a little twist of pepper get the remainder of your creme fresh and put a little dollop in between that adds richness to the egg whites into the oven at 180 for 10 to 12 minutes [Music] whilst the haddock and eggs baked together I can knock up a simple spring onion garnish professional kitchen chefs refuse to use the top of the spring onions but I love that nice dark green flavor it's less harsh than the white the smell of baked mustard you can't beat [Music] that is beautiful spinach was almost melted in with a had it now just sprinkle your spring onions that gives that really nice sharpness wow My ultimate hearty breakfast smoked haddock and spinach baked eggs so packed with protein and iron you'll be raring to dive into the day ahead [Music] absolutely love it why I grew up with it there's something very Scottish about porridge it's that kind of sort of great start to the day my father used to say porridge needs salt and salt only it separates the men from the boys didn't really like it it was insisted salt puts hairs on you I used to sneak a couple of sugar lumps from cafes and put them in my porridge without him watching these days my porridge has much more flavor than just salt it's packed with fruit nuts and spices add vanilla seeds to porridge oats or oatmeal really important just to rub the vanilla through the oatmeal makes it nice and fragrant now a little teaspoon of cinnamon makes it spicier and then nutmeg [Music] already that smells incredible I quite like making this up week at a time and Jack absolutely loves it now whole almonds now if you don't like that kind of crunch running through the porridge you can chop these up or blend them to a powder but I quite like the sort of texture hazelnuts incredibly good a really nice crunch keep your vanilla pot in there as well that just gives it even more lift and of course once it's baked just pull it out instead of sugar I'm adding sweetness with fruit fresh pears and raisins cranberries are great as well chopped apricots as well dried apricots in there dried mango I love dried fruit next pour in a pint of milk and mix this can be done the night before left in the fridge and then a couple of minutes before you go to bake it add your cream into your dish it looks quite liquid but by the time it bakes has this really nice rich crust on top and then just a nice little nutmeg on top now bake at 180 for 30 to 35 minutes then take the porridge out sprinkle on Demerara sugar and Grill to create a sweet Golden Crust a sort of glaze on top beautiful literally for three to four minutes look at that that makes me feel proud to be Scottish because it's perfect for a big Comfort family breakfast it's Rich it's Sumptuous and it's just a humble oatmeal phenomenal especially in the winter my spiced baked porridge with all those nuts and fruit it's a bowl full of love to start the day [Music] foreign

Pre-order your copy of Ramsay in 10 here -...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, packed with cooking tips information and 100 recipes to stay your life on take it easy because it's time for my ultimate slow cooking [Music] slow cooking is one of the best weapons in the chess Arsenal not only is it easy it's also an incredible way to transform meat into mouth-waterly melting dishes mastering the art of slow cooking is something every cook should learn first up my phenomenal slow cooked beef short ribs slow cooking is a brilliant way of getting lots of extra depth and intensity into your dishes the secret is to lock in all those flavors at the start and let the ingredients do their thing as it Cooks these are beef short ribs and there's basically five to six bones across there and as the short rib Cooks it sticks to that bone the bone implants flavor and the meat just sort of melts Cooks slowly gives it that nice level intensity slice alongside the bone stray down and see that marbling that sort of disappears and disintegrates I'm cooking them in a roasting tray get it on the heat until nice and hot seasoned beef short ribs beautifully olive oil in both of the top we'll start coloring that in [Music] it's really important to give the big short ribs a really nice Sear if you didn't Brown the meat off it goes in the oven and it looks like boiled meat so you really want that nice dark Rich coloring just cut the garlic in half slide that down the side that's going to give that beef an amazing flavor [Music] to give body to the source stir in a heap teaspoon of tomato puree I'm just hitting the bottom of the pan without tomato puree and we call it cooking out that smell the puree otherwise it just goes in there raw and it gives this sort of tartness to the braised short ribs red wine in don't use an expensive bottle of red wine there's no need bring the wine up to the boil and reduce it this Burns off the alcohol and concentrates the flavor it makes a big difference when you reduce the red wine down by half because it gives that nice dark Rich intensity look at my garlic that is just gonna sweeten everything up incredible stock in beef stock perfect chicken stock fine just to about an inch underneath the beef short ribs bring it up to the ball packing all that flavor as the beef ribs slow cook cover them so they braise from the bottom and steam from the top into the oven two and a half hours 170 to 180 degrees and she goes the great thing about slow cooking is you do most of the work in advance and then put your feet up five or ten minutes before the beef short ribs come out of the oven start your garnish this is light cured pancetta I want nice thick lardons nice big thick sticks of crispy bacon these are delicious Chestnut mushrooms I'm not going to slice them just going to cut them in half look at the color on those loud ones now all the white raw fat have disappeared the larvans have shrunk right down and all we've got there now is the proper bacon mushrooms in beautifully so the mushrooms get seasoned from the bacon I'm pan frying these separately to the beef so they're main crisp another different texture [Music] leave that to cool down now this is like Christmas day for me when you unwrap that fall wait to see what's underneath it [Music] hmm wow smell incredible lift place on your tray beautiful to make a fantastic Rich deep sauce press the soft roasted garlic through a sieve into the cooking juices we're all that nice pureed garlic coming through there because that is going to make the most amazing flavor scrape all that off the sieve nice then just start saving all that lovely braising liquor whoa in that smells delicious take your sauce and just glaze do them individually they deserve that respect spoon on your bacon and your mushrooms beautiful be generous with these mushrooms I'm telling you they taste amazing flat leaf parsley on that freshness over those amazing ribs incredible never ever be embarrassed about going to your Butcher and asking for cheap Cuts because the results are incredible amazing beef braised short ribs with bacon and mushrooms mushrooms are one of my all-time favorite ingredients I use Chestnut mushrooms with the beef short ribs because all of their firm texture and nutty taste but there's a huge range of other mushrooms that are great for slow cooked dishes and when it comes to buying them there's one expert green grocer who's a Fountain of Knowledge Burma Marcus Fred Foster started off on the dead store in primary coat really you had a salad stalk with over 20 years of experience you could actually write his own mushroom encyclopedia mushrooms as soon as you pick them the moisture starts coming out of them so you need to buy them when they're fresh certain products you smell for flavor and they tend to be fruits mushrooms don't smell nice at all they smell kind of metallic really so you have to use your eyes as you guide of what you buy with mushrooms really really important wild mushrooms are literally grown wild in the forests they're just quality wherever they are this is morel mushroom a fantastic products so hard to find in the world it's almost got an apricot type of flavor earthy Woody and of course as you cook it the flavor increases for extra flavor and texture highly prized morels are ideal when added to slow cooked stews and casseroles as are the trumpet de lemur which have a deliciously rich flavor another wild type to try is the chanterelle its subtle fruity flavor is delicious and perfect fried with butter parsley and garlic when you're dealing with wild mushrooms you need to clean them it can be quite a slow process it's with a soft brush don't don't use water never use water with mushrooms it deteriorates the mushroom rapidly oyster mushrooms are very meaty mushroom just a lovely silky smooth flavor really nice how do you tell whether it's fresh those gills are bright never cut a noise the mushroom always tear it look at the whiteness of that beautiful that would be great if it was old although also found wild oyster mushrooms are more commonly cultivated along with similar type the Enoki their delicate taste is grain salads and soups finally Fred saved the best until last and of course the Pinnacle is the Truffle they are really really short after the smell is so intense that smell it's it's hard to describe because it's such a unique smell the more expensive the Truffle the more intense the smell so that's why you use such a small amount on a dish it's amazing the way they get these they used to use pigs of course they don't do that anymore they use Dog Steel because the pig juice to eat them all this magical tasting fungi is by weight one of the most expensive Foods in the world it's phenomenal eating raw shaved over pasta or risottos or drizzle of truffle all Turns Slow cooked stews into something out of this world people are actually scared of mushrooms aren't they so it's amazing really they shouldn't be because take away the fear and just close your eyes and taste them they're just amazing they're they are amazing [Music] cooking all the ingredients in one dish helps to lock in taste and get great flavors working together here are three recipes that turn simple ingredients into amazing dishes first up a fantastically aromatic melt-in-the-mouth treat pork neck curry with mango salsa [Music] for the curry paste add chopped lemongrass chili fresh ginger garlic and Cafe Lime Leaf to a pestle and mortar next put in aromatic ground cinnamon and coriander pinch of salt black pepper [Music] and Bash it into a rough paste finally add olive oil to loosen and your paste is done now onto the pork leg add a lug of olive oil to a hot pan and brown the diced meat carefully making sure each side hits the heat locking in that flavor remove and in the same pan cook sliced onions until Brown around the edges at the curry paste and Fry to release all the intense flavors then put the pork back in along with the coconut milk and stir next add chicken stock palm sugar more kaffir lime leaves soy sauce and fish sauce to taste then simply simmer for an hour [Music] slow cooked for succulents spicy super easy to make and wonderful served with fresh mango salsa pork neck Curry foreign recipe is incredible spicy Szechuan chicken thighs [Music] first marinade the thighs with soy sauce and shouting wine which is made from fermented rice and tastes similar to dry sherry chicken thighs do a lot of work so they need more cooking but cook properly they're moist and they're the tastiest part of the bird next add rice vinegar water then season and leave to marinade for up to two hours then chop garlic chili and Ginger add olive oil to a hot pan and fry it will softened add Szechuan peppercorns and orange zest next add the marinated chicken thighs along with a marinade and throw in a pinch of sugar and Fry the chicken into as lovely and brown and the sauce is deliciously thick [Music] finish with chopped spring onions add lug of soy sauce and a few drops of sesame seed oil marinated for flavor sweet and spicy chicken a fuss-free Wonder [Music] my final slow cooked dish that transforms simple ingredients into Unforgettable food is simple beef brisket [Music] start by seizing the meat well brisket is a cut of beef from the breast it's inexpensive but it's fit for raw tea with long slow cooking place it into hot casserole dish with a little olive oil and brown on all sides [Music] next make a tasty broth to flavor the meat into the dish add chopped carrots celery a whole bulb of garlic cut in half peppercorns aromatic cloves and freshly ground nutmeg pour in hot water to braise the brisket bring to the boil and cover tightly then transfer the dish to a low oven and cook for three to four hours cook low and slow the results are amazing tender melt-in-the-mouth meat fantastic with roast potatoes or in sandwiches with lots of mustard but I like it best with Tangy Piccadilly in the oven in under 10 minutes then all you have to do is sit back and wait so easy and absolutely delicious what's not to love about my succulent beef brisket this is my ultimate cookery course 100 recipes to stay your life on soon I'll be teaching you a wonderful slow cooked dessert and look at the color on them these smell incredible but first five more of my 100 tips to make your home cooking easier [Applause] foreign starting with how to cook duck breasts perfectly the slow way duck breasts never be scared about cooking this bird absolutely delicious very healthy first oven on 200 degrees and then salt pepper now the salt will help to extract the water out of the fat nonstick pan no oil but start the duck breasts in the pan cold skin side down it feels and sounds a little bit weird but if we put them into a cold pan and turn the heat up gradually it starts to release the fat if we put them into a hot pan it seals them in and the fat stays in there we want to render that fat down 90 of that duck breast will be cooked on its skin keeps the duck nice and moist but more importantly it stays crispy once the fat comes out turn the duck over nice high hot heat seal the duck now they're going in the oven skin side down 200 six to eight minutes if your Pan's got a plastic handle it then transfer the duck breast onto a tray but make sure you put the tray into the oven to get hot first cooking duck is like cooking a piece of beef and you can't slice it piping hot all the goodness Runs Out just quickly turn it over push your fingers in there and it's slightly resistant but still quite bouncy and that confirms they're quite pink in the center but the important part now is leaving that to rest let them cool down and then we'll slice them keep that excess duck fats and there you go next time you start taking potatoes you just take them to a completely different level now slicing the duck just slice it at an angle not too thin if you're slightly thinner it goes cold quickly so nice thick slices nice crispy skin on top and a beautiful Clump roasted dark all the white fat gone nice crispy skin and absolutely delicious another slow cooking tip is when slow cooking stews and casseroles fat will rise to the surface to get rid of any excess oils my tip is to remove them with kitchen paper before serving this also works brilliantly on gravies and sauces many great slow cook dishes start by Browning the meat as the meat Cooks lots of flavors get stuck to the pan to get it into your sauce deglaze with wine stock or vinegar never add soft herbs at the beginning of slow cooking they're all too delicate the tip is to add them at the end for that Hill fresh flavor and vibrant color a great tip when frying fish is to always fry skin side down to keep it crispy and always lay the Footers away from you when adding to the pan to prevent hot oil from splashing towards you [Music] foreign cooking isn't exclusive to just Savory dishes it's a clever way to transform fruit into wonderful desserts giving them an amazing sticky Jammy intensity invest a bit of patience and my next recipe pays off big time Indulgence and bursting with flavor caramelized figs with ricotta slow cooking can also take desserts to a whole new level a gentle long cook can really bring out that wonderful Rich sticky sweetness and that depth of flavor in fruits these are black figs they are suited to slow cooking roasting better than the green figs because this outside skin is so durable this is an amazing way of roasting figs and it's so easy yet so delicious lay your figs out in a rows take some Rosemary and just peel that down look at that really nice fragrant stem get your scissors trim the edge almost we've got a bit of a sort of sharp Point bring your three figs together just thread the top of each fig nice and gently Rosemary works wonderfully with sweet dishes as the figs roast in the oven the stock will impart a lovely subtle flavor useful dust the figs with icing sugar then coat them with a generous splash of Blossom with vinegar leave them to sit there for five minutes they sort of marinate I know it sounds odd to use vinegar in your dessert but trust me it gives the dish a fantastic sweet and sour taste I'm going to make a really nice caramel four or five tablespoons of sugar now flatten that out and get it nice and even when the sugar is even caramel Cooks evenly it's changing now you can see it melting from the outside in the one thing you don't do is shake the pan rapidly and sit almost like sort of a lake defrosting and it's hitting to the center it's bubbling it's still not dark enough yet it's getting there turn the gas down and stay in control let the sugar melt until it turns a dark amber color the secret behind any good caramel is just stopping it from overcooking lovely take that off the gas not with butter in there gently whisk in the butter is cooling the camel down you'll see it changing color to like a cafe Olay next add a lug of the balsamic vinegar beautiful for that nice dark richness of a camel a little touch of water in there that way the camel doesn't go too thick now put the camel back on the heat take a fix and sort of place them in gently lovely and then just added all that lovely little marinade don't waste that it's amazing stuff there [Music] icing sugar and Balsam and vinegar so tasty based those figs because the skin gets nice and crispy on the outside and the Fig sort of just absorbs the camel delicious so easy now into the oven 190 for 10 minutes [Music] almost doubled in size now look at the color on them they smell is incredible onto your plate they're a lot heavier because they've actually started absorbing that camera now that's the figs with caramel and serve with ricotta cheese the freshness of that ricotta goes brilliantly well with the figs I'm gonna finish that now it seems zest and then some little nibbed hormones and the rich creamy Jam texture of the Fig with a ricotta brilliant that is an amazing way of slow roasting fruit and taking figs to a completely new level [Music] cookery

required and it's the oven that does all the work my first recipe is packed with strong confident flavors and with the oven taking the strain is a pleasure to make [Music] delicious slow braised stuffed lamb breast one of the secrets to slow cooking is to be robust and really get stuck in big bold flavors work brilliantly well so don't be precious this is gutsy cooking at its absolute best these are lamb breasts are beautiful cheap cuts and they're sort of tucked alongside the rib they've been boned out the skin has been taken off I'm going to roll them stuff them and braise them braising simply means cooking in liquid on a low heat making the meat divinely tender now open them up and give them a really good seasoning season them both sides inside and out really important it doesn't look like a real weighty dense cup of meat but once it's beautifully slow braised it's just like melting lamb it's incredible I'm going to season the breasts with some dried oregano put a heat in there some chili flakes [Music] lemon zest [Applause] amazing salted anchorries in there now they almost melt inside the lamb so the balance of flavors work beautifully now pull it down towards you and roll that nice and tightly that's what I'm looking for a string just need to tie them three times one at each end and one in the middle I fell in love with this dish years ago when I first started working in Paris because we had all the lamb in from the Pyrenees nice thing is they can be done the day before pan on olive oil in look at that oil nice and hot lemon it's really important to get it's a nice color on there whilst they're Browning slice The Onion the Lamb's gonna be cooking for two and a half hours so don't slice the onions too thinly otherwise it'll burn garlic and leave whole got a color on them look at that beautiful take them out onions in and garlic straight in lovely that's the secret about slow braising you never change pans why of all the goodness isn't that one pan a few chili seeds in there argano nice pinch a little bit of lemon in there and I'll do the onions what I did to the lamb [Music] next my capers fry them off get them exploding to the bottom of the pan they get nice and crispy next my black olives now white wine bring that up to the boil deglazing the pan as well a rinse in the bottom of that pan and now the flavor in there it's just extraordinary now where are our tomatoes puncher those plum tomatoes [Music] then simply place the lamb breasts back in the pot and remember to taste [Music] that's nice lid on into the oven 170. two two and a half hours and forget about it whoa beautiful all that was reduced down to this amazing nice tomato sauce and the lamb it's kept its color look at that that's braised beautifully very carefully little bits there it's nice off pull off the little bits of string this is why I get really excited the secret is not to slice it too thinly look at that smell the lemon it's hard to believe when you slice through the center there but that is a very cheap cut of meat on salivating I love this I mean it's just incredible pick up the tomatoes and the olives and the onions and amazing Rich sauce take your lamb sort of just hit it on it looks incredible that for me is why chefs get so excited with cheap Cuts because the end results are incredible delicious breast of lamb with lemon anchovies chili and oregano [Music] slow cooking is a fantastic way to develop delicious deep flavors here are three of my easy one pot wonders minimum preparation long cook and an amazing wonderful taste first up easy ballito misto a classic Italian mixed meat dish [Music] I'm starting with some Italian fennel sausages [Music] fry them until colored making sure all sides are nicely browned set them aside then slice chorizo a spicy Spanish sausage with a wonderful Smoky taste and Fries so releases all its incredible flavor [Music] next chop carrots celery garlic and add to the same pan this keeps in all the flavor stirring the pre-lentals these are excellent for slow cooked dishes because they retain their firm texture and shape next add a bay leaf and some fresh thyme sprigs then the sausages go back in along with chicken stock simmer until the lentils are tender then seasoned to taste [Music] finally sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve simple to prepare a cinch to make and packed full of delicious hearty flavors my Twist on an Italian classic magnificent easy ballito misto [Music] foreign dish is slow cooked aubergine dice the aubergine and fry in hot olive oil until colors on all sides then add a finely sliced onion and chopped garlic cook until tender cooked butter beans and pomegranate molasses which is a sweet thick and glossy Tangy reduction of pomegranate juice season [Music] next add a can of chopped tomatoes bring to a simmer and cook until the aubergine has a gloriously soft and silky texture stir through top mint pile onto toasted bread and finally for a lovely salty Tang crumble over some creamy feta cheese preparation but slow cook for maximum flavor aubergines like you've never tasted before one more dish that uses time to transform a humble ingredient is perfect slow cooked beef foreign [Music] the beef Shin in hot oil seasoning as you go it's a very economical cut of beef as it slow Cooks it also makes the most delicious gravy as the marrow thickens and flavors the sauce [Music] the same pan saute chopped carrots peeled whole shallots sliced celery peeled and chopped ginger and garlic next add tomato puree and cook for a few minutes [Music] add the shin back into the pan with a glass of dry white wine and the juice of an orange this deglazes the pan adding incredible depth of flavor pour in chicken stock season and simmer for an hour and 20 minutes brilliant finish with gremolata a dry Italian salsa made with chopped herbs simply chop parsley and garlic together and mix in the zest of an orange or lemon when the beef is cooked Rich anxious and beautifully tender scatter over the lovely fresh gremolata simple satisfying and crammed full of wonderful taste and textures delicious fast to prepare cheap and easy to make slow cooked to Perfection three amazing dishes I guarantee you'll make time and time again [Music] this is my Essential guide to kitchen equipment everything you need to know about the basic kit that will get you cooking fantastic food casserole dish absolutely essential when it comes to good home cooking why so versatile the beauty of this thing is the fact that you can actually use it on the hob or start it on the hob and finish it in the oven more importantly cast iron it conducts the heat so you can have the gas on absolute minimal or the oven down to its absolute lowest setting and the thing will just cook naturally casserole dishes are surprisingly versatile and a great investment you only need one and if you look after it it'll last you a lifetime brilliant for one pot wonders welcome back to my ultimate cookery course I'm teaching you my slow cooked favorites next up my guide to getting the best value from your butchers one of the biggest bills in the kitchen is going to be for meat so it's crucial you keep costs down but that doesn't mean sacrificing flavor especially when you use some slow cooking magic to get the best from cheap cuts to get value for money it always pays to ask an expert and fifth generation award-winning Master butcher Danny lidgate is a man in the know one of the great things about going to a butcher is they're going to have more Cuts available than most supermarkets so you're going to see things that people don't know about so one example might be the beef ribs a great product for slow cooking the oven basically cooking on the bone you're going to get more flavors from the bone there's some really nice pieces of Juicy meat it's only used for mince in the past now people are using it for braising or slow braising or even barbecuing it with some really nice marinades the oxtail are less popular now than maybe they used to be small little mussels make up the tail once that's slow cooked they all fall apart really tender juicy Meats also oxtail is Sublime en stews curries and soups another great cheap cut for slow cooking is one you saw me using earlier Lamb's breast [Music] is one of the least expensive cuts of lamb and it's also delicious slow roasted or stewed here we have the shin of beef you can see in the sheds made up of lots of little different mussels these are always moving always doing work so slow cooking will give the best end results it's going to have fashion a little bit but it should be enjoyed by everybody it's a fantastic piece of meat here we have some ox cheeks and when they're trimmed you end up with a really lean piece of meat obviously with the cheek the cow's always eating munching on grass this means I need a lot of cooking but essentially it's a really nice healthy lean piece of meat with fantastic flavors oxchicks also make an incredible ravioli or Ragu and if you're a pork lover why not try pork neck it's a succulent alternative for a slow Sunday roast here we have a muscle from the shoulder it's called feather blades the reason it's called feather blade is because when it's cut each piece looks like a feather the gristle tends to be slow cooked and the more it's cooked we'll turn gelatinous giving a lovely jelly and juicy liquid to the meat fantastic for casserole pies and stews there are so many cheaper cuts which are brilliant for home cooking it's important with all these forgotten cuts to find out how to cook them don't be scared of them they're really economic but full of flavor and the end result is fantastic meal as a chef one of the biggest kicks I get is taking an ingredient that doesn't cost much and turning into something that looks and tastes like a million bucks my next recipe turns what used to be a decidedly unfashionable cut of meat into the star of the dish fit to Grace any table slow roasted pork belly with fennel slow roasting works better on fattier tougher and unfashionable cuts whether it's a cheek or even a neck or this amazing pork belly it's a fantastic way to transform cheap cuts into amazing melting perfection take a very sharp knife bring the pork belly towards you so you're over it you've got all that pressure and weight using the tip of the knife I'm just sort of nicking it and go across the pork belly long strokes with a knife take your time turn it 180 this time what we're doing is just sort of cutting those nice little sort of diamonds but as that starts roasting on top it starts getting nice and crispy take your handfuls of salt and just sort of rub it in bend it over and then all those cracks really helps to get a nice crisp crackling on top roasting tray getting really nice and hot take a hole over fennel to intensify flavor and to keep the meat succulent I'm braising my pork belly with strong vibrant spices and vegetables crush and peel three whole cloves of garlic and add to the fennel olive oil in fennel in I like the nice strong aniseed flavor that goes with that nice rich dense pork fennel seeds delicious star anise in and just a couple of cardamom seeds and wow they're like little bangers like little firecrackers incredible lovely fresh bay leaves get your pork skin side down just sear the top of that fat that locks in all that amazing flavor then I'm gonna flip it over and get it nice and crispy and then on fennel seeds embedded in those little cracks now some white wine the minute that white wine hits that pan you can just smell that light fragrance and the fennel allow the wine to Bubble away and reduce until the alcohol is burnt off time to have the stock NOW the stock goes in just underneath the skin so it roasts on top all that meat under there will be submerged because what happens in the oven the top goes crispy as anything and the stock reduces and braises at the same time really importantly bring that back up to the ball before it goes in the oven otherwise it will never boil never go up to temperature smells incredible slow roasted pork belly at 180 degrees for two and a half hours [Music] look at that you've got that nice crispy skin on top you can see how much of the stock has evaporated put that onto the board it looks stunning to make a delicious rustic sauce with the flavor packed contents of the roasting tray first get rid of the excess fat take a couple of slices of bread it's like a perfect sponge because you just lay that on top and drag it almost like a net and it just absorbs all that fat if you want the perfect fried bread trust me stick that in a frying pan a nice teaspoon of mustard whisk that in and then simply simmer for a few minutes before pouring into a serving jug with your pork belly always use a nice serrated edge knife you can hear that oh that is amazing incredibly tender that belly of pork is gonna almost melt in your mouth you've got that sweet meat under that crispy belly of pork what an amazing way to cook a very cheap cut of meat [Music] foreign [Music] kitchen tips first how to make a fantastic chicken stock a classic slow cook recipe that gets amazing flavor from simple ingredients chicken stock ingredient to good cooking it trans forms sources it's a fantastic base for Soups and more importantly it's so easy to do a little bit of love and care at the beginning and it Cooks itself right step one chicken carcass into a pie sided pan an onion does need to be finely chopped the vegetables flavor the stock onion in then from there cut your leek into nice big solid chunks roughly same size as the onion silver vegetables cook at the same time and then add carrots celery and garlic and then a nice sprig of thyme that helps to really give depth of flavor to the chicken stock a couple of Baileys and some fresh parsley and then peppercorns pan and just lightly crush them and a little pinch of salt and now just cover the vegetables and the carcass with cold water just cover the chicken and the vegetables bring it up to the ball as quick as you can now as it comes to the boil a really nice skin take the base of a ladle and swirl that around that pushes all the grease and the impurities to the side of the pan then get your Ladle and just tilt it if you don't skim all that off the stock becomes very cloudy people's impression of cooking stock then it needs to cook for three four hours at a time this is one chicken carcass let that boil away gently for 30 to 40 minutes maximum we're gonna pass it off let's take a sieve place that over the pan and then just pour that in it smells amazing it's aromatic color it's absolutely beautiful and there you have the most amazing stock when you need to season meat in flour a great tip is to place it in a plastic bag to dust it evenly using flour also helps the sauce to get nice and thick during cooking we're Browning meat fry in small batches don't crowd the pan otherwise it won't sear or color properly when slow roasting meat line the bottom of the roasting tray with chunky vegetables like onions fennel and carrots they act as a trivet to keep the meat from boiling in its own juices plus the veg can be the base for your gravy later on after slow cooking baked on residue can be tough to remove but if you boil water in the pan it will dissolve and break down then simply pour out and wash with soap and water [Music] Follow My ultimate cookery course crammed with key lessons top tips and 100

the pan with all that fat on I'll add flavor salt and pepper a couple tablespoons of olive oil in pan nice and hot hold of the steak and lay it in always lay away to the panel a little shake and it stops the steak from sticking we're looking for color and if it sticks it's going to burn while the steaks are cooking I can go with my super quick marinade now two tablespoons of me soup paste that's a fermented soybean that gives a really nice sort of Rich sweetness tablespoon of sugar a couple tablespoons rice wine that gives it a really nice fengary kick a couple tablespoons of olive oil salt and pepper I'm looking for a nice sort of thick Rich marinade marinade done it's time to turn the steaks it's all the pan into the other space still based all we're doing every time is just adding

you'll ever need Welcome to My ultimate cookery course packed with cooking tips information and 100 recipes to take your life on right this is my guide to cooking with spice adding big gutsy flavors using spices at the beginning of cooking and then simply letting the dish slow cook is a brilliant way of getting maximum flavor with minimum effort my first recipe melts in the mouth and because the oven does most of the work it's a cinch to make slow cooked fiery lamb cooking's all about being bold and adventurous and this dish is exciting because it's slowly cooked and the longer it Cooks the more flavor something it becomes the marinating the lamb first chillers we're going to use a mixture of red and green take off the tops and just slice in garlic crushed don't worry about chopping these ultra fine just get it in there cooking for up to three hours everything sort of Blends and almost sort of pures itself together smoked paprika goes brilliantly well with the chilies two teaspoons in a touch of dried oregano some little cumin seeds the blend and the fragrance that they give out is extraordinary they release a little oil as well and helps to tenderize the lamb touch of salt pepper cinnamon that sort of sweetens up the lamb olive oil just a tablespoon and the olive oil helps to sort of stick all those wonderful spices to the lamb Chomp in just start really rubbing at this stage you can leave the lamb to marinate for anything from half an hour to overnight allowing with spices to really penetrate the meat giving amazing results when you tuck in delicious vegetables carrots and onions and that's it sliced cigarette slicing vegetables for braising is not getting too thin you slice the onions too thin they burn you've got that horrible Char taste on that slow braised braising it's just a chef's term that means cooking in liquid on a low heat making the meat incredibly moist and beautifully tender so the secret of braising is having a really nice thick durable pan get that nice and hot Touch of olive oil lemon hold the bone because you're in control then into the pan you want that white fat to start rendering so it'll add more fat therefore making it a lot more flavoursome as it braises chillers cinnamon in mix that up and don't be scared you're not burning this you're sort of searing the lamb shanks and this is the important part right at the very beginning we're going to color on the lamb which washes off as it braises in the oven so be generous with that color vegetables in wow and then a couple of Baileys so now you lift the lamb up and get the lamb sat on top of the vegetables now delays the pan with red wine the glazing means that you're you're cleaning the bottom of the pan and you're getting that amazing flavor washed off and lifted up into that sauce it can really transform that dish always delays then bring it to the boil and cook for about 10 minutes to reduce the wines reduce down by half now for the stock bring that stock back up to the ball and then into the oven now don't cover it when you cover it all the condensation comes off the lid your lamb becomes gray all this effort and that exciting spice gets washed away no lid and in the oven for three hours I slow cook on a low heat of 160 degrees gives the spices time to work and transform the meat so it's mouth-wateringly tender now look at those out on to a plate you can just see that meat sliding down juicy and creamy tender grab it by the the shank rolling around that rich delicious sauce look at that and get your sauce isn't that beautiful just get some mint don't chop it just pick that fresh mint and let it snow and there you go a very spicy delicious melting in the mouth lamb shank amazing foreign to get the most out of your spices there's only one piece of kit that you need pestle and water I mean they look fantastic and it's essential for any good kitchen these things are so versatile these ancient kitchen tools are perfect for everything from pestos to dressings and cost them around 15 quid used to grind spices and you'll max out on Flavor get perfect textures and always be totally in control make sure you've got a nice

corn [Music] it's ready to serve [Music] wonderfully satisfying curried spiced sweet corn soup that packs an amazingly aromatic punch three more stunning recipes that make cooking with spice simple incredible [Music] this is my guide to cooking with spice next up my shopping guide to buying spices [Music] when I buy my spice I only want the best and it always pays to get expert advice Burger has been selling every spice Under the Sun in London's not a hill for over 20 years so she really knows what she's talking about I love spices to smell the texture color spices are so versatile something very very simple can be really transformed into something really delicious with thousands of aromatic ingredients on a shelf if it smells good she sells it if you're buying spices buy them whole then you can try roast them grind them when you need them and then they will release the essential oils whole spices you can keep for years give them a good bushing wine bottle with your rolling pin or whatever and you see there is still Aroma and you can taste it you smell it then it's fine there's four main spouses one is sweet one is sour one is bitter and one is hot this is cinnamon and that is really a great example of a sweet spice when you buy cinnamon quill like this you have to check that you have loads of different layers in here then you can either grind this or you'd break a piece off I mean this doesn't smell of anything now but if you roll it in your hand just quickly like this and then you smell it again this is just unbelievable if you have spaghetti bolognese put a pinch of cinnamon in it to bring out the flavor this is one of those really special spices sour like a lemon but it has a salty aftertaste I use this anywhere for marinades to salad you haven't lived unless you tried it a great example for a bitter spice would actually be a turmeric this is actually a root it grows in the ground like ginger use it very very sparingly about that much well actually color you a curry or a rice dish wonderful yellow watch your fingers you get really yellow fingers from it and then we come to the hot spices one spice that I couldn't miss and that is Hungarian paprika paprika is the powdery form of a bell pepper what makes the Hungarian paprika different is that they actually grow it on Vineyards it's sort of between the vines it has a sweetness and it has a sharpness to it I have it in ice cream I have it on fish I have it everywhere Burgers spot on about the power of spices to transform dishes where there's Savory or sweet here's my quick guide to the spices I use most spice I couldn't do without always buy a hole and grind yourself so you get the freshest flavor cardamom these pods come in green or black types and have a fantastic Spicy Sweet Taste brilliant for everything from curries to rice dishes and puddings coriander these citrusy seeds are perfect whole in pickles or grind to use in fragrant stews and soups cumin a Savory Spice that's pungent and nutty it's great in marinade for delicious Meat and Fish then cinnamon sweetly fragrant and great with apples or in cakes and Nutmeg warm and spicy it's delicious and a vegetable sauce finely saffron these sweet strands Infuse a brilliant bright red color and are great in risottos and even though it's more expensive than gold a pinch goes a long long way store your spices properly and they'll last for years you keep it airtight in a tin or in a glass jar in your cupboard don't be scared of spices like an aftershave or a perfume you have to select it yourself it has to fit in with your taste and with your kitchen supermarkets and good local shops sell an amazing array of different spices so there's no excuse for not being adventurous be bold find what you like and spice up your cooking like all chefs I love the challenge of transforming classic recipes giving them a new twist to make them modern and vibrant to keep old dishes fresh and exciting it's great to get spicy my next recipe is a time-honored British classic but with addition of spices it gives a new lease of Life fragrant spice rice pudding I love cooking with spices but you don't have to just cook Savory dishes using aromatics and spices across desserts takes your puddings to a completely different level [Music] first off our spices this is a fresh vanilla pod fragrant and packed full of flavor use the back of the knife and flatten it that removes all those little seeds off the skin of the vanilla pod take your knife slice down the middle and then when you open that up the smell is incredible take the tip of the knife and you scrape inside and look at all those seeds dying to come out that is incredible there are thousands of seeds still ingrained to the Pod so put them in to the casserole cardamom powerful spicy take two little pods place your knife on top lightly crack them cracking the cardamom pods helps release all the amazing flavor cloves because of that kind of aniseed flavor with a lot of depth one two three cinnamon stick snap and in just smelling that level of fragrance you can imagine what the rice pudding is in the taste of turn on the heat lightly toast those spices just a couple of seconds and what's going to happen is just going to sort of enhance those spices in a way that it just draws out an even more powerful fragrance coconut milk in sugar two tablespoons milk and then a couple of tablespoons of cream bring it slowly to the boil to allow the flavors to infuse and this rice pudding reminds me of my time in India where I got really into that chai tea fragrance because it was just so delicious and so comforting take a lime in the lime just cuts through the richness of the coconut gives it that nice little bit of acidity goes fantastically well with the cinnamon and that fresh vanilla nice have a taste now let's come up to the boil give it a nice little clean around the outside and then with the rice use 200 grams of pudding rice don't wash it beforehand because the starch helps thicken the rice pudding in the oven and just turn that down to a light simmer and the pudding rice starts to open up and it absorbs all that coconut vanilla cardamom clove and cinnamon bring up to the ball gently and cook it out for three to five minutes bullying it rapidly the rice opens up and it goes into mush I want to keep that nice texture of that sort of fragrant rice pudding on a gentle simmer next a little luxury I'm going to show you how I take this simple delicious aromatic rice pudding to a completely different level here's what I do take two egg yolks separate them and give that a really nice whisk two nice tablespoons of mascarpone cheese we started into the egg yolks so it's nice and smooth it's almost like finishing the rice pudding in a delicious custard turn off the gas add that into the rice pudding what happens it starts to enrich and really thicken this rice pudding and takes it to a completely different level the rice is still not cooked started to go nice and soft you can just see how it's opening up but looks like Rich aromatic lava bubbling away finally Great Mall Citrus zest the lime on top roasted caramelized lime zest on top of a rice pudding is phenomenal then put it in the oven for 15 minutes at 200 degrees to finish cooking the rice and develop the intensely aromatic flavors look at that an incredibly fragrant rice pudding how beautiful does that look spices are a brilliant way of helping classic dishes come alive I'll guarantee you'll never ever have had a rice pudding like this before next my tricks of the trays and kitchen tips first how to zester Lemon the important part is not to zest any of the pith watch the following technique and I'll show you how we've got these original graters really important when we use this which is the fine zester not the big rough one not the one for slicing and not the other one for grating this little one here onto a plate because it's always easier to lift off on the plate than it is the board and the most important thing about zesting a lemon is nice long strokes but twisting the lemon round every time we go down we twist same with the orange and same with the lime tap if you go too far let me just show you look we've got that white bitter pith that destroys the wonderful zesty flavor and look that's what we're looking for there this really nice vibrant lemon zest delicious garlic is a key ingredient in so many spicy dishes my tip for finely chopping and mincing is add a pinch of salt for abrasion which helps break the fibers of the garlic down for a much better result for getting the most out of root Ginger simply remove the skin using a teaspoon it's easier than using a knife and you can get around the tricky bits or just keep the skin on and give it a good wash never throw out vanilla pods there's a ton of flavor left in the skin stick inside jars of sugar and leave to infuse great to sprinkle on cakes biscuits or porridge when grinding up spices if you have any left over you can store in an airtight jar for up to two months great for a spicy kick to have at your fingertips foreign My

chilies great crumbled into dishes for adding heat on demand chilies are surprisingly versatile if you love them in Savory dishes my tip is to try adding them to melted chocolate ganache for chocolate

little bit of lemon squeeze a little bit of lemon juice and that instantly gets rid of the heat fresh lemon juice spice up your drinks for a Mexican twist add a dash of hot chili sauce to beer or using cocktails to give your drink a very different sort of Kick this is my ultimate cookery course 100 recipes to stay your life on I'll be showing you an amazing spicy beef salad take a little teaspoon of your dressing and just go over the beef but first the secret to cooking fantastic food is to start with great ingredients the more you know personally about where your ingredients are from and how they produce the better so don't be scared ask lots of questions and learn and when it comes to chilies there's no one better to ask than chili grower Joanna Plum who's been farming chillies from mild to mind blown for over 11 years I eat chilies all the time every single day she grows over 60 Types on her farm and really knows her poblanos from a habaneros people think that chilies are all about heat actually it's about Flavor as well some are sweet some are aromatic and they can be used in so many different dishes when you go shopping and you're looking for a chili what should you be looking for what you want to do is look at the chili and it needs to be nice and firm and glossy generally the bigger the chili the milder it's going to be the smaller the chili the hotter and if it's small and wrinkly like this one it's going to blow your socks off another way to tell if a chili is hot or not is to split it open and smell it if it's a super hot chili it'll clear your sinuses the heat of a chili comes from an oil called capsaicin and that is concentrated mainly at the top of the chili where the seeds are now when you're cooking with a chili and you want the flavor of the chili but not too much of the heat start with just using the bottom of it as you get closer to the seeds that chili is going to get hotter so if you remove the seeds that also does remove some of the heat there's thousands of varieties out there because they cross pollinate very very easily and that's why the world's hottest chili is always changing Joanna's right with over 200 types available all with different flavors Aromas and of course levels of heat it's important to buy what you like here are my top chilies whatever your desired kick at the mild end poblano these are great for stuffing have a delicate flavor and often used in Mexican dishes starting to get hot the jalapeno when they're green they're like spicy bell pepper the redder they are the sweeter they are bird's eye where they really start to pack a punch long thin and pungent they're great in Thai Dishes and are often green or red and at the top end the habanero these Lantern shaped demons have a delicious fruity taste and they're the firecracker of the chili World another way to use chilies is to smoke them and to make chipotle what it is it's just a Mesquite smoked red jalapeno it smells fantastic you can almost get that like Smoky bacon sort of flavor out of it so you would use this and anything that you would slow cook so you're eating a chili and it's really too hot for you the best way to get rid of that heat is to drink some milk or a dairy product like yogurt whatever you do don't go for water or for beer don't be frightened of trying new types of chilies in your cooking experimenting with these amazing fiery beasts is a great excuse for getting hot-headed in the kitchen they give you a natural high much like when you've been exercising so your endorphins are released and you just feel good chilies make you happy and they're also an aphrodisiac South East Asian Chefs they're brilliant are balancing the hot spices of chili with sweet sour and salty flavors if you want a new Twist on a favorite dish spice it up with chili my next recipe is super simple to make but have wonderful depth and complexity of flavors spicy beef salad chillies if you use them confidently they can really add a new dimension to the style of cooking but the real trick is finding that balance of flavors that really suits you because that's the most important part so this is the most amazing sirloin you can see it's got that wonderful marble for me the secret behind this is cooking it quickly season the steaks generously salt and pepper push that seasoning in to the sirloin take the sirloin out of the fridge literally 20 minutes before you want to cook them so it gets up to room temperature they cook more evenly but more importantly you can actually season right inside the steak this little bit of fat down here season that as well because that is what we want to roast and get that really nice and rendered olive oil in a tablespoon roll that round as it starts to smoke in with the steaks into the pan and lay away again into the pan and lay away if you don't hear that noise the minute those steaks hit the pan don't put them in so the secret now is getting that color on the steak turning it once and once only and cooking it for two and a half minutes each side what I want to do is to get that bit of fat rendered so it adds a lot more flavor just hold the steak down like that and that starts to melt the fat which makes it so much more tender there should be no white fat left anywhere turn them over really important to have that stake up to room temperature before you start cooking it so the inside is nice and warm so he spend less time in the pan and more time cooling down really important now two fingers touch it goes in it says rare I'm happy for them to be rare Because by the time I let them rest I'm going to go back to medium rare it'll continue cooking out onto a plate and let them rest one two get my juices over don't waste that really important next the spicy dressing take the seeds out of a chili to reduce the heat by rubbing it in your hands and tapping until the seeds fall out cut it in half and just chop it in garlic and chili Works brilliantly a quick way of peeling it to get your knife and just slam it down it pops out very very quickly in it'll touch the salt rub start going around in circles first you'll see it purring nice clear that off now we've got the heat in there from the chili and that richness from the garlic two teaspoons of palm sugar this is where it starts to have that nice sweet sour effect fish sauce fresh lime this is a simple fresh chili dressing and it was something I fell in love with in Vietnam and Cambodia because it was just so easy give that a little mix and dissolve the sugar quick taste wow right vegetables great fuss-free way to get super thin ribbons of carrot is to use a veg peeler when they're that thin they take the vinaigrette so much better and radishes just slice them down at an angle lovely to give another dimension of the salad and we use a banana shallot they are incredibly mellow pretty sweet across just chop up the shalom and mix that through I want some Sweetness in there now little Vine Tomatoes slice them in half tomatoes in shallot radish carrots and tomatoes next peel and sliced cucumber chopped spring onions and Shred baby gem lettuce and then finally get some fresh mint it's young mint so you don't need to take all those stalks off all you do is hold a bunch upside down and then take it for a little trim and just chop that once through through look at that nice minted salad a couple of tablespoons of dressing don't flood the salad with the dressing you can always add but we can't take it away now really mix that dressing in there make sure all that chili and garlic and palm sugar wraps around that salad beautiful onto the plate the steaks rested it's now nice and medium rare a little bit of fat we don't want to find that in the salad just slice that off that serves its purpose kept that steak nice and moist slice going with the grain it's almost like slicing through butter and look inside beautiful pink you slice the beef too thinly then it goes Stone Cold and more importantly all the goodness runs out of it nice thick slices get the beef and start placing it around the salad take a little teaspoon of your dressing the rest of your salad sit that on top and finish it off with some toasted peanuts peanuts in now there's nuts are really toasted nuts on get another pan and just a crush once they've cooled down just run them through with a knife you can hear how crunch they are another texture under the taste of the salad and then from there sprinkle finally take that just finish it with a little tablespoon of that sauce and there is one tasty very well textured spicy beef salad [Music] Follow My ultimate cookery course crammed with key lessons top tips and 100 recipes to stay your life on and you'll literally be cooking yourself

once twice a week I treated myself to the most amazing bold breakfast and it started off with these Beauties here mergys cheap but incredibly tasty start off with a nice hot pan my gaze in it's a very spicy sausage doesn't need any help doesn't need any chili just a touch of salt and pepper you can smell the spice they're starting to release all that wonderful oil that flavor in there add a couple of cloves I'll finely sliced garlic spread the garlic across the pan it instantly changes color takes on this nice dark Rich golden color now take a look with the heat out for the parsley the stalks of soft herbs like parsley and coriander can be used in part flavor during cooking but the leaves should always be added just before serving to give maximum color and fragrance [Music] and then finish that off with my capers myself now take your quest on they're literally 24 hours old so they're crispy on the outside and just slice off the lid this recipe is a great way to use up any leftover croissants from the day before I used to cringe when I saw the French Cooks throw away croissants I used to cry thinking oh my God if you any idea what you're throwing away in terms of flavor whatever you do do not wipe out that pan dunk your croissants mopping up all that amazing flavor and caramelizing the inside for that beautiful don't forget the lids then get your thumbs and go inside the croissant all I want to do now is just create a little pocket and just manipulate the croissant now this is where it gets exciting mix up the Capers the garlic the sausages look at the color all that wonderful delicious flavored oil now some cheese but not just any cheese Fontina cheese is like the number one cheese for grilling and because it's a very rich cheese you shave it thinner than you would a white truffle but it gives a really nice saltiness and a light Smoky flavor Touch of Pepper with salt place these big boys on the tray literally 30 seconds on the grill here we go nice crisp packs full of Flavor now top them and that for me it's almost like being back in Paris except this time I don't have to share them with the French My ultimate big and bold breakfast mergers and Fontina stuff croissants a great way to start the day boiled eggs with a soldier that will make your taste buds stand to attention there's something quite nostalgic about a bald egg it's something that's never lost it's magic when you slice that top off and dunk that Soldier into the yolk you can't mess with a deliciously runny yolk but this is what I like to dunk in it an anchovy Soldier anchovies into pessim water no salt naturally yeah anchovies are very salty so just a touch of pepper rich in Omega-3s the amazing tinned anchovy is a natural flavor enhancer and I use it to Pepper many a Savory dish from roast lamb to the humble toasted Soldier grind them it's a really nice smooth paste the smell of that is almost like being on the seaside now get your soft butter and just put half the butter in first 50 50 is the way 50 anchovy if you send butter that way you've got that real nice salty creaminess mix that up foreign that's absolutely delicious trust me finishing that anchovy butter on a slice of grilled fish I'm in heaven the bread this is a Sourdough delicious very crusty take four nice slices now get that pan nice and hot a couple of tablespoons of that anchovy oil into the pan and then get your bread and lightly fry each side the smell of the anchovy oil is incredible take that out now bring your water up to the boil The Secret of softly boiling an egg is to place them into the water gently on a spoon in and just tilt so they don't hit the bottom nice and Light up to the ball count to five turn the gas down is it four and a half minutes is it five minutes for soft boiled egg I've cooked thousands of them and every time four and a half minutes whilst that's boiling get your bread spread that on there that is incredible chopped parsley brings that kind of freshness goes brilliantly well with the anchovies hear that crunch on in cyber I can't resist oh my God right gas off one Beauty in two I feel like a five-year-old again this is that moment when you open the vault and that little magic inside is all yours there's a great Twist on a great classic wow [Music] perfectly soft boiled eggs with dressed up anchovy butter soldiers of eggs benedict with Crispy Parma ham the secret behind a great eggs benedict is in the hollandaise so get your pan on because I'm going to cook a hollandaise over a rolling boil with a glass bowl butter just put it on to melt three egg yolks separated from the white tarragon vinegar pop that into the eggs if you can't get turkey vinegar any white wine vinegar will do just as long as you've got that acidity in there give some bite to the hollandaise put your bowl over the Rolling Water and just start whisking if the eggs had Direct contact with the gas pollen days will become scrambled egg once you've got that nice creamy texture a nice thick Sauvignon start adding your butter nice and slowly a couple of tablespoons of butter in and give that a really nice mix if you don't whisk it enough the egg yolks don't take the butter it causes it to split it's more butter using a big balloon whisk like this one makes it easier to incorporate air and helps prevent your mixture from separating all the butter in and the best way to keep hollandaise nice and warm is just leave it to sit over that nice warm water bath and it just gives it a really nice room temperature a nice pinch of salt fresh pepper and then fresh lemon juice that just really makes it vibrant exciting and you want to it's like a sort of thick custard I just want it to coat the back of the spoon so it's like you're giving the a nice glossy texture to your beautiful poached egg now as the base for the eggs benedict you cannot beat English muffins but the ham and we'll change I'm going to use the most amazing Parma ham get your pan nice and hot into the pan it's like Posh rashes of bacon beautiful [Music] ham fried nice and crisp though that is incredible beautiful in salads fantastic for eggs Benedict [Music] now keep that pan nice and hot I want all that flavor on the Parma ham left in there and rather than toast my muffins I want to put the muffins into the pan I want them sucking up all that wonderful flavor from that crispy Parma ham make sure your muffins are toasted nicely this will prevent them going soggy later look at that nice and crisp now water on to boil for the eggs nicely seasoned really important and then just a little splash of vinegar in the water that helps the set the egg white in a minute you crack it in while the water heats up in the pan there's time to get organized lay a nice slice of ham on the base now water's brought up to the ball turn it down and then spin your water around like a little whirlpool don't get a little cup so you just drop the cup in hello what happens to the egg gets caught up in the turbulence of the water the secret is not the ball the water rapidly because the strength of the ball can literally explode your egg as they start to move their way up to the top of the water that's a indication that they're cooked take off any excess little bits of egg white and then out onto a piece of tissue paper that just drains off excess water that stops your muffin from going really soggy but look they're like little beautiful mozzarella balls give them a little season left them on to a crispy Parma ham peaceful now get a nice spoon of your hollandaise glaze over try and do it in one glazing over the whole egg when I tell Jack Holly and Megan I'm Matilda that we're cooking eggs benedict for breakfast they bolt down the stairs and let's be honest who wouldn't run to sit in front of those [Music] I don't know a special occasion breakfast that would make anyone feel spoiled eggs benedict with Crispy Parma ham beauties [Music]

a simple slow roast tomato and Watercress salad these cherry tomatoes are perfect if you haven't got cherry tomatoes Vita Tomatoes good or even just big normal plum tomatoes lay the tomatoes on the tray and these go into the oven for about 90 minutes if you turn the oven down really low you can leave them in overnight to be honest the longer you leave them the better they taste once you've seasoned them with salt sprinkle over with some sugar on the salt and sugar combined speeds up the drying process because you want that nice chewy texture and then you get these little thyme flowers and just pick off the buds garlic sliced then just spread that on now the tray looks quite full and compact for 90 minutes in the oven you'll see everything shrink down all the Skins blistering and the flavor intensifies so nicely extra virgin olive oil that gives a nice earthy flavor to the tomatoes place your Tomatoes into an oven preheated to 150 degrees C and cook long and slow for an hour and a half now halloumi cakes there's something quite exciting about halloumi cheese it's a very firm cheese and it fries brilliantly [Music] fill the carrots [Music] great not too finely you want that nice texture next courgette the secret is keeping it all grated the same put that into a sieve a sprinkling of salt will draw out liquid from the vegetables then grate the halloumi halloumi cheese doesn't look that tasty but once you've got color on it in the pan it's really really delicious now really important to squeeze out the excess water from the veg and we'll see all that water that needs to come out of there if we didn't do this it'll make your little patties non-friable because the whole thing starts to separate and then mix in with the cheese spring onions chop up the whites and the greens now we're going to season that with some delicious fresh mint and fresh coriander whenever it's vegetarian I like to put a combination of herbs in there tarragon and parsley minted coriander basil and lemongrass all delicious on their own but in tandem their flavors play off each other next two eggs in give that a little mix add the eggs to the mixture and then finally a couple of tablespoons of breadcrumbs the breadcrumbs help dry out any excess moisture mix all the ingredients together before you start shaping these taste the mixture it's really important to identify the seasoning now if you wait until you've cooked them it'll be too late to adjust the seasoning roll them to a large golf ball shape them it's like a little mini burger you can spice these up with some chili in there if you haven't got fresh chili chili flakes and it's something that can be done up a day in advance to get your cakes firm and ready for frying put them into the fridge uncovered for 25 minutes pan on get that nice and hot boss and wait for that I'll get the dressing ready slice of red chili seeds and all on an angle into shards then chop fresh ginger season with a Sprinkle of sugar and salt add some rice wine vinegar add a couple of tablespoons of olive oil to finish off some chopped coriander [Music] because that's sweet sour spicy flavor with my chili dressing done I can start frying off my halloumi cakes in a hot oiled pan look at that nice crisp Edge you can already start to smell that sauteed halloumi with the courgettes and carrots smells delicious really important for a nice amount of color on them as my cakes Sizzle away I can finish off with my roast tomato salad one of my favorite leaves has to be border Crest it's cut off stalks [Music] foreign s Watercress and shallot they're brilliantly well together shallot looks so dainty when you open up these little ringlets [Music] don't forget to turn your cakes now Tomatoes whatever you don't use just jar them and put them in the fridge [Music] just drop those slow cooked warm Tomatoes over the Watercress the sweetness is incredible absolutely delicious a little drizzle of age of ultimate vinegar gives that tartness to the watercress Watercress is naturally peppery so it doesn't need any pepper just a little touch of salt and then a light sprinkling of extra virgin olive oil after five minutes on a medium heat my halloumi cakes are ready so important to have taken out that water [Music] you can see it doesn't disintegrate and then just get your dressing take a spoon of it and then tilt it to the side because I want the garnish I don't want the juice but that does not turn you on to become a vegetarian for the night I honestly don't know what will delicious [Music] my crispy golden halloumi courgette and Herb cakes with a Sumptuous roast tomato and Watercress salad all of the flavor with none of the meat My ultimate comfort food dinner is a stunning sausage Hot Pot

layers of potato and beetroot seasoning in between foreign with a neat layer of potatoes and pour the hot cream over the top bake in a preheated oven for an hour or until the potatoes are tender

four nice slices of fresh ginger and three little cinnamon sticks I want you to remember that because we're going to look for them okay because once we use them and they've worked their magic I need

kitchen easier first up how to keep your knife Sharp it's far harder working in the kitchen with a blunt knife than it is with a sharp knife the secret behind keeping a sharp knife sharpen it before and every time you use it first grip the steel feel really comfortable about holding the still imagine you're holding a tennis racket or you're playing squash you've got to be really comfortable with it now 45 degrees confident grip confident grip with a knife this is the butt of the steel really important to keep your fingers behind there you never grip a steel with your fingers over that because the knife comes back in you've just lost a finger always grip behind nice long strokes so we get the whole of the blade over Steel stroke and we start from the bottom to the top so there cross there across slow Strokes over the top of the steel and then come back underneath then back underneath it is so dangerous working in the kitchen with a blunt knife you can cause so much damage working with a sharp knife is 10 times quicker more efficient now that's ready to start chopping stop your chopping board rocking or slipping a great tip is to Simply wet a kitchen cloth kitchen paper or tea towel and place it underneath now you can chop with confidence my next top tip is get the most out of your humble veg peeler it's brilliant for slicing ultra thin ribbons of veg perfect for Asian dishes great for making long delicate parmesan shavings to top soups and salads it also makes wonderful chocolate curls your pepper mill is more versatile than you might think tighten the top screw to get finely ground pepper ideal for Soups and sauces for general seasoning you want it medium ground so set the screw in the middle and loosen it right off for coarse pepper perfect for steaks and fish [Music] peeling garlic for one clove simply bash it with a back of a knife and the skin comes off easily for a whole head Crush separate into a bowl cover and shake hard for about 10 seconds then simply pick out the peeled cloves [Music] this is my ultimate cookery course 100 recipes to stake your life on I'll be showing you a roast chicken recipe to die for hold the drum and slice straight through but first like any good Chef I'm always looking to get great ingredients at the right price my shopping Mantra is simple first rely on your senses make sure whatever you're buying it looks smells and really feels good and if you get the chance taste it before you buy it second is to recognize that knowledge is crucial the more you know about where your ingredients come from and how they produce the better so ask lots of questions and learn you're never too old to learn from experts and when it comes to buying great birds one person knows what to look for is award-winning fifth generation Master butcher Danny lidgate poultry is a great meet because there's many different types of birds it's worth tasting the variation of flavors between different first and first is massive turkey is a great lean meat that's available all year round not just for Christmas anybody who's worried about eating fatty Meats is a really healthy flavoursome meal okay game birds people don't try them often enough once they're shots they're hung up for a little while but a few days at least it means the meat's going to be more tender it all adds in flavor to the birds we've got a wood pigeon and a red leg Partridge both really good and cook really quickly when you're buying a chicken some of the things to look out for is obviously the smell and when you're smelling a good quality chicken you can tell the difference the Skin's a nice white color and it smells like a fresh chickeny smell when you're buying from a good butcher you'll find you tend to get the giblets as well which is basically the neck and other orgas this is great for making gravy once you have cooked it you can use all the off cuts for other things stir fries curries pasta dishes save the bones use the bones for stocks and soups a really packed full of flavor and remember there are lots of different breeds of chicken all have different characteristics and flavors so shop around and find the ones you love here are three of my all-time favorites the label onglay these come from an old British breed they've got smaller breasts but the meat's delicious the black leg a fantastic French variety succulent with bags of flavor and really meaty thighs and the police this is the Rolls-Royce of chickens Rich gamey and delicious one for special occasions I think people should maybe try and buy Less meat but aim for the best quality you're only going to get out what you put in by putting the best quality into a dish you're going to get the best results no matter how season the chef you are there are always new ingredients and recipes to get fired up about so if a tidal recipe is getting you down spice it up with fresh ideas and flavors this recipe is an old classic roast chicken but with a simple twist it takes on a new life and is guaranteed to impress one of the things I love about cooking and that keeps me excited after 25 years behind the stove is that there's always something new to learn every day new ingredients new techniques and new cuisines start off with the stuffing it's amazing how exciting a stuffed roast chicken can be because it keeps the chicken incredibly moist and gives a delicious texture inside the bird I'm going to start off with cured chorizo this is a traditional Spanish sausage and it's garlicky spicy incredibly meaty that gives a little bit of sort of richness to the stuffing get a freezer in start cooking that down and getting all those oils out little touch the olive oil in there to get it going right onions chopped add the onions to the chorizo and in a matter of seconds they'll change color as they soak up all the flavor that lovely spiciness has been stolen from that sausage and now the onions smell incredible garlic garlic in fresh thyme just hold it down and put your fingers on there and it's a really nice way of taking off all those nice fragrant little time flowers you can hear it cracking in the background these are cannellini beans they're waxy very soft and so delicious but very dense but for stuffing they're so robust nothing breaks down drain them off in they're going to take on all that juice as well from this freezer I'm going to season them now because they're very dense so it needs some help and that looks like it's a dish on its own good enough to eat now I want to sweeten things up a little bit Tomatoes half dried in that sweetens up the stuffing beautiful the stuffing's ready look at the color everything Spanish it looks delicious now stuffing the chicken I like taking off these little knuckles as the chicken Cooks the skin stretches over the bone you can get a really nice drum and take off those little wing tips as well salt pepper so important now you're stuffing I want to go right inside the chicken push it down this really helps to cook the bird evenly because you're pushing out all the empty spaces in the carcass and take a nice large Lemon push the lemon in pick up the parcel's nose pull the skin over olive oil on top sauce pepper a teaspoon of paprika sprinkle it on and then get your hands and sort of rub that in and see what the paprika's doing to the chicken putting this like sweet spicy marinade it's not even roasted yet but it looks delicious [Music] 400 ml white wine same quantity of water that helps the chicken to steam Chicken in be generous with the time Sprigs make sure the fall is folded tightly around the roasting tray so the chicken steams in the oven keeping it moist and juicy into the oven [Music] cook for one hour at 180 degrees with a foil on nice take it out and remove the full lid then give it another 30 minutes to crisp up that skin look at that so important to make sure you take that tinfoil off with half an hour to go beautiful Pierce that open squeeze it in that delicious gravy mix that into the tray sieve that that's a really nice fragrant lemony spiced roasting juices to finish before we cut up the chicken take out amazing stuffing [Music] incredible I'd have that with chicken over potatoes any day and then just get your chicken roasting juices now cut the chicken up hold the drum and slice straight through and there's that wonderful

recipes to take your life on right this is my guide to cooking with spice adding big gutsy flavors using spices at the beginning of cooking and then simply letting the dish slow cook is a brilliant way of getting maximum flavor with minimum effort my first recipe melts in the mouth and because the oven does most of the work it's a cinch to make slow cooked fiery lamb cooking's all about being bold and adventurous and this dish is exciting because it's slowly cooked and the longer it Cooks the more flavor something it becomes marinating the lamb first chilies we're going to use a mixture of red and green take off the tops and just slice in garlic crushed don't worry about chopping these ultra fine just get it in there cooking for up to three hours everything sort of Blends and almost sort of purees itself together smoke paprika goes brilliantly well with the chilies two teaspoons in a touch of dried oregano some little cumin seeds the blend and the fragrance that they give out is extraordinary they release a little oil as well and helps to tenderize the lamb touch of salt pepper cinnamon that sort of sweetens up the lamb olive oil just a tablespoon and the olive oil helps to sort of stick all those wonderful spices to the lamb Chomp in just start really rubbing at this stage you can leave the lamb to marinade for anything from half an hour to overnight allowing the spices to really penetrate the meat giving amazing results when you tuck in delicious vegetables carrots and onions and that's it sliced cigarette slicing vegetables for braising is not getting too thin you slice the onions too thin they burn you've got that horrible Char taste on that slow braised braising it's just a chef's term that means cooking in liquid on a low heat making the meat incredibly moist and beautifully tender so the secret of braising is having a really nice thick durable pan get that nice and hot Touch of olive oil lemon hold the bone because you're in control then into the pan you want that white fat to start rendering so it'll add more fat therefore making it a lot more flavoursome as it braises chillers cinnamon in mix that up and don't be scared you're not burning this you're sort of searing the lamb shanks and this is the important part right at the very beginning we're going to color on the lamb which washes off as it braises in the oven so be generous with that color vegetables in wow and then a couple of Baileys so now you lift the lamb up and get the lamb sat on top of the vegetables now the glaze the pan with red wine the glazing means that you're cleaning the bottom of the pan and you're getting that amazing flavor washed off and lifted up into that sauce it can really transform that dish always delays then bring it to the boil and cook for about 10 minutes to reduce the wines reduced down by half now for the stock bring that stock back up to the ball and then into the oven now don't cover it when you cover it all the condensation comes off the lid your lamb becomes gray all this effort and that exciting spice gets washed away no lid and in the oven for three hours a slow cook on a low heat of 160 degrees gives the spices time to work and transform the meat so it's mouth-waterly tender now look at those out on to a plate you can just see that meat sliding down juicy and creamy tender grab it by the the shank rolling around that rich delicious sauce look at that and get your sauce beautiful let's get some mint don't chop it just pick that fresh mint and let it snow and there you go a very spicy delicious melting in the mouth lamb shank amazing to get the most out of your spices there's only one piece of kit that you need pestle and water I mean they look fantastic and it's essential for any good kitchen these things

more stunning recipes that make cooking with spice simple incredible [Music] this is my guide to cooking with spice next up my shopping guide to buying spices [Music] when I buy my spice I only want the best and it always pays to get expert advice Burger has been selling every spice Under the Sun in London's Notting Hill for over 20 years so she really knows what she's talking about I love spices to smell all the texture to color spices are so versatile something very very simple can be really transformed into something really delicious with thousands of aromatic ingredients on a shelf if it smells good she sells it if you're buying spices buy them whole then you can try roast them crying the men you need them and then they will release the essential oils whole spices you can keep for years give them a good bushing wine bottle with your rolling pin or whatever and you see there is still Aroma and you can taste it you smell it then it's fine there's four main spices one is sweet one is sour one is bitter and one is hot this is cinnamon and that is really a great example of a sweet spice when you buy a cinnamon quill like this you have to check that you have loads of different layers in here then you can either grind this or you'd break a piece off I mean this doesn't smell of anything now but if you roll it in your hand just quickly like this and then you smell it again this is just unbelievable if you have spaghetti bolognese put a pinch of cinnamon in it to bring out the flavor this is one of those really special spices sour like a lemon but it has a salty aftertaste I use this anywhere for marinades to salad you haven't left unless you tried it a great example for a bitter spice would actually be a turmeric this is actually a root it grows in the ground like ginger use it very very sparingly about that much well actually color you a curry or a rice dish wonderful yellow watch your fingers you get really yellow fingers from it and then we come to the hot spices one spice that I couldn't miss and that is Hungarian paprika paprika is the powdery form of a bell pepper what makes the Hungarian paprika different is that they actually grow it in Vineyards it's sort of between the vines it has a sweetness and it has a sharpness to it I have it in ice cream I have it on fish I have it everywhere burger spot on about the power of spices to transform dishes where there's Savory or sweet here's my quick guide to the spices I use most spice I couldn't do without always buy a whole and grind yourself so you get the freshest flavor cardamom these pods come in green or black types and have a fantastic Spicy Sweet Taste brilliant for everything from curries to rice dishes and puddings coriander these citrusy seeds are perfect whole in pickles or grind to use in fragrant stews and soups cumin a Savory Spice that's pungent and nutty it's great in marinade for delicious Meat and Fish then cinnamon sweetly fragrant and great with apples or in cakes and Nutmeg warm and spicy it's delicious in a vegetable sauce finely saffron these sweet strands Infuse a brilliant bright red color and are great in risottos and even though it's more expensive than gold a pinch goes a long long way store your spices properly and they'll last for years you keep it airtight in a tin or in a glass chair in your cupboard don't be scared of spices like an aftershave or a perfume you have to select it yourself it has to fit in with your taste and with your kitchen supermarkets and good local shops sell an amazing array of different spices so there's no excuse for not being adventurous be bold find what you like and spice up your cooking like all chefs I love the challenge of transforming classic recipes giving them a new twist to make them modern and vibrant to keep old dishes fresh and exciting it's great to get spicy my next recipe is a time-honored British classic but with addition of spices it's given a new lease of Life fragrant spice rice pudding I love cooking with spices but you don't have to just cook Savory dishes using aromatics and spices across desserts takes your puddings to a completely different level [Music] first off our spices this is a fresh vanilla pod fragrant and packed full of flavor use the back of the knife and flatten it that removes all those little seeds off the skin of the vanilla pod take your knife slice down the middle and then when you open that up the smell is incredible take the tip of the knife and you scrape inside and look at all those seeds dying to come out that is incredible there are thousands of seeds still ingrained to the Pod so put them in to the casserole cardamom powerful spicy take two little pods place your knife on top lightly crack them cracking the cardamom pods helps release all the amazing flavor cloves because of that kind of aniseed flavor with a lot of depth one two three cinnamon stick snap and in just smelling that level of fragrance you can imagine what the rice pudding is in the taste of turn on the heat lightly toast those spices just a couple of seconds and what's going to happen is just going to sort of enhance those spices in a way that it just draws out an even more powerful fragrance coconut milk in sugar two tablespoons milk and then a couple of tablespoons of cream bring it slowly to the boil to allow the flavors to infuse and this rice pudding reminds me of my time in India where I got really into that chai tea fragrance because it was just so delicious and so comforting take a lime in the lime just cuts through the richness of the coconut gives it that nice little bit of acidity goes fantastically well with the cinnamon and that fresh vanilla nice have a taste now let's come up to the boil give it a nice little clean around the outside and in with the rice use 200 grams of pudding rice don't wash it beforehand because the starch helps thicken the rice pudding in the oven and just turn that down to a light simmer and the pudding rice starts to open up and it absorbs all that coconut vanilla cardamom clove and cinnamon bring it to the ball gently and cook it out three to five minutes bullying it rapidly the rice opens up and it goes into mush I want to keep that nice texture of that sort of fragrant rice pudding on a gentle simmer next a little luxury I'm going to show you how I take this simple delicious aromatic rice pudding to a completely different level here's what I do take two egg yolks separating them and give that a really nice whisk two nice tablespoons of mascarpone cheese we started into the egg yolks so it's nice and smooth it's almost like finishing the rice pudding in a delicious custard turn off the gas add that into the rice pudding what happens it starts to enrich and really thicken this rice pudding and takes it to a completely different level the rice is still not cooked started to go nice and soft you can just see how it's opening up but looks like Rich aromatic lava bubbling away finally Great Mall Citrus zest the lime on top roasted caramelized lime zest on top of a rice pudding is phenomenal then put it in the oven for 15 minutes at 200 degrees to finish cooking the rice and develop the intensely aromatic flavors look at that an incredibly fragrant rice pudding how beautiful does that look spices are a brilliant way of helping classic dishes come alive I'll guarantee you'll never ever have had a rice pudding like this before next my tricks of the trays and kitchen tips first how to zest the lemon the important part is not to zest any of the pith watch the following technique and I'll show you how we've got these original graters really important when we use this which is the fine zester not the big rough one not the one for slicing and not the other one for grating this little one here onto a plate because it's always easier to lift off on the plate than it is the board and the most important thing about zesting a lemon is nice long strokes but twisting the lemon round every time we go down we twist same with the orange and same with the lime tap if you go too far let me just show you look we've got that white bitter pith that destroys the wonderful zesty flavor and look that's what we're looking for there this really nice vibrant lemon zest delicious garlic is a key ingredient in so many spicy dishes my tip for finely chopping and mincing is add a pinch of salt for abrasion which helps break the fibers of the garlic down for a much better result for getting the most out of root Ginger simply remove the skin using a teaspoon it's easier than using a knife and you can get around the tricky bits or just keep the skin on and give it a good wash never throw out vanilla pods there's a ton of flavor left in the skin stick inside jars of sugar and leave to infuse great to sprinkle on cakes biscuits or porridge when grinding up spices if you have any left over you can store in an airtight jar for up to two months great for a spicy kick to have at your fingertips foreign My ultimate cookery course crammed with key lessons up tips and 100 recipes to stay your life on and you'll literally

jobs was working in a chip shop I used to put sacks and sacks of potatoes into the rumbler which was then the potato peeler all day long today I'm gonna do something a bit healthier for my oven chips with a Twist simply peel slice and Blanche for three to four minutes drain season uncover well with Paprika spread evenly over an oiled baking tray and place into a preheated oven for 20 minutes simple as that next up easy fish fingers this is Pollock a really nice firm delicious fish cut the fish and finger size battens of fish put them onto your plate and just lightly salt them you can do that literally 20 minutes 30 minutes before you start cooking the fish firms the fish up beautifully and it allows it to become a little more durable especially in the pan now for the coating start by thoroughly coating the fish in seasoned flour and then just roll it to get rid of those little sharp corners because then it stops those Corners almost burning in a pan in to your egg wash and really coat them wonderful and then this is Dill goes brilliantly well with the fish and run the deal through my breadcrumbs that makes it more aromatic lay them onto your breadcrumbs nothing wrong with the chip butty nothing wrong with fish fingers let's give it a lovely modern twist beautiful once the fish fingers are thoroughly coated they're ready to pan fry and they'll need around three minutes on each side I want the fish fingers to be nice and crispy get a really nice color on them first and then we'll flip them over and finish them with butter bring the heat up into the pan a nice little knob of butter that'll work wonders where the breadcrumbs and the deal nice and carefully take them out hey look and smell incredible stay nice and crispy now to assemble my chip buddy starting with button thick crusty bread foreign mop up that amazing flavor on slice in half never slice in an angle my mouth is salivating beautiful on with a ship buddy there's one thing missing and it signifies that I've never forgotten the joy I've come for food but my God that makes me feel like a nine-year-old excuse me for one moment I want to stuff my face [Applause] [Music] homemade fish fingers are my ultimate chip buddy so simple to make but trust me it tastes amazing cooking scrummy sardines topped with a fragrant gremolata dressing but first a deliciously fresh orzo pasta salad this is one of the Hidden Delicacies of Italian pasta also because 90 of the time it's always hidden in a soup or a brothel minestrone and it looks like large grains of rice but once they absorb that water they double in size It's a pasta that needs a lot of help season it nicely pinch of salt and splash of extra virgin olive oil fresh bay leaf into the boiling water and that bay leaf really helps to flavor the pasta give you a little pan turn left and right that stops any pasta sticking to the bottom and the secret behind cooking any pasta is having a nice gentle rolling boil you just have the gas up where the outside of the pan is just rolling and all that also is tumbling over each other gently boiling past the rapidly tends to destroy the outside texture it doesn't take the marinade or the vinaigrette or the sauce for the dressing parmesan Twist of fresh pepper the zest of the lemon I'll squeeze your lemon in there through your fingers to catch all those seeds bring that together with some extra virgin olive oil foreign s taste delicious toasting them just elevates them after eight minutes my orzo is perfectly al dente train it a little bit of cold water through it close the cooking process down let's stop it from going mushy it's the size of pumpkin seeds now a drizzle of olive oil and into the vinaigrette whilst it's still warm just above room temperature because the warmer the pasta the more it absorbs the vinaigrette and now some texture rocket not finely chopped on the fresh basil as well roll them up like a big fat cigar slice in half and then chop the basil crunch just sprinkle the toasty pine nuts it looks like a plate of jewels glistens it's delicious very fragrant also pasta salad now for sardines incredibly healthy an absolutely delicious grilled never ever be intimidated on looking for fresh fish it's about the condition of the fish Bright Eyes fresh gills nice bright red interior and the firmness of the flesh almost you could stand the fish up on his own it needs to be that fresh the best way to get flavor into sardine just to grill it light seasoning olive oil and just roll the seasoning around get your Rosemary peel off a few of the little shards at the end so it's a little bit sharp push the Rosemary in almost like a Threading makes them so much more flavoursome they'll be scared of those fine little bones I remember growing up with sardines tin sardines you didn't tongue your nose up at the bone once The Griddle pan starts to smoke lightly drizzle and then sardines on two and a half for three minutes each side now for the gremlinata a vinaigrette that sits beautifully well on the sardines freshly fastly just run the knife once nothing worse when you over chop parsley and all that delicious flavors left on the board the zest and juice of an orange and the lemon turn them now grandma that's about fragrance natural flavors brilliant for grilled Meats as well a little touch of salt and pepper and then olive oil just to bring it together the garlic I almost want to be like a secret weapon in there raise it bring that together you've got a very fresh clean gremolata almost if we're sat on the Amalfi Coast off then once the sardines are still nice and warm and just thinly coat the gremolata I'd like to pass in the garlic to sit on top and that's citrus from the lemon and the orange to sort of dive underneath see why Italian cuisine rides on the freshest and the simplest execution they allow their ingredients to become the hero not the chef also salad with stunning grilled sardines [Music] wherever you eat this dish it will fill your senses with the sun and the Sea of the Mediterranean delicious [Music] foreign

take your life on right now it's all about making it easy [Music] making it easy for yourself in the kitchen means using the time you have effectively and the one thing that can really help you do that is your freezer [Music] my recipe for meatballs is so versatile it can be used to make a dozen amazing dishes one of my favorites is meatballs in fragrant coconut broth having a freezer of home-cooked delicious food ready to go can be a real life saver it means you never have to compromise on Flavor these meatballs are delicious but more importantly they freeze so well first off get your pan on and start sweating off the onions and your garlic this recipe involves making the meatballs a classic way but the exciting part is actually cook them in coconut milk and it gives a really nice new dimension to a sort of soft Rich Sumptuous meatball chop the onion nice and finely keeping those slices very close together close to the slices the finer the onions cut it back down at an angle slice down and just chop I want the onions nice and fine because I want some finesse to these meatballs The Secret of a really good meatball is the texture getting that balance right between the minced beef the bread crumbs the milk and the seasoning a couple of cloves of garlic slice of garlic really nice and thinly nice pan nice and hot a tablespoon of olive oil quite generous available onions and garlic in a little touch of salt and pepper with your mince open it up a little bit and sort of cut it out that salt and pepper for me a good meatball is all about the the softness the texture of that Rich beef and the way it sort of melts in your mouth you can color it on the outside but you want it nice and soft and sort of rich in the center mix that in beautifully and then place it back out again I've got some really nice dried chili flakes I'm going to season the onions with the chili flakes chili flakes in cook that out for two minutes I'm gonna add some milk [Music] take your breadcrumbs make a little well three four tablespoons of milk that makes it sort of nice slightly doughy texture but it lightens the texture of the meatball place that in add your onions your garlic and your chili in there as well nice put your hands in there and start mixing them if you've got the right amount of milk and breadcrumbs it doesn't mean binding with an egg don't make them too small the problem with making them too small is the fact that they dry out quickly just size of a golf ball a little bit bigger nice give him a really nice tight squeeze that stops IT from breaking up it always pays to double the recipe and spend a bit more time making extra meatballs so you can freeze a batch ready for another time give the pan a little wipe out don't wash out that pan we've got that flavor from the onions the garlic at the bottom look at that pan nice and hot Taste of olive oil in there place them the top of your pan nice and gently set them in the oil get a palette knife and go underneath them and just sort of tilt the pan and let the pan cook the back of the meatball we're going to add some heat coriander seeds slightly spicy and peppery because they give a really nice flavor to the coconut milk in next some cardamom seeds three or four onto the board knife on in a little touch of turmeric into the center of the pan that's going to give it a really nice spicy flavor a little pinch cinnamon all the time you're doing this those meatballs are just getting tastier and tastier a couple of dried chilies let them Infuse in that oil and then some lemongrass just take the back of your knife and sort of Beat It Down that starts to release all that lovely sort of fragrance like someone's just let off the most amazing fragrant air freshener in for the lemongrass finally some fresh ginger peel it's nice nice and thinly time now turn them over and let the other half for a wonderful flavor to stop in bring the stock up to the boil turn the gas up and then add the coconut milk and I want the coconut milk just sitting underneath the top of a meatball coconut milk in and that sort of gives it that creamy richness but it's not heavy it's a fragrant light richness before we start simmering check the seasoning that nice soft texture of the meatball but that fragrance light richness of the coconut broth it's going to cook those meatballs perfectly bring the broth up to the boil and simmer gently for eight to ten minutes touch them with your finger they should be slightly pliable but slightly springy gas off and finish it off with something light and fresh zest of lime I don't want the zest on top of the meatball sort of cut through that richness and then finally squeeze fresh lime and that just gives it that nice zesty amazing taste stirring the juice [Music] it's got that kick and that vibrant taste now the exciting part when you come to serve it be generous with that coconut broth talk the pan get a good couple of ladles of a broth in meatball [Music] and that is a very delicious way of eating a old-fashioned meatball and bringing it into the 21st century and they're just as good cooked from Frozen as well [Music] the secret to stress-free cooking is making it easy for yourself here are three more recipes all based on my delicious freezer friendly meatballs just defrost them before you get started first up beef meatballs with ariketti kale and pine nuts [Music] the hot oil Brown meanwhile cook origetti pasta then add chopped garlic to the meatballs and shredded kale a delicious green veg packed with vitamins which Cooks in minutes cabbage is a great alternative if you can't get kale put in some of the cooking water from the pasta to steam through when the pasta is cooked al dente drain and add to the meatballs season then finish with sweet buttery pine nuts and grated fresh Parmesan cheese meatballs with other Kitty kale and pine nuts from meatballs to meal in minutes my next easy standby supper is beef meatball sandwich with melting mozzarella and tomato salsa [Music] top a lightly Toasted Roll with pan-fried meatballs then tear up chunks of creamy buffalo mozzarella pile it on and melt it under the grill for the Tangy salsa sliced sweet red onion then add juicy diced tomatoes and roughly chopped fresh coriander Eason and drizzle with olive oil spoon over [Music] perfect in a Flash beef meatball

hot olive oil cumin seeds for warmth and add your meatballs cook on a high heat to get all those aromatic flavors out once the meatballs are browned add hot chili paste for a spicy kick tinned tomatoes dried oregano and a liter of beef stock [Music] then simmer next add sweet corn and chopped courgettes [Music] to finish add hot jalapeno peppers chop fresh coriander and crushed tortilla chips and pop meatball wonder that really packs a punch fiery meatball soup [Music] one versatile meatball recipe four deliciously different dishes food that's certain to make your life in the kitchen easier and stress-free amazing whether you're making great food to freeze or to take straight to the table you need to know how to shop for the best ingredients next up my shopping guide to oils it doesn't matter if you're baking frying or dressing salads using the right oil can dramatically alter The Taste and texture here are the most common oils and what to use them for sunflower oil is a good value all-rounder nice and light for frying bacon in dressings and spicy dishes ground nuts or peanut oil is great for cooking on high heat as it gets really hot without burning sesame oil I flavoursome sweet and nutty oil perfect sprinkled over Asian dishes before serving rapeseed oil is a healthier choice for using in salads I love walnut oil fantastically fragrant it's brilliant for salad dressings and it gives cakes a distinctive flavor oil I use most in my cooking is olive oil [Music] to find some of the best olive oils sold in Britain get to go to one of the most unlikely places an electrical shop in London's East End [Music] turkish-born Mehmet morat has olive oil in his blood my families produce this olive oil for centuries what he doesn't know about it isn't worth knowing the very best extra virgin olive oil is first cold pressed it's actually pressed by Stone and then it's put for a centrifugal spinner which spins out all the bitter Waters and then you've got

ultimate cookery course next are my guide to making it easy I'll be creating a sweet treat to drool over I want the chocolate my little matchsticks dotted around but first my quick guide to the basic kit you need to get cooking fantastic food you don't need to spend a fortune on masses of kitchen equipment here are three more Kitchen Essentials whisk spoon and spatula these three items are so cheap yet they are so important to Great home cooking a whisk there's so much more control when you've got something whisking in your hand you can gauge it so much better than you can if it's an electric mixer bigger the balloon on your hand whisk the faster it will whip as it draws in more air Wooden Spoons don't scratch pans they should be washed by hand spatulas are indispensable for baking or mixing make sure it's heat resistant so it doesn't melt but more importantly phenomenal for making omelettes great with scrambled eggs and you waste nothing because the spatula almost cleans the bowl instantly with these three you'll be well on your way to cooking like a pro and you'll need all three for my next recipe [Music] my take on classic chocolate brownies is guaranteed to put a smile on anyone's face and not just when they're fresh out of the oven blondies stock up on these delicious blondies they'll keep for up to a week and it's a great way of getting ahead if you're expecting guests around first off melt the butter for the mixture we've had hundreds and hundreds of brownies the sort of white chocolate version I.E blondies are amazing a little bit more subtle keep a little knob of butter for the end just to grease your baking tray turn the gas down gently melt that butter sugar into the bowl [Music] let's give that butter a little whisk it sort of makes the mixture a bit lighter slightly fluffy off with the gas a pinch of salt in the sugar then make a little well in the middle and sort of whisk you can see it's already gone nice and blunt love it give that a really good mix and the secret with the butter be slightly warm sort of it melts the sugar lovely a teaspoon of vanilla extract in next lightning whisk in two whole eggs let's give it a little beat this is such a delicious recipe yeah it's so simple whisking the eggs looking for that nice sort of rich text just smooth paste see why we call these blondies beautiful next teaspoon of baking powder baking powder in half a teaspoon of baking soda aerates the mixture it gives it that little tartness you'll see the sort of Rise instantly in a minute they hit the oven and then your flour whisk with one hand and just slowly add half the flour first get that all mixed up make sure that mixture is really nice and smooth check it occasionally no lumps half a flour in and then the other half and you'll feel it sort of almost go nice and firm and that's why it's so important to add the flowering stages this stops the mixture going lumpy it should be just dropping off the Whisk beautiful change over from a whisk to a spoon next I want some texture some nice sweet chewiness to the blondies dried cranberries they bake beautifully but it gives the Blondie a really nice sort of chewy sweetness in the center next and white chocolate [Music] I'm not going to grate it just chop it up just slice it like little bits of shrapnel I want the chocolate my little matchsticks dotted around now chocolate in lovely fold that in I want a nice even distribution of those wonderful dried cranberries don't over mix it I want to break up that chocolate a nice even mix of cranberries and chocolate see the chocolate there'll be parts of the chocolate in the oven that will actually melt it'll be like little pools of white melted chocolate in the center now baking tray small little knob of butter and the grease baking tray and line it some greaseproof paper and just over extend it shiny side out dull side hits the bottom of the tray in creased proof allows me to maximize on the white chocolate inside the mix my grease with paper the chocolate can melt and almost stick to the tray so the paper is just a really nice insurance policy secondly we want that rise and that sort of crispness now with the mix get your spatula go all the way around I don't see anything left in that bowl position the ball over your tray nice and carefully don't leave that slice in the bowl nobody's licking that one and then just take the back of a spatula go into the corners push and come back into the middle turn the tray around let it work to your advantage try and get it evenly positioned in the tray if it goes in even it Cooks evenly make sure you smooth out the top of the Blondie with the back of the spatula and then into the oven it's going to rise it's nice and crisp on that soft gooiness in the center make your blondies at 180 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes foreign Edge on the outside and that sort of soft gooey Center leave that to cool down and it's going to sort of firm up and wrinkle but it'll stay nice and gooey in the center once it's cooled down take it out and start slicing [Music] after watching blondies a fantastic easy treat to have on hand for yourself or to share [Music] tricks of the trays and kitchen tips to make your life easier make sure you make the most of your freezer my tip for amazing tuna carpaccio is to freeze it first and it will slice beautifully why is this safe leftover wine for cooking my tip is to freeze the remaining wine and freezer bags or ice cube trays it's great in stocks and sauces when you freeze soups or stews in tubs the tip is not to overfill them leave room to expand in the container great tip for a cheap homemade ice cream by a high quality vanilla ice cream and make it your own by mixing in berries chocolate or my favorite rum and boozy raisins [Music] a fantastic tip for leftover lemons and limes is to cut them into wedges freeze and use them like ice cubes they won't water down your drink and they'll

amazing recipes are on my app please check out the app store for details go on get cooking Welcome to My ultimate cookery course packed with cooking tips information and 100 recipes to stay your life on right now it's all about stress-free cooking big dishes in advance is a brilliant way of taking the stress out of cooking at home and many dishes just get better and better with time first up amazing sticky pork ribs one of the secrets to Great cooking is patience leaving dishes to marinate for one or two days helps to develop the flavor in your food and the end result so much more delicious it's a method I use in the restaurants all the time first off get your roasting tray put the tray on the gas pork ribs 60 meat and 35 40 fat give them a really good season so and pepper nice thing about this cut they stay incredibly moist when they're on the bone and the longer you cook them the more delicious they become just push all that seasoning in to the pork olive oil in make sure that tray is nice and hot and I really want that nice sort of caramelization taking place on the pork that's the nice thing about starting it on top of the stove use your roasting tray get them colored and then in the oven putting the ribs straight in the oven you don't get the color it looks sort of boiled as opposed to a nice caramelized rib Ginger you can't beat fresh ginger with sticky pork ribs place it down nice and firmly and slice the thinner you slice the ginger the more fragrant the ribs garlic and it's really important before you add anything to those ribs make sure we've got the color and the ribs first don't rush it turn them over that's what I want a nice crispy color as they sort of raise in the oven all that color just turns into the most amazing flavor Brazil it's just a chef's term for cooking something slowly in liquid right ginger and garlic in spread it around on all those ribs to sort of roast the ginger and the garlic chili flakes chili flakes in next Szechuan pepper citrusy vibrant peppercorns incredible in next star anise that gives it a really nice sort of aniseedy flavor almost like you're roasting the ribs in fennel then now we've got the heat we've got the spice I want to sweeten things up a little bit some fresh honey glazes to Pork beautifully counteracts against all that Spice in there oh look what's happening color on the ribs is extraordinary it's like a really nice chili sweet caramel now soy sauce brings that little bit of sort of saltiness to it really generous with the soy sauce Japanese vinegar two tablespoons of vinegar in rice wine it gives it that nice sort of tartness to the ribs if you can't find rice wine a dry sherry is a great substitute 300 mil that takes out the heat of that Szechuan pepper those dried chili flakes make sure they're all laid down like a nice tight box of matches bring that up to the boil cooking is all about learning to develop your own likes and dislikes so always keep tasting to make sure you're happy with a combination of flavors slacking a little touch of vinegar on that sharpness now I think what's going on the tartness the heat the caramel the color on the ribs is amazing I want a bit of a sort of oniony flavor I'll put some spring onions in whilst these ribs are in the oven the spring onions will sort of puree they give a sharpness the final taste of that pork in in my spring onions and with my stock 400 mL of stock this is just a simple chicken stock the stock just sits underneath the ribs it absorbs into the rib and the top of the rib glazes underneath the rib and gets crispy and Rich and that's what makes the ribs nice and moist really important into the oven cook at 180 for 30 minutes then turn the ribs over and cook for a further 30 minutes [Music] now wow they smell incredible each side has got that really nice crispy roasted Edge becomes sticky and chewy and sweet sour the fat disappeared and the pork just melts in your mouth I want to take them to the next level gas back on now shake the tray and this is the sort of the way that we finish them in the restaurant but every minute they glaze in that tray they just get to taste better and better now look at them I'm so happy with those ribs done absolutely delicious now but if you want you can put them in the fridge and the flavor will keep developing then just reheat them when you want to serve so piece rib has a nice slice of Ginger on there [Music] wow look at that delicious sticky ribs with an amazing marinade to make my food the tastiest it can be I always start with the best ingredients I can find and the secret to getting the best is simple knowledge is crucial the more you know about where your ingredients come from and how they produce the better so ask lots of questions and learn when it comes to buying pork you can't do any better than ask a butcher and award-winning Master butcher Danny lidgate knows everything about the pig from Trotter to tail his family have been in the meat business for 150 years so this man really is on the money in comparison with other meats Paul from the Trotter down to the cheek we can see here we've got the leg the leg is about this region really lean really good for things like gammons and hams coming down from the leg we've got the loin and that's where the pork chops come from if you take the bones out you can bone and roll it and you end up with a really nice easy to cook cylinder of meat really easy to carve carve like a loaf of breads coming away from the loin we've got the belly and you can see where belly is made up of fatty parts and Meaty Parts don't be scared of the amount of fat that's on it you need that fat to give give the flavors coming through also make sure you can possibly buy it with the skin on the skin will Crispen up nicely give you a good crackling also add flavor into the fat lower down from the bellies we've got the shoulders really the shoulders are a great meet they're slightly fattier than the rest of the animal you can see with this pork shoulder the amount of marble you're getting the mussels the interior marbling make sure you look for the marbling it's essential for the flavor and it's going to make a really good eating experience I think there really is nothing to waste the truss is even a really good flavor because they're gelatinous qualities and the meat can be really really flavoursome also there's Pig's cheeks which obviously require a little bit more cooking because of the use they get but the flavors you're going to get are going to be completely different to any other part of a pig pork is an incredibly versatile mate they say the only part you can't eat is the Oink here's my guide to getting the best out of familiar cuts smoked or unsmoked bacon is not just for breakfast it's brilliant transforming salads gives a real depth of flavor to stews and is delicious in quick and easy pasta dishes [Music] the leg joint best known for ham also makes an inexpensive delicious Sunday roast and is great served with peas pudding and the tenderloin fillet incredibly lean healthy and fast to cook you can stuff it cut it into scallops or strips that are perfect for Asian stir fries [Music] a calm kitchen is an efficient and effective kitchen the less stressed you are the better the food you'll produce so whenever you can get ahead with your cooking here are three of my favorite recipes they've been made beforehand whose flavor improves over time foreign Lamb with sweet potato and raisin [Music] this super simple hassle-free recipe is cooked all in one pot start by Browning chunks of lamb in hot olive oil color and remove then fried onions season add chopped garlic ground ginger and coriander a teaspoon of whole cumin seeds paprika and fennel seeds a cinnamon stick bay leaf and delicate strands of saffron then fry to release all the aromatic flavors next add tomato puree chunks and sweet potato and the juicy Brown lamb for a sweet note add plump raisins then cover with stock and simply leave to simmer for a couple of hours delicious eaten straight away but over time the flavors will develop and improve when you're ready to serve simply finish with fresh parsley minimal preparation and ready when you want it fantastic Moroccan Lamb with sweet potato and raisin my next super simple dish that just gets better and better with time is chili chicken with ginger and coriander [Music] by chopping chicken thighs into pieces now on with the marinade chopped garlic Ginger red chili and lemon juice [Music] in a pan toast coriander and cumin seeds to release their flavors grind and add to the chicken [Music] then pour over plain yogurt add turmeric and seasoning mix and leave to marinade from two hours

remaining marinade and cook until tender finally top with coriander marinated for flavor and cooked in 20 minutes chili chicken with ginger and coriander a simple stress-free wander having a delicious sauce on hand to serve with simply cooked fish or meat is a brilliant stress Buster my final recipe is sweet pepper sauce with grilled prawns [Music] for the sauce in hot olive oil fried chopped garlic and diced bread [Music] and put them in a blender [Music] add chopped tomatoes [Music] blister the skin of red peppers under a Hot Grill intensifying the flavor leave to cool then they're easy to peel chop and add Blitz add smoked paprika chili flakes and roughly chopped almonds squeeze of lemon and a dash of Sherry vinegar season Blitz again and add olive oil this sauce keeps really well in the fridge and will intensify in flavor I love it with simple King prawns just add olive oil and Gretel for two minutes on each side [Music] sweet pepper sauce with grilled prawns Simply Delicious [Music] made in advance ready when you want them three stunning simple recipes that take the stress out of the kitchen beautiful this is my ultimate cookery course 100 recipes to stay your life on I'll be showing you an amazing spicy Chutney that's brilliant for transforming the simplest of suppers they don't actually smell much but the flavor they give off is extraordinary but first five more of my 100 tips to make your home cooking easier kicking off with how to skin and debone a fish the hassle-free way interestingly Affiliated side of salmon it's been taken off the bone and now skin off pick up your knife a really nice broad flexible knife a little sharpen lift up the base of the towel and then just Nick a little bit at the end there twist the knife almost as if it's horizontally underneath the salmon cool the skin and you slice the salmon underneath and let the knife do the work now get your skin flip it back over and check you're not leaving too much salmon on top of the skin pull it back and nice and slowly get the skin wrap around your fingers pull the salmon towards you and then just all the way through lay that down one nicely skinned salmon just like a perfect snake skin get your knife and just run the Knife Down and then the pair of tweezers these are fish tweezers but you can use normal tweezers look for the head up and Pull and with the skin being removed from underneath the salmon the pin Bones come out a lot easier and the pinballs only go to just basically halfway along the fillet one nice fillet of salmon beautiful there's still plenty of flavor in the trimmings from Affiliated fish my tip is don't waste those fish bones add to water wine a bay leaf and some chopped veg to make a simple but versatile fish stock at home the perfect base for a delicious fish soup [Music] a great tip for intensely flavored stress-free veg is to steam them in their own juices simply add to a pan with a knob of butter and seasoning then cook on a low heat with a lid on to lock in the moisture [Music] for crispy roast potatoes you can depend on my tip is to parball them leave them to steam dry then sprinkle them with semolina or flour and give them a good roughing up this ensures they go really crispy in the oven a great tip for Browning meat or fish is to drive with kitchen roll before you cook it then you'll get a much better color too much moisture makes the meat steam instead of sear and you'll lose that rich brown crust like the one I got on those sticky pork ribs foreign taking the stress out of cooking is to anticipate the really busy times when you'll need things to hand that are already made my next recipe can be kept on tap in the fridge for weeks on end and is guaranteed to liven up any quick meal spicy chutney with Chutney standing by in the fridge you can always add that special little touch to a simple supper prove that thinking ahead always pays off pan on to start toasting those spices keep the pan nice and low cumin very aromatic very fragrant and it's almost like a light spice next little coriander seeds coriandering now you're going to get a bit of heat in the Chutney mustard seeds well smaller than coriander seeds but so much more powerful mustard seeds in now Curry leaves they don't actually smell much dry but the flavor they give off is extraordinary code is in really important not to burn them otherwise you'll have that bitter taste across the Chutney keep the gas nice and low the secret is sort of toasting them so it releases that oil and intensifies the spice Touch of salt and then a couple of small powerful chilies keep them whole no one's going to eat them but it gives that real nice burst of heat now let them toast gently there we're not going to chop the onion we're going to grate it why because it sort of breaks down to a really nice puree in the Chutney when you grate it hold the root in the palm of your hand and just push nice long straight I want those nice long shards look I've almost got a nice sort of onion puree but it's nice and clear Touch of olive oil spices nicely toasted onions in [Music] three nice cloves of garlic crush them [Music] lay it nice and flat and just slice the garlic nice thin slices garlic in taking your time to get the owners caramelized beautifully will really reap rewards in the long run Tamarind place and sugar in with the sugar first three nice tablespoons of sugar that will give a really nice syrup effect a sort of nice rich syrupy texture to the chutney Tamarind paste you can get Tamarind paste in most delis and the big supermarkets it's really nice thickening agent but it gives that tartness a Chutney and its sort of bridge sugary spicy next in with my coconut add four nice tablespoons that will give a nice body a really nice texture to the Chutney cut that coconut out and now add the carrot grated the carrot just gives the Chutney a really nice sort of punch but also helps to sort of cool down the spice carrots in the water comes out of the carrot flavors the Chutney beautifully but gives that nice sort of vibrant bright color to it as well and grating it almost sort of it Cooks instantly but I want a bit of texture through here turn down the gas and just let that simmer for five minutes because the cars are that moist and juicy then put a couple of tablespoons of water in there to help it along now let's cook that out for five minutes just so those carrots start going nice and soft don't overcook them you want that nice texture in there slightly spicy slightly sweet gas off keep those chilies in there for that it's beautiful nice and gooey delicious and ready to go in his jar because that sits in the fridge just gets better and better and better I love to eat this chutney with cold meats or even cold fish but with ham it's amazing it's a really nice way of livening up the ham just sort of roll it up spoon of chutney I mean it looks fantastic Chutney onto the plate serve and that is a nice little gem in the fridge that is worth prepping in advance for cookery course crammed with key lessons top tips and 100 recipes to stay your life on and you'll literally be cooking yourself

quite nostalgic about a bald egg it's something that's never lost it's magic when you slice that top off and dunk that Soldier into the yolk you can't mess with a deliciously runny yolk but this is what I like to dunk in it an anchovy Soldier anchovies interperson water no salt naturally yeah anchovies are very salty so just a touch of pepper rich in Omega-3s the amazing tinned anchovy is a natural flavor enhancer and I use it to Pepper many a Savory dish from roast lamb to the humble toasted Soldier grind them it's a really nice smooth paste the smell of that is almost like being on the seaside now get your soft butter I just put half the butter in first 50 50 is the way 50 anchovy 50 butter that way you've got that real nice salty creaminess mix that up it's absolutely delicious trust me finishing that anchovy butter on a slice of grilled fish I'm in heaven the bread this is a Sourdough delicious very crusty take four nice slices now get that pan nice and hot a couple of tablespoons of that anchovy oil into the pan and then get your bread and lightly fry each side the smell and the anchovy oil is incredible take that out now bring your water up to the boil The Secret of softly boiling an egg is to place them into the water gently on a spoon in and just tilt so they don't hit the bottom nice and Light up to the ball count to five turn the gas down is it four and a half minutes is it five minutes for soft boiled egg I've cooked thousands of them and every time four and a half minutes whilst that's boiling get your bread spread that on there that is incredible chopped parsley brings that kind of freshness goes brilliantly well with the anchovies feel that crunch on inside but I can't resist oh my God right gas off one Beauty in two I feel like a five-year-old again this is that moment when you open the vault and that little magic inside is all yours there's a great Twist on a great classic wow [Music] perfectly soft boiled eggs with dressed up anchovy butter soldiers i've smoked haddock and spinach baked eggs spoke haddock one of my favorite fish delicious highly sustainable it's packed with protein lightly smoked there's not a Dye smoke there's a big difference so you haven't got that bright yellow tinge so much better next baby spinach there's a spinach that's very young full of zinc great flavor a little teaspoon volleyball knob of butter that little touch of oil stops the butter from burning it looks like a lot of spinach I was going to disintegrate almost by two-thirds I'm cooking spinach and butter open up the top of my pepper Mills so the pepper becomes almost like so Cracked Pepper not so fine once your spinach has reduced down by two-thirds add in your cubes of smoked haddock it's got that nice vinegary flavor quite tart pick off the little buds from the stalks keep hold of these and grateful when you're making a target of vinegar red wine vinegar tag and stalks in chop the target into your creme fraiche little season now grain mustard goes brilliantly well with haddock incredible this mustardy Herby creme fresh will work equally well partnered with grilled chicken the haddock's starting to flake because it's smoked lightly cured it Cooks so quickly you creme fresh now it's almost like the beginning of the perfect fish pie but as opposed to putting pastry on top the eggs are going to bake on top so you've got this wonderful egg crust turn the gas off now crack your eggs around the outside just a little twist of pepper get the remainder of your creme fresh and put a little dollop in between that adds richness to the egg whites into the oven at 180. for 10 to 12 minutes [Music] whilst the haddock and eggs baked together I can knock up a simple spring onion garnish in professional kitchen chefs refuse to use the top of the spring onions but I love that nice dark green flavor it says harsh and the white the smell of baked mustard you can't beat [Music] that is beautiful spinach has almost melted in with a had it now just sprinkle your spring onions that gives that really nice sharpness My ultimate hearty breakfast smoked haddock and spinach baked eggs so packed with protein and iron you'll be raring to dive into the day ahead [Music] of eggs benedict with Crispy Parma ham the secret behind a great egg Benedict is in the hollandaise so get your pan on because I'm going to cook a hollandaise over a rolling boil with a glass bowl butter just put it on to melt three egg yolks separated from the white targon vinegar pop that into the eggs if you can't get tarot and vinegar any white wine vinegar will do just as long as you've got that acidity in there give some bite to the hollandaise put your bowl over the Rolling Water and just start whisking if the eggs had Direct contact with the gas pollen days will become scrambled egg once you've got that nice creamy texture a nice thick Sauvignon start adding your butter nice and slowly a couple of tablespoons of butter in and give that a really nice mix if you don't whisk it enough the egg yolks don't take the butter it causes it to split it's more butter using a big balloon whisk like this one makes it easier to incorporate air and helps prevent your mixture from separating all the butter in the best way to keep hollandaise nice and warm is just leave it to sit over that nice warm water bath and it just gives it a really nice room temperature a nice pinch of salt fresh pepper and then face lemon juice that just really makes it vibrant exciting and you want it like a sort of thick custard I just want it to coat the back of the spoon so it's like you're giving the a nice glossy texture to your beautiful poached egg now as the base for the eggs benedict you cannot beat English muffins but the ham I'm Gonna Change I'm going to use the most amazing Parma ham get your pan nice and hot into the pan it's like Posh rashes of bacon beautiful [Music] ham fried nice and crisp like that is incredible beautifully salads fantastic for eggs Benedict [Music] now keep that pan nice and hot I want all that flavor on the Parma ham left in there and rather than toast my muffins I want to put the muffins into the pan I want them sucking up all that wonderful flavor from that crispy Parma ham make sure your muffins are toasted nicely this will prevent them going soggy later look at that nice and crisp that water on to boil for the eggs nicely seasoned really important and then just a little splash of vinegar in the water that helps to set the egg white in a minute you crack it in while the water heats up in the pan there's time to get organized lay a nice slice of ham on the base now water's brought up to the ball turn it down and then spin your water around like a little whirlpool and get a little cup so you just drop the cup in gets caught up in the turbulence of the water the secret is not to boil the water rapidly because the strength of the ball can literally explode your egg as they start to move the way up to the top of the water that's a indication that they're cooked take off any excess little bits of egg white and then out onto a piece of tissue paper that just drains off excess water and it stops your muffin from going really soggy but look they're like little beautiful mozzarella balls give them a little season lift them on to a crispy Parma ham peaceful now get a nice spoon of your Hollandaise glaze over try and do it in one glazing over the whole egg when I tell Jack Holly and Megan I'm Matilda that we're cooking eggs benedict for breakfast they bolt down the stairs and let's be honest who wouldn't run to sit in front of those [Music] a special occasion breakfast that would make anyone feel spoiled eggs benedict with Crispy Parma ham foreign

served with Rich and delicious Welsh rare bit look at those babies that just takes cheese and toast to another level and my youngest daughter Tilly joins me making beef and Ale stew with mustard dumplings and that's the only way I want you to taste beer followed by a scrumptious pear and Ginger galette three delicious full-bodied comforting meals breakfast lunch and dinner starting with a hearty breakfast of smoked haddock and spinach baked eggs this boat haddock one of my favorite fish delicious highly sustainable it's packed with protein lightly smoked there's not a Dye smoke there's a big difference see I've got that bright yellow tinge so much better next baby spinach there's a spinach that's very young full of zinc great flavor a little teaspoon volleyball knob of butter that little touch of oil stops the butter from burning it looks like a lot of spinach but it's going to disintegrate almost by two-thirds when I'm cooking spinach and butter open up the top of my pepper Mills so the pepper becomes almost like so Cracked Pepper not so fine once your spinach has reduced down by two-thirds add in your cubes of smoked haddock tag them it's got that nice vinegary flavor quite tart pick off the little buds from the stalks keep all of these and grateful when you're making a tag of vinegar red wine vinegar tag and stalks in chop the target into your creme fraiche little season now grain mustard goes brilliantly well with haddock incredible this mustardy Herby creme fresh will work equally well partnered with grilled chicken the haddock's starting to flake because it's smoked lightly cured it Cooks so quickly you creme fresh now it's almost like the beginning of the perfect fish pie but as opposed to putting pastry on top the eggs are going to bake on top so you've got this wonderful egg crust turn the gas off now crack your eggs around the outside just a little twist of pepper get the remainder of your creme fresh and put a little dollop in between that adds richness to the egg whites into the oven at 180 for 10 to 12 minutes [Music] what's the haddock and eggs baked together I can knock up a simple spring onion garnish in professional kitchen chefs refuse to use the top of the spring onions but I love that nice dark green flavor it says harsh than the white the smell of baked mustard you can't beat [Music] that is beautiful spinach has almost melted in with a had it now just sprinkle your spring onions that gives that really nice sharpness My ultimate hearty breakfast smoked haddock and spinach baked eggs so packed with protein and iron you'll be raring to dive into the day ahead [Music] for my ultimate hearty lunch and dinner you need some hearty ingredients here's a more in-depth look at some of the key ones you'll need to buy made from roasted malt hops water and yeast Stout Porter was the preferred Bevy of London's River Porters in the 18th century but this bridge bitter tasting beer is linked with food goes way back too not only is it the perfect hearty Tipple to wash down a couple of oysters it works its magic in soups stews pies and cakes too thank you so it's a classic English ingredient since the Middle Ages half waxy fat is taken from around the kidneys and loins of beef or mutton today so it is still prized for imparting a unique lightness and Rich but subtle flavor to Savory and sweet steamed puddings and today I'll be rolling up traditional mustard suet dumplings to hearty up a slow-cooked beef stew [Music] Ginger a zingy and versatile medicinal and culinary heavyweight used powdered it adds punch to cakes biscuits and beer crystallized is eaten as lip smacking sweet meat and the fresh or pickled fibers root adds vibrant heat to dishes the length and breadth of Asia I'll be using a triple Ginger measure to give depth and spice to wonderful classic pear and Ginger galette [Music] when it comes to my ultimate hearty lunch it's got to be soup soups can be light and delicate or Rich and gutsy they're versatile practical and easy to make and for my ultimate hearty lunch I'm making one of my childhood favorites roasted tomato soup beautiful Vine Tomatoes The Ripe in the tomatoes the better the soup take the core out get your thumb and place it half a centimeter underneath the tip of your knife place it in and then just twist around that's the only part of the Tomato that we're not using red onion and garlic Red Onion because it's sweeter than a white onion slice your onions and your garlic nice and fine traditionally we make it in a pot it's so much better to start it off on top of the stove searing the tomatoes and the garlic but it goes in the oven you actually roast the tomatoes and they don't stew there's a big difference in flavor be quite generous with the olive oil it makes the soup nice and glossy shiny salt pepper and then a little teaspoon of cayenne just gives it that heat but it's not as Fierce as chili take your Tomatoes just slice them in half and then a little touch of sugar that's gonna help intensify the sweetness a little sprinkle of aged off with vinegar gives that nice dark Rich acidity to the soup into the oven 20 25 minutes 180. to make my soup even more irresistible I'm going to make a Punchy sun-dried tomato pesto to drizzle over the top now I'm making this in a pestle and mortar because you feel so much more in control and you're not depending on a blade that's whizzing around a thousand miles an hour next in a dry pan toast off some pine nuts toast them the absolute Max and then in smelling those incredible parmesan slightly grate that this is where it starts to become creamy extra virgin olive oil doesn't need salt because the parmesan is going to season it for you and just take a couple of tablespoons of the oil the sun-dried tomatoes are in really helps to make that stunning pesto I can smell those roasted tomatoes I want them out wow next pour in a little vegetable stock or chicken stock so it sits halfway up the tomatoes put your spoon through those Tomatoes they break up instantly bring that up to the boil let it simmer for three or four minutes I want to make a little bit more creaming out creaming give that a little stir you can keep it rustic and get your Masher in and you've got that nice thick Rich Chunky Tomato Soup or give yourself a stick blender [Music] blitzing it like that you deglaze the bottom of the pan and you get all those amazing flavors from the bottom um that's delicious to make my lunch extra hearty I'm going to knock up a deliciously gutsy version of cheese on toast to go with my tomato soup watch Rabbit an absolute classic I'm gonna make a roux 50 pounds of butter three nice tablespoons of flour and that's all the roux is basically traditionally you would use flour butter and milk but in Welsh rabbit the milk is often cheekily substituted for a stiff slug of stout it gives it that strong gutsy flavor I want it nice and thick make sure those lumps are out a nice teaspoon of Dijon mustard and then season it nice and spicy with Worcestershire sauce gives it that delicious intriguing Flavor now that smells amazing almost brings tears to your eyes beautiful now whilst rabbit wouldn't be a stunning Welsh rabbit without Rich mature cheese so I'm a great Montgomery cheddar goes well with the beer and drop that in really important to put this in by the roux still nice and hot because the cheese melts now for the bread I prefer a good rustic country loaf that will stand up to my hardcore topping I want that nice crisp base to my Welsh rabbit so toast it both sides [Music] spread that beautiful cheesy Berry spicy mixture just great got a blister and bubble and gratinate God a little splash alien Perry and back under the grill for 90 seconds in one delicious creamy roasted tomato soup it's coming back to me all those days I had off school I used to purposely lie about feeling ill just to get a bowl of my mother's tomato soup how bad was that but my God it was worth it oh now my Welsh rabbit look at those babies that just takes cheese on toast to another level wow roasted creamy tomato soup with a sun-dried tomato pesto served with the most amazing delicious Welsh rabbit I feel like bringing in sick [Music] some of the best hearty dinners I can think of are slow cooked recipes made with robust deep flavored ingredients and left to Bubble away for hours until they become glossly rich this is the sort of food that really gives you plenty of energy and protects you against cold winter weather so for my ultimate Hearty dinner I'm doing a dish that every home cook should have a recipe for a great stick to your ribs stew here's my favorite beef and Ale with mustard dumplings foreign [Music] first things first I'd like you to season the students day a nice spoon of flour mix yeah good girl what's the flower going to do dad the flower helps to Brown the beef seasoned flour will also help to add flavor and thicken the stew I feel a bit like marshmallows you do feel a little bit marshmallow don't they look at the size of the chunks of the beef I'm gonna cut my carrots literally similar similar sizes right does that mean they'll cook equally that's right now these they're little pearl onions I'm going to put them in whole as well everything has to stay the same otherwise it could burn oh we've seen burn garlic before Oh Matilda I should probably mention that what is that time time and what they Bailey's Bailey's good girl tablespoon of oil in the beef goes in first okay in now really nice color it's a beautiful color remember the carrots thyme in good girl garlic pearl onions in good give that a really good mix up [Music] shoes are very easy to make providing at the beginning you give it a little bit of love now that's all juicy browned that bear that is beer and that's going to deglaze the pan adding beer or Stout helps to tenderize the beef and give it a hearty delicious flavor and that's the only way I want you to taste beer in a stew yeah I'm going to add in a couple of teaspoons of tomato puree please in fact three please because it's so nice and there's one final thing in there cover this tuna steak with a big stock give that a little mix with Daddy please wow that's really nice it's not even cooked yet do you keep all these vegetables in when you start um serve it oh yes is the Garlic going to be burnt no excuse me right the wheels put the lid with a little bit just a little bit so it can be trying to not make the stew or watery into the oven at 150 please tell us for about two and a half hours and now getting focused on your homework time to knock up two delicious hearty potato Classics in one twice baked bubble and sweet jacket potatoes start by baking large potatoes in a preheated oven at 180 degrees we shred one third of your savoy cabbage and saute and butter and add a dash of water until tender after about half an hour your potatoes should be crisp on the outside and cooked through in the middle slice them in half and scoop out the soft potato Center then Mash with a couple of knobs of butter or mix in the cabbage and season to taste spoon this mixture back into your potato shells and into the oven for a further 10 minutes or until the tops are nice and crispy and golden two delicious hearty potato Classics in one twice baked bubbling squeak jacket potatoes right homework done yeah mysterious chewing stewing let's get on with our delicious hearty pet tart I've been looking forward to this you and I Chef I'm gonna prep the pears so if you peel I'll top and tell into quarters pears go soft in the oven very very quickly so we're going to put them on a tart we'll need to leave them whole half or in quarter what's that in there Ginger that's right a stem Ginger so when you use stem Ginger and fresh ginger next add your stem Ginger a little of the stem ginger syrup good girl and some brown sugar to your quartered pears and then just grate some fresh ginger off you go so it's a bit of a different one to grate this because it doesn't really come through like the cheese no I'm gonna make that a little bit zesty now we've got some lemons some lemon zest in there right what we need to do now is give that a nice little mix now this is a sweet pastry you can buy this stuff we can make it so easy to do so give me your finger that's my center point I want you to get the pears going around like that in a really nice Circle it's difficult isn't it because the pairs keep on sliding all over the place yeah so egg wash the outside and I'm going to show you a little trick so you lift that up so see egg wash acting like a bit of a glue that's right crimple this but pastry form this nice little shelf like a little money bag are you going to do anything with the spare pairs oh yeah you start building that up then you see we've got the fresh ginger and those nice little bits of stem Ginger let me go around Mike with your glue we might glow just on top Tilly's last job is to give our tart a good dusting of icing sugar so that caramelizes it and colors the pears beautifully it's a bit like snow isn't it now that glazes the pastry so the pastry has this really nice shine on there as well finally the lemon on top put that there 180 and in she goes can you smell the beef [Music] wow it's even gone down a bit more hasn't it okay I want you to just I was hoping you'd asked taste [Music] how's that taste now you're not allowed anymore all right dumpling time flowering please I'm using self-raising flour for a fluffy result but if you like your dumplings hard

perfect morning treat for vegetarians and carnivores alike pear and crunchy granola muffins something quite nice when you walk into friends or family's house and you smell a muffin bean bags the flour and the baking powder in a nice touch of cinnamon cinnamon muffins goes brilliantly pinch of salt that's really important for the sort of overall flavor you don't want the muffin to be too sweet muscovado sugar that's a refined brown sugar really rich and somewhat spicy it goes brilliantly inside the muffin and then my crispy granola so now we're gonna put half of this in now and save the other half to sprinkle on top of the muffin give that a really good mix in the center I have some fresh pear top and tail of the pears really important to peel nothing worse when you're trying to enjoy that muffin and you're negotiating with a big sliver skin of pear slice them around the core sides a slice them nice and thinly generally muffins contain around half the fat and sugar of cupcakes once the dry ingredients are mixed together you add in the wet two whole eggs nice milk in followed by gently melted butter give that a good mix [Music] add that to your mixture start folding always do it by hand muffins are delicate dainty little beasts don't overwork your muffin mixture you want that mixture to become nice and relaxed now the mix looks nice and creamy you'll try and your little cups and Spoon in that mixture two-thirds full one nice generous spoon and you can tell the mix is right because you've got that even distribution of the pear running from the top to the bottom just gently tap your tray both ends that gets the mix all the way down so they cook nice and evenly take your granola now sprinkle that on top so you've got this dual texture spicy pear and this nice crunchy topping makes the muffin taste and feel a little bit more luxurious now into the oven at 180 for 25 minutes uses they smell delicious got that nice crispy top just get them out and let them cool down and I don't have any problems turning vegetarian once or twice a week when I'm having muffins like that nice smell amazing [Music] a vegetarian breakfast to put hairs on your chest pear and crunchy granola muffins that is a Vegetarian Delight beautiful [Music] coming up I'll be showing you a stunning vegetarian lunch and dinner but first here's a more in-depth look at the key ingredients you'll need for them first for dinner I'm using risotto rice risotto is a flagship classic in Italian cuisine but is widely believed that the Spaniards introduced it to Northern Italy back in the Middle Ages there are three main types Arborio kanaroli and violoni their ability to absorb liquid and flavor whilst releasing lots of starch is what makes risotto uniquely delicious and anxious a tasty creamy and inexpensive way to satisfy lots of tummies without a morsel of meat in sight [Music] the Deep dramatic red color of sweet earthy beetroot makes it difficult to outdo in terms of all-round culinary impact but early forms of this humble room veg were carrot shapes and favored for their medicinal rather than their cooking merits today there is a veritable rainbow of beetroot types to be enjoyed pickled in soups grated into cakes or even simply roasted which is how we're using mine in my amazing vegetarian main course risotto halloumi is a firm springy salty cheese with its roots firmly in Cyprus and Greece the better Lumi is made from sheep's milk rich in vitamins and essential nutrients is thought to promote longevity halloumi keeps for many months if stored unopened in the fridge and its high melting point makes it brilliantly adaptable perfect for grilling barbecue and frying I'll be championing this texture lending Marvel for my yummy vegetarian lunch dish of halloumi courgette and Herb Cakes [Music] as a chef I'm never sniffy about cooking with vegetables because I know that with a bit of care and attention they can be turned into something absolutely stunning for my ultimate vegetarian lunch I've got a couple of fantastic recipes lightly fried my delicious halloumian courgette cakes squeeze every last bit of flavor out of those vegetables but first i'm preparing a simple slow roast tomato and Watercress salad these cherry tomatoes are perfect if you haven't got cherry tomatoes vegetable or even just big normal plum tomatoes lay the tomatoes on the tray and these go into the oven for about 90 minutes if you turn the oven down really low you can leave them in overnight to be honest the longer you leave them the better they taste once you've seasoned them with salt sprinkle over with some sugar on the salt and sugar combined speeds up the drying process because you want that nice chewy texture and then you get these little thyme flowers and just pick off the buds garlic sliced then just spread that on now the tray looks quite full and compact for 90 minutes in the oven you'll see everything shrink down all the Skins blistering and the flavor intensifies so nicely extra virgin olive oil that gives a nice earthy flavor to the tomatoes place your Tomatoes into an oven preheated to 150 degrees C and cook long and slow for an hour and a half now halloumi cakes there's something quite exciting about halloumi cheese it's a very firm cheese and it fries brilliantly [Music] peel the carrots [Music] great not too finely you want that nice texture next courgette the secret is keeping it all grated the same put that into a sieve a sprinkling of salt will draw out liquid from the vegetables then grate the halloumi halloumi cheese doesn't look that tasty but once you've got color on it in the pan it's really really delicious now really important to squeeze out the excess water in the veg and we'll see all that water that needs to come out of there if we didn't do this it'll make your little patties non-friable because the whole thing starts to separate and then mix in with the cheese spring onions chop up the whites and the greens now we're going to season that with some delicious fresh mint and fresh coriander whenever it's vegetarian I like to put a combination of herbs in there tarragon and parsley minted coriander basil and lemongrass all delicious on their own but in tandem their flavors play off each other next two eggs in give that a little mix add the eggs to the mixture and then finally a couple of tablespoons of breadcrumbs the breadcrumbs help dry out any excess moisture mix all the ingredients together before you start shaping these taste the mixture it's really important to identify the seasoning now if you wait until you've cooked them it'll be too late to adjust the seasoning roll them to a large golf ball shape them it's like a little mini burger you can spice these up with some chili in there if you haven't got fresh chili chili flakes and it's something that can be done up a day in advance to get your cakes firm and ready for frying put them into the fridge uncovered for 25 minutes pan on get that nice and hot boss and wait for that I'll get the dressing ready slice of red chili seeds and all on an angle into shards then chop fresh ginger [Music] season with a Sprinkle of sugar and salt add some rice wine vinegar add a couple of tablespoons of olive oil to finish off some chopped coriander [Music] because that's sweet sour spicy flavor with my chili dressing done I can start frying off my halloumi cakes in a hot oiled pan look at that nice crisp Edge you can already start to smell that sauteed halloumi with the courgettes and carrots smells delicious really important for a nice amount of color on them as my cakes Sizzle away I can finish off with my roast tomato salad one of my favorite leaves has to be the Watercress just cut off stalks [Music] slot rings Watercress and shallot go brilliantly well together looks so dainty when you open up these little ringlets [Music] don't forget to turn your cakes now Tomatoes whatever you don't use just jar them and put them in the fridge [Music] just drop those slow cooked warm Tomatoes over the Watercress the sweetness is incredible absolutely delicious a little drizzle of age of ultimate vinegar gives that tartness to the watercress Watercress is naturally peppery so it doesn't need any pepper just a little touch of salt and then a light sprinkling of extra virgin olive oil after five minutes on a medium heat my halloumi cakes are ready so important to have taken out that water [Music] you can see it doesn't disintegrate and then just get your dressing take a spoon of it and then tilt it to the side because I want the garnish I don't want the juice but that does not turn you on to become a vegetarian for the night I honestly don't know what will delicious [Music] my crispy golden halloumi courgette and Herb cakes with a Sumptuous roast tomato and Watercress salad all of the flavor with none of the meat when I was growing up my mum was a very very good cook so we had some great food but it was always meat and two veg and the veg definitely played a bit past but the more attention you pay to cooking vegetables the more you realize they can easily take Center Stage for all the flavor would know In the Flesh here's my ultimate vegetarian dinner first a hearty starter a bruschetta with ricotta and succulent griddle courgettes for my main I'm serving fragrant roasted beetroot and Thyme risotto [Music] but I'll be in trouble with the kids if I don't do it but so I'm enlisting the help of my youngest Tilly to rustle up an indulgent chocolate and lime mousse with crushed raspberries so if you unwrap the chocolate start breaking up in Little Bits we're going to make the most amazing white chocolate mousse our first job is to bring half of our cream up to the boil so what kind of cream is that in there dad that is double cream okay so that's gonna make a really nice rich chocolate mousse what's your favorite sort of chocolate is it white milk dark um I love white and milk what's yours I absolutely love milk chocolate oh my guilty pleasure is it really here we go cream end so that goes in there now you can see what's happening straight away can't you it's melting really quickly melting really quickly so okay oh excuse me at least your Jumper's white so you won't spot it yeah I've got a nice little snap for later in another Bowl add lime zest cold cream and whisk until it forms soft peaks the lime cuts the sort of richness of the cream and that starts to make the chocolate mousse taste a little bit lighter mmm it smells really good the lime gives it a really nice zinginess you're absolutely right next add to the melted chocolate mixture because I'm whisking it's just getting lighter and lighter and lighter have a little taste nice yeah the line gives it a really nice taste Tilly I need the rest for the mousse I need some for my tummy no come on chocolate mousse into the fridge our next job is to separate out three egg whites this is where I need you at your absolute best okay because to whip those whites it's going to be really tough so we'll take it in turns 30 seconds each okay you go first 10 seconds gone come on silly in seconds gone 20 seconds gone come on you can do it 10 seconds to go five four three two one and change excellent hold the ball right no no way [Music] you can't do that to me 30 seconds that's the best way of whipping up egg whites you start tipping that sugar in slowly should go feeling all very happy in there so a contentious whipped egg whites will make our mousse light and Airy and when they've reached soft peaks we can gently mix in our cooled white chocolate and cream mixture once the egg whites hit the cream yep the chocolate sets the egg whites keep the cream nice and fluffy and you get this nice light mousse in the bowl now I need you to crush some raspberries please with some fresh mint you can see all the juice coming out now take your mousse wow that looks really cool now look at that down the bottom it's a crushed raspberry delicious now I'm going to set that in the fridge if you use the can I open the door please our yummy white chocolate mousse will take at least two hours to set so we can crack on with our Mediterranean inspired vegetarian starter griddle courgette Ricotta and mint bruschetta for this recipe you'll need a griddle pan an essential piece of kit for that char grill look cut thick slices of chapata bread drizzle both sides with olive oil [Music] season with a little salt and pepper and griddle each side until toasted then slice a couple of courgettes diagonally into half a centimeter thick pieces drizzle and coat in olive oil and season with salt and pepper sear on a smoking hot griddle pan in batches until all the courgettes are bar marked on both sides next roughly chop mint leaves and combine with creamy ricotta cheese spread your toasty to your pattern with dollops of minty Ricotta and top with your seared courgette super simple and super tasty now we're going to make a delicious beetroot risotto we need to get the shallots just slice them in half and then just chop them like that okay okay now have you ever made a risotto shallots please into the pan for Daddy add a Sprinkle of salt and pepper along with a couple of crushed cloves of garlic once you start cooking the risotto it's really important to have your stock gently boiling away if we're adding cold stock on top of the rice all the time it just slows down the process generally you cook a nice wide flat pan if you're cooking a deep pan all the rice

apple crumble crumbles are the perfect way to use fruit when it's in season there's lots of it about it's nice and cheap but most importantly the fruits at its absolute best [Music] first off I'm going to make a really nice light caramel pan on nice and low great two apples [Music] this helps to almost sort of pure the Apple so much quicker there's a lot of flavor in the skin so don't worry about peeling the fruit whether it's pears plums peaches flavors in the skin [Music] start the camera a couple of tablespoons of sugar the sugar helps to get rid of the tartness in the Apple a touch cinnamon that starts to make it a little spicy open up your vanilla and just scrape out all those seeds now this just makes it light and fragrant all those seeds in to the Sugar We're making caramel be patient and always swirl the dish instead of stirring it when the sugar goes Brown add the Apple starts to sort of cool down the caramel but it gives it a really nice sort of caramelized puree apples almost disintegrating smells incredible and the gas down slice up two apples it's a crumble That's Got No Frills straightforward they're faffing around no peeling on the skin I want them to sort of stand out from the camera apples in now there's nice thick chunks of Apple sort of almost bedding itself into the puree dried cranberries gives it that nice sort of shock in the texture sweet chewy I want it to sort of taste zesty spicy so sit the lemon zest on top of your apples and cranberry fresh lemon juice over and that just gives that extra acidic kick takes the Cranberries the apples the caramel and the cinnamon to another level turn the gas off that says let's concentrate on the crumble flowering a couple of tablespoons of Demerol sugar sugar helps to get the topping nice and crispy batter in give that a nice little rub what we're looking for is like a breadcrumb mixture lightly season it with a touch of cinnamon and the dimmer our sugar sort of helps to get a nice fine crumble mix and it stops the butter from sort of melting in that flour so that's the basic crumble mix but I'm not finished yet muesli two-thirds crumble one third muesli mix that in if you haven't got muesli then crunchy granola works brilliantly too lovely now start off in the center and work your way around I want the crispiness on the top the puree on the bottom of the caramel and then the texture in the center a good tip turn the gas back on I want it bubbling before it goes in the oven because then you just got to cook the top so as soon as you see that caramel starting to Bubble down the side in she goes let's go all right bake it 200 degrees Celsius for 12 to 14 minutes until golden brown smells amazing [Music] still bubbling and look at it a delicious but very simple crumble with apples at their absolute best beautiful and on for the stuffing it's a saddle of lamb basically a sort of Rolls-Royce cut perfectly shaped and it suits stuffing to an absolute tea but the stuffing finely chop an onion garlic nice thin slices oil in onions and garlic in [Music] salt and pepper make sure the stuffing is beautifully seasoned so it helps to season the inside of the lamb now we've got the color on those onions I'm going to throw in some pine nuts that helps to give a bit of a texture here's where it starts getting really exciting spinach in and just lay the spinach over the pine nuts it looks like a lot of spinach that's going to condense and disappear almost instantly it's more flavors finish when you saute it as opposed to steaming it or boiling it gas off look at that now to bring that together no eggs no bread crumbs crumpled feta over the spinach feta cheese adds a beautifully salty sharp and creamy flavor what this does it brings that stuffing together now open up the lamb keep those little fillets to the side that's the channel that we want to stuff so I want to just open that up a little bit there salt and pepper lightly if you forward stuffing in we're going to season it with Sumo sumac is a wonderful lemony spice that goes brilliantly with lamb and you can get it in most big supermarkets and I sort of cuts through that thick Rich sweetness of the Lamb open up that lamb there take a spoon if you're preparing this for the day ahead then let the stuffing cool down it's inevitable when you start rolling it and tying it someone's going to squeeze out so load up the ends take these Beauties these little fillets and just support that stuffing and sort of increase that beautiful tunnel and then from there over there and bring that towards you and then roll like I said some of the stuff is going to come out now just tie it first off around the side and don't worry about some flash which is not just tie it one in the middle you can get butcher string from your local butcher or at cookware shops I got two ties go too tight it just forces all that stuffing out of the Lamb when it's in the oven nice now I want to season the top of it roll the joint to make sure all the skin gets seasoned now you think normally that just goes in the oven like that that's how my mum would do it but get your tray onto the gas oil in get it really nicely colored none of your stuffing's coming out of the sides really important look at that color beautiful does kick start the roasting process gas off into the oven cook for 45 to 55 minutes depending on how pink you want your lamb [Music] the lamb out of the fat to rest resting it raised up in the tin will stop it cooking but not cool it down too quickly and means you won't lose any of those lovely juices next I'm making a simple but sophisticated accompaniment for the lamb top and tell the Cucumber peel it cut the Cucumber into three and just core take out all that it's just sort of watery seedium it spoils the flavor sliced cucumber cucumber in really nice way of making a cheap and cheerful cucumber look glamorous we're going to dress that cucumber with a nice fresh yogurt a couple of tablespoons next some fresh mint dressing Touch of salt Touch of pepper and then pomegranate molasses that just swings it up finish that with lemon mix that up it's rested carefully take off the string and then just gently pull them back the straight edge knife is going to cut through that crispy fat on the outside instantly I tied it purposely so I can guess my portion control from the lines hold it nice and firmly look at your line where the string was and look and this one is going to be amazing lay and down just in those two slices there it proves that stuffing Meats is for special occasions because that is a saddle of lamb at its absolute best stuffing meats and fish not only makes them look fantastic it also gives them an extra added flavor Dimension too once you've mastered the technique you'll be able to turn out dishes that will guarantee you'll have an unforgettable feast foreign

cooking for crowds is creating the atmosphere and that buzz getting your guests to sort of almost get involved and dip in and dip out this is an exciting fragrant wrap that is so easy to do first off soak the noodles these are thin glass noodles basically bring the kettle up to the boil and just pour just let them steep there for a couple of minutes the noodles are for my prawn rolls as they soak I'm gonna make a spicy dipping sauce to go with them start off with sugar we're trying to create that sweet sour salty but a really nice sort of heated sauce as well rice wine vinegar that will dissolve the sugar fish sauce now that's going to give it its saltiness next the chili I want the seeds left in because I want some power chili in a little bit of garlic don't need to chop it too

there there's no cream there's no butter it's just a really nice light dipping sauce and wow all those senses going on now I'm gonna make the filling for the wraps a really nice fresh noodle salad rinse the noodles in cold water then chop them into bite-sized lengths prawns peeled and cooked slice them up the prawns give a really nice sweetness next the vegetables I want crunch freshness texture baby gem lettuce and just shred that lettuce next spring onion the good news about these wraps is that you can make them up in advance sit them in the fridge and then take them out literally seconds before you guess arrive kill the cat so you've got a really nice fresh crunchy carrot now fresh mint fresh basil and fresh coriander together it sounds a little bit bizarre but it tastes amazing don't hold back with the herbs they'll really help make the filling vibrant fresh and aromatic finally touch a lime squeeze that fresh lime juice over there a couple of tablespoons of your dipping sauce don't put too much in there it just makes all the filling too wet just give that a really good mix that's a very quick simple salad to eat now but let's get it into a wrap now take your rice paper wrap literally 30 seconds in warm water you can get rice paper wraps from your local Asian supermarket or buy them online gently lift it out of the water there beautiful lay it carefully onto your board [Music] place the mixture the bottom don't overfill it could be a nightmare to roll them over first nice and tightly halfway then tuck in the ends make sure nothing's coming out the

your scissors trim the edge almost we've got a bit of a sort of sharp point bring your three figs together and just thread the top of each fig nice and gently rosemary works wonderfully with sweet

caramel four or five tablespoons of sugar now flatten that out and get it nice and even when the sugar is even caramel cooks evenly it's changing now you can see it melting from the outside in the one thing you don't do is shake the pan rapidly and see it almost like sort of a lake defrosting and it's hitting to the center bubbling still not dark enough yet it's getting there turn the gas down and

nice scraping of orange zest orange liqueur don't whisk that in fold it in and that stops the cream from separating lovely now take that out of the bowl and put it into a piping bag unwrap over your

of olive oil in pan nice and hot hold up the steak and lay it in always lay away through the panna a little shake and it stops the steak from sticking we're looking for color and if it sticks it's gonna burn while the steaks are cooking i can get on with my super quick marinade now two tablespoons of meat soup paste that's a fermented soybean that gives a really nice sort of rich sweetness tablespoon of sugar a couple of tablespoons rice wine that gives it a really nice vinegary kick a couple tablespoons of olive oil salt and pepper i'm looking for a nice sort of thick rich marinade marinade done it's time to turn the steaks sort the pan and to give the steaks a little base all we're doing every time is just adding more more flavor take your tongs and sort of lift the steak on its back and really melt all that fat down off of the gas take them out just take your knife see all that fat there just slice that off i don't want any of that now in to the marinade [Music] useful tacos are one of mexico's most popular street foods they've been made from beef pork chicken or fish and are loaded up with amazing sauces and spices now i want something sort of pickly cabbage these are um chinese cabbages slice it in half and look at it really crisp and really tasty we're going to slice that into quarters and then just shred it and take your time you think of cabbage here and you think of sort of braised overcooked cabbage nothing worse but attacker you want freshness a little season of chili flakes they sort of discreetly give it a little bit of heat a little touch of rice wine vinegar if you haven't got that fresh lemon juice a small drop of toasted sesame seed oil give that a really good mix now i need something to sort of bring it together we take some wasabi paste very hot very spicy a sort of thumbnail size i'm gonna mix that with a couple of tablespoons of mayonnaise and give that a really good mix these are basic corn tortilla the trick is to sort of color them and then shape them actually place it on the gas ring use some tongs so it's not to burn yourself you can also toast your tacos in a frying pan from there i'm just gonna place it on the rolling pin literally 30 seconds as it cools down the great thing about serving tacos is people can fill them themselves just the way they want them cabbage just squeeze out wet marinade a nice rustic little mountain mayonnaise on wait you see how soft and delicious and almost sort of melting in the mouth texture we've got on this amazing sirloin it's got that really nice sear around the outside it's just nice and pink in the middle start off with my crispy shell back of the spoon with the wasabi mayonnaise inside taco and just sprinkle that delicious pickled cabbage and then just start lining my taco three or four slices touch more on my spicy layer and that is how i'd make the perfect taco [Music] this is like a triple omelette but a lot more ingredients than a normal mesh we'll start off with some lovely smoked bacon slice the bacon bacon in those salts little touch of pepper start off on a high heat get that bacon really nice and crispy otherwise you just boil the bacon and it's got that soft unpleasant texture in the frittata turn down the gas and now start adding your veg roughly chop a red pepper and add it to the pan the peppers and the bacon take the longest so they've always got to go in first now soaking them off the peppers have been cooked now from that sort of rendered fat from the bacon and then the spring onions just bunch them up slice them i want them on an angle so they come like little green diamonds spring onions in now for the eggs cracking the eggs for that size pan seven or eight eggs i want to fill it right to the very top and more importantly when i turn this out i want it like a gato nice and thick so slice through and see all those wonderful verge [Music] i'm gonna season the eggs with some parmesan cheese be quite generous because it adds a really nice saltiness [Music] fresh ground pepper and then whisk whisk up those eggs nicely [Music] then add peas to the pan and to give the dish a wonderful aromatic freshness some fragrant chopped basil i want to chop that sort of roughly because i want to see those flecks of green going in i want it looking charming and how many times have you seen a dull omelet frittatas in my mind really helped encapsulate the magic of having savory eggs cooked beautifully but with texture now just before we add the eggs i've got this beautiful little goat's cheese and it's strong and powerful so i want to slice it into little chunks and then just have it dotted around i want to discover these little pockets of creamy goat's cheese now slowly add the eggs [Music] fill that right up and get your spoon now just let all that egg go down to the bottom bring it back up to the boil and sort of clean around the sides and then some of this delicious salty creamy goat's cheese over the top now i want it melting like a perfect slice of cheese on toast nice now from there turn the grill on for four to five minutes [Music] now just looking at that delicious take a little paring knife and just make sure it's released on the sides just take your panel tap that will hopefully release the frittata from the bottom of the pan now abort over the panel turn that gently and just shake say a little prayer and lift off back beautiful now from there on there it's there look now slice through you can see how soft and creamy that is in the center and that goat's cheese is just melting almost like a little sauce inside it's so exciting but more importantly so easy to do it's got texture it's got creaminess and that for me will beat any omelette for brunch serve with a stack of hot butter toast and a steaming pot of coffee this easy frittata turned the humble egg into the perfect dish for kicking off the weekend [Music] pan on get that nice and hot you think of the sort of density of a pork chop how it needs a little bit of help sweet sound peppers go brilliantly well first slice the peppers that's the flat side of the pepper so stand it up trying to slice a pepper on the side is a nightmare there's the center start off it's almost like sort of peeling an orange go all the way around and down and look that's what you want now place the pepper down three finger rule one finger in front two behind pinky holding it down thumb holding it nice and flat the flatter the vegetables the more confident you are when you slice so don't worry about the speed just let the knife do the work and take your time speed comes the most important thing is to get your technique right red onion now sweet sour peppers olive oil in i'm going to saute them which is just the chef's turn for shallow frying on a high heat for maximum taste some salt and pepper add a tablespoon of sugar sugar helps to break down the peppers quicker but caramelize the onions frying them in a frying pan perfect it's one of the sort of basic essential tools of any kitchen because it's so multi-purpose great for sauteing tossing great for cooking fish on meat push away and pull back push away and pull back that hissing is something you need to hear constantly because the minute that's gone your peppers and your onions start to boil and you really want them to soak in you now start to see it glistening in the way that it's starting to caramelize sugar's working beautifully that's ready for the red wine vinegar in smells incredible it helps to stain the peppers as well look at the glaze now you can see the sugar it's worked as magic turn down the gas and add a couple of tablespoons of fresh extra virgin olive oil let them stew for two to three minutes now i want to make the peppers nice and light and sort of sweet aromatic just roll the basil almost like a big cigar slice basil in and then literally cook it out for 30 seconds i want them off beautiful okay pan back on now for the pork chops i want to make sure they don't curl up in the pan they start curling up in the pan they're going to cook unevenly a few simple cuts through the rind means the chop stays flat and cooks evenly point the knife down flip through this seasoned beautifully nice large shards of pepper punch that through lightly guaranteed that seasoning is gonna stay there hot pan touch garlic and touch of thyme the garlic take a couple of cloves don't peel it don't chop it just knife on crush it olive oil in just starting to smoke top of the chop in and lay away from me nice keep that heat in the pan put the garlic in there early a nice fragrant bunch of thyme see how the pork is staying nice and flat turn that over look at that beautiful i want a little bit of thyme underneath there start squeezing that garlic out i want the flavor coming out butter in thin slices of butter tilt the pan and baste so i'm sort of speeding up the cooking process at the same time i'm keeping the pork chop really nice and moist and now look at the color that butter it's almost like sort of a nut brown check the color on the other side useful when they're that thick three and a half to four minutes each side 30 seconds from now they're going to be medium so i'm going to take them out and let them rest the secret to perfectly moist pork chops is letting them rest almost as long as they're cooked in the pan [Music] a nice spoon of these peppers the basil smells incredible keep that garlic on there be generous with that vinaigrette from the peppers because it really is incredible do two things simple like that pork and peppers and your confidence is gonna shoot through the roof a stunning pork chop with sweet and sour peppers

Stuffed rib of beef with horseradish Yorkshire puddings & Beef & ale stew with mustard dumplings, twice-baked bubble and squeak jacket potatoes....",2022-12-03 22:16:02.926159, i think a fantastic sunday roast is the cornerstone of home cooking it's what the rest of the week's meals are built around and i absolutely love it but that doesn't mean it can't be improved to make the most out of my roast my main course is the delicious stuffed roast rib of beef complete with tangy horseradish yorkshire puddings [Music] but first i'm enlisting the help of my eldest 15 year old megan to reinvent one of my all-time favorite classic desserts and mess bomb right eat a mess what's the one thing you love about is a mess i love the meringues now this is a eaten mess with a twist what's the twist in it compared to the normal one we're gonna freeze it so it's almost like a sort of eaten mess bomb wow now i'd like you to whisk the cream please half the strawberries are going to go through the mix and half the strawberries are going to be turned into a coulis strawberries in first a little dusting of icing sugar into the pan and now the icing sugar will withdraw the sweetness from the strawberries and start caramelizing so let me show you a nice quick way of whisking secret whisking is like 10 seconds on and 10 seconds off that way your arms don't get tired now i'm going to take the cream to a three-quarter stage what is a three-quarter mix so we leave some sort of texture in the cream and that's what we call three-quarter whip you've got a nice soft peak they're caramelized there you go you put a little touch of water in there that'll help break down the sugar and turn that into a really nice strawberry liquid now to get it really nice and fine i'm gonna blend it on and blitz off okay that's fine i want you to use the back of the spoon and push that through the sieve okay now that way you don't get those seeds it smells so good i love this now nice this is the exciting part hold up oh mag right now the meringue with your fingers just crush and flake the meringue into the cream how big should i crush it dado there nice big chunks okay lovely oh you okay yeah come on rang in my eye damn to make this dessert even easier i often cheat by using good quality shop port meringues you know taste that's just cream and meringue wow it's a little tasty okay strawberries in next a couple of spoons of the cooling now look at that now to prepare the mold to transform the traditional eaten mess into a frozen bomb form a triple layer of clim film adding water to the bowl will help the climb film stick as i pour that in i want you to spread it down okay at the bottom and push it down can you hear that crunch yeah the line all right now fold the cling film over put that in the freezer please make young please in the freezer she goes [Music] dessert done now for our main course with a twist that is the rib eye we've had that in the fridge not wrapped so it sort of almost air dries and it intensifies the flavor gross so much quicker and there's less water in the beef for me the only downside to perfect roast dinner is the fight about who washes up afterwards so meg and i are going to avoid that by cooking everything in one roasting tin starting with the spinach and mushroom stuffing [Music] a little bit of salt and pepper please good girl some of your left shoulder some left shoulder thank you in with the garlic and the mushrooms to toss the pan you push down and pull back down and push back off you go take your time push it down and flip very good that's it push down nice that was lovely and again nice i'm gonna drop let's see well done well done well then right we're gonna sort of make a little well a little touch of butter in the middle now we need to start putting the spinach in the middle piece so you can push that down spinach is cold so you're not going to burn yourself be confident in the pan toss it and you'll see it wilting and disintegrating away wow who would have thought all that spinach could fit in this pan because it's a very delicate leaf it sort of cooks so quickly put this all on your board now and then i just want you to go and give that a nice chop then when you're confident with one hand want you to pick up the other knife the other hand chop it nicely good now outside and come in gently good regroup and take your time yes mmm right i love that smell what is that lemon thyme lemon tan that's right so you get your little thyme stalks and you pour down you sort of strip lemon thyme in now tarragon it'll taste brilliant with the beef fantastic with chicken and fish roughly chop the tarragon and i sprinkle the fresh breadcrumbs so the breadcrumbs almost sort of bring the stuffing together next we're gonna get an egg yolk now with the beef this is the exciting part slice with the bone and then come inside and go two thirds of the way down hold that open for daddy salt and pepper and then look we pack our stuffing in there this is amazing it's incredible now just gently hold out there like that okay yeah i'll see you tomorrow what tying string around the rib will keep it all together during roasting not too tight if we tie it too tightly what happens the stuffing will come out that's right that's ready for roasting but we're going to protect it and sit it on a trivet so a trivet basically is almost like a sort of little little bed a little bed that's right if you want to enjoy these delicious roast vegetables at their best make sure you remove them from the hot oven after 35 minutes and reheat before serving with your beef now a little mix for the top a couple of teaspoons of mustard powder in salt a couple of tablespoons of olive oil mix that in i'm gonna pour my mustard powder over the beef so this forms a really nice glaze my one pot roast dinner goes into a hot oven 15 minutes at 230 degrees then down to 170 degrees for another two hours for a delicious twist on traditional yorkshire puds i'm going to lace mine with fresh horseradish [Music] start with plain white flour in a bowl and crack in the eggs adding only half of your milk at this stage makes it much easier to whisk all the lumps out and if like me you like your puddings a little lighter and crispier add a dribble of cold water and add salt to season when you're happy your batter is lump free whisk in the remaining milk peel and grate horseradish and add a handful to the mix we can leave the batter to rest while we get the meat from the oven that is beautiful and this is where you really need to let it rest how long would you say to rest it for um i like to rest the meat for at least 20 minutes just the right amount of time for us to whack up the oven and to get our yorkshire puddings in i love using the rich dripping but vegetable all is a healthier option to get the fluffiest yorkshires your tray and fat must be piping hot for best results take your jug of batter to the oven and pour the mixture in there it takes just 15 minutes for our yorkshire puds to puff themselves up and turn a delicious golden brown with the yorkshire puddings on the way and the beef rested we can finish off the eater mess bomb run the bowl under the hot water twist and pull nice wow look at that beauty it's amazing sit that on to your plate now the finishing touches a drizzle of the remaining strawberry coulis just going to pour this over amazing flavor and some grated mint chocolate and that is a nice twist on a classic eaten mess a delicious eat and mess bomb beautiful let's go baby please don't drop that meg please it's not a rounders match dessert sorted and the beef is ready to serve up lift that up place that onto the board parsnips parrots you can see why we kept them in half they've got all that flavor one beautiful big slice for daddy one for maggie and then on the side it's stuffing the stuffing a bit that's the best to die for now fantastic yorkshire they're amazing aren't they beautiful mm-hmm that's for my daddy and that one that's for me beautiful roast beef with a twist wow [Music] these are my ultimate classics with a twist juicy river beef with horseradish spiked yorkshire puds and scrummy eaten mess bomb topped with strawberry coulis and mint chocolate dinner i'm doing a dish that every home cook should have a recipe for a great stick to your ribs stew here's my favorite beef and ale with mustard dumplings [Music] and helping in the kitchen is my youngest tilly [Music] tilly first things first i'd like you to season the stewing steak a nice spoon of flour mix yeah good girl what's the flour going to do dad the flour helps to brown the beef our seasoned flour will also help to add flavor and thicken the stew i feel a bit like marshmallows they do feel a little bit marshmallow don't they look at the size of the chunks of the beef i'm going to cut my carrots literally similar similar size that's right does that mean they'll cook equally that's right now these are little pearl onions i'm gonna put them in hole as well everything has to stay the same otherwise it could burn oh we've seen burn garlic before oh matilda she promised you weren't going to mention that what is that time time and what are they bay leaves bailey's good girl tablespoon of oil in the beef goes in first okay [Music] beautiful color remember the carrots thyme in good go garlic pearl onions in good give that a really good mix up [Music] daddy stews are very easy to make providing at the beginning you give it a little bit of love now that's all beautifully browned that bin that is beer and that's going to deglaze the pan adding beer or stout helps to tenderize the beef and give it a hearty delicious flavor and that's the only way i want you to taste beer in a stew yeah i want to add in a couple of teaspoons of tomato puree please in fact three please because it's so nice there's one final thing in there cover this durian's date with a bee stock give that a little mix with daddy please wow that's really nice it's not even cooked yet do you keep all these vegetables in when you serve it oh yes is the garlic going to be burnt no excuse me right and we always put the lid with a little bit just a little bit so it can breathe that's right not make the stew all watery into the oven at 150 please teals for about two and a half hours and now you focus on your homework fun time to knock up two delicious hearty potato classics in one twice baked bubbling squid jacket potatoes start by baking large potatoes in a preheated oven at 180 degrees shred one third of your savoy cabbage and saute in butter and add a dash of water until tender [Music] after about half an hour your potatoes should be crisp on the outside and cook through in the middle slice them in half and scoop out the soft potato center then mash with a couple of knobs of butter mix in the cabbage and season to taste spoon this mixture back into your potato shells and into the oven for a further 10 minutes or until the tops are nice and crispy and golden two delicious hearty potato classics in one twice baked bubbling squeak jacket potatoes

money bag are you going to do anything with the spare pears oh yeah you start building that up then you see the fresh ginger and those nice little bits of stem ginger let me go around mike with your glue we might glue just on top tilly's last job is to give our tart a good dusting of icing sugar so that caramelizes it and colors the pears beautifully it's a bit like snow isn't it now that glaze

favorites a marshmallow and peanut fridge cake perfect for a picnic first things first we have to slowly melt the chocolate that's bad that's good i'm gonna break up the chocolate right in there next butter goes in couple tablespoons of golden syrup it's so good if we melt chocolate too quickly it starts to separate and destroy the best and safest way to melt chocolate is always use a bain-marie but i'm going to keep a really close eye on mine and heat it over a super low heat this stunning little cake has your favorites in there our digestives now put your hands in there and give them like that one at a time ago and crush what's the one thing that you love about a picnic i love eating outside especially on a nice summery day not so much in the wind today no that's gonna be the crunchy part of our fridge cake and it's called a fridge cake because it can sit in the fridge or you can freeze it now peanuts in please can you use it without peanuts if you're allergic to peanuts oh you can do yeah definitely now what are these little babies cranberries cranberries from there marshmallows my favorite okay they're so bright aren't they why do you love marshmallows so much because they're so squishy all right give that a nice mix up chocolate is melting nicely okay i want you to pour that in and i'll mix it nice and gently slowly slowly slowly nice now touch more please good isn't it good give that a little mix with daddy please look they're all melty nice and cool and gooey now we're going to line the tray so this is quite easy to make because um you don't have to bake it you just set it yeah i want you to start pushing it into the corners please with your fingers just laying out nice and flat ah it's all nice and marshmallow and oozy to get the spatula okay and look how delicious does that look really delicious i can eat it right now i couldn't because it's not set so when that sets okay it'll go nice and firm and then we can cut it into little bars little squares triangles triangles [Music] good but the important part pushing it down is that we can slice it and the more we push the thinner we can slice okay [Music] fridge cake done now i'm gonna make the most amazing anchovy dip with vegetables and bread first cut slices of baguette and bake in the oven at 180 degrees c for six minutes or until crisp meanwhile roughly chop garlic and shallots and add to a food processor along with a tin of good quality anchovies sprinkle in some pitted black olives flat leaf parsley and drizzle in the reserved anchovy oil and a little olive oil blitz to a paste and add pepper then decant into a jar ready to transport serve with a handful of fresh baby carrots peppery radishes and your crisp baguette toast anchovy dip a portable and deliciously palatable alfresco treat [Music] now a spicy chilli yogurt dressing with a prawn salad first things first i'd like you to make the dressing fish sauce doesn't really smell like fishes so one and a half tablespoons of fish sauce two chilli i like this especially if you have it on the side of the pork little teaspoon of sugar oh that's it good in so four tablespoons of yogurt three four some zest in there why are you making it in a jam jar not a bowl well this is for a little picnic and it's a great way of transporting we squeeze the lime in there and then we put the lid on shake it and then i want you to shut it on tight [Music] come on it's a bit like a tummy see that sounds like my tummy only sometimes only sometimes thank you for that hi nick is you and the first time you have it's like a little thingy it's fresh salty citrusy but delicious now cucumber and the salad i want to get rid of all the seeds so if you just nice and gently peel the cucumber why do you feel it can you not eat the skin on it you can eat the skin but i want this salad to taste light and fresh you can use a knife for this too though can't you you can peel with a knife but the speed peeler takes off the slices nice and thinly so much quicker so much quicker that's why it's called a speed peeler looks better now looks a bit naked it does look a bit naked doesn't it now you get your spoon and see what happens a teaspoon just takes out all those seeds so whilst it sits in the dish it doesn't make the salad go all soft because that cucumber is nice and crunchy [Music] that's really good there you go so see where your knuckles are there that's what's always going to protect if you put that little finger out this little piggy boom comes off what did i tell you about daddy's knuckle that's the first place you cut off all the time there you go the next addition to our prawn salad is firm juicy baby gem lettuce look at the lettuce in half what about the butt the butts [Music] i'm keeping the butts on for now so when i slice it it stays together okay and then a little bit there we don't use okay when you prepare lettuce for a picnic you never slice it too thinly okay otherwise it will it's good prawns are ready [Music] your tummy sauce is ready your dressing is ready take the lid off and the trick is you dress the bottom of your dish because i'm going to put the prawns on here to protect the lettuce get your cucumber i put my cucumber on and then finally that is okay now the salad's not gonna go soft why is that because it's not that it's not straight onto the dressing that's right what happens is we wrap this now and then we get to our picnic drizzle the sauce on top we mix it up we've got the dressing on the bottom and the dressing on top of the dressing on top that's right a little bit of tim film do you know the cling film check i don't know the clint field trick yet no thing fell over the top of the toilet what you don't understand it when you're my age oh you've been my age then well okay salad in the fridge with the dressing ready to go for a picnic is my ultimate picnic dinner feast prawn and cucumber salad with a spicy yogurt dressing anchovy dip with crudites

the kitchen learning to use it with these is a must and i'm going to show you how first up my delicious pan fried pork chops with sweet and sour peppers whether it's in the restaurant or even at home one of my golden rules for producing fantastic food is learning to cook with confidence this recipe is so straightforward but tastes absolutely amazing pan on get that nice and hot you think of the sort of density of a pork chop how it needs a little bit of help sweet sound peppers go brilliantly well first slice the peppers that's the flat side of the pepper so stand it up trying to slice a pepper on the side is a nightmare there's the center start off it's almost like sort of peeling an orange go all the way around and down and look i see one now place the pepper down three finger rule one finger in front two behind pinky holding it down thumb holding it nice and flat the flatter the vegetables the more confident you are when you slice so don't worry about the speed just let the knife do the work and take your time speed comes the most important thing is to get your technique right red onion now sweet sour peppers olive oil in i'm going to saute them which is just the chef's turn for shallow frying on a high heat for maximum taste some salt and pepper add a tablespoon of sugar sugar helps to break down the peppers quicker but caramelize the onions frying them in a frying pan perfect it's one of the sort of basic essential tools of any kitchen because it's so multi-purpose great for sauteing tossing great for cooking fish on meat push away and pull back push away and pull back that hissing is something you need to hear constantly because the minute that's gone your peppers and your onions start to boil and you really want them to soak in you now start to see it's glistening in a way that it's starting to caramelize sugar's working beautifully that's ready pour the red wine vinegar in smells incredible it helps to stain the peppers as well look at the glaze now you can see the sugar it's worked as magic turn down the gas and add a couple of tablespoons of fresh extra virgin olive oil let them stew for two to three minutes now i want to make the peppers nice and light and sort of sweet aromatic just roll the basil almost like a big cigar slice basil in and then literally cook it out for 30 seconds i want them off beautiful okay pan back on now for the pork chops i want to make sure they don't curl up in the pan they start curling up in the pan they're going to cook unevenly a few simple cuts through the rind means the chop stays flat and cooks evenly point the knife down flip through it's seasoned them beautifully nice large shards of pepper punch that through lightly guaranteed that seasoning is going to stay there hot pan touch garlic and touch of thyme the garlic take a couple of cloves don't peel it don't chop it just knife on crush it olive oil in just starting to smoke top of the chop in and lay away from me nice keep that heat in the pan put the garlic in there early a nice fragrant bunch of thyme see how the pork is staying nice and flat turn that over i want a little bit of thyme underneath there start squeezing that garlic

your life on i'm gonna give you a hundred quick cooking tips to make your life in the kitchen easier first up how to keep your knife sharp it's far harder working in the kitchen with a blunt knife than it is with a sharp knife the secret behind keeping a sharp knife sharpen it before and every time you use it first grip the steel feel really comfortable about holding the still imagine you're holding a tennis racquet or you're playing squash you've got to be really comfortable with it now 45 degrees confident grip confident grip with a knife this is the butt of the steel really important to keep your fingers behind there you never grip a steel with your fingers over that because the knife comes back in you've just lost a finger always grip behind nice long strokes so we get the whole of the blade over steel stroke and we start from the bottom to the top so there across there across slow strokes over the top of the steel and then come back underneath then back underneath it is so dangerous working in the kitchen with a blunt knife you can cause so much damage working with a sharp knife is ten times quicker more efficient now that's ready to start chopping to stop your chopping board rocking or slipping a great tip is to simply wet a kitchen cloth kitchen paper or tea towel and place it underneath [Music] now you can chop with confidence [Music] my next top tip is get the most out of your humble veg peeler it's brilliant for slicing ultra thin ribbons of veg perfect for asian dishes great for making long delicate parmesan shavings to top soups and salads it also makes wonderful chocolate curls your pepper mill is more versatile than you might think tighten the top screw to get finely ground pepper ideal for soups and sauces [Music] for general seasoning you want it medium ground so set the screw in the middle and loosen it right off for coarse pepper perfect for steaks and fish peeling garlic for one clove simply bash it with the back of a knife and the skin comes off easily for a whole head crush separate into a bowl cover and shake hard for about 10 seconds then simply pick out the peeled cloves [Music] this is my ultimate cookery course 100 recipes to stake your life on i'll be showing you a roast chicken recipe to die for hold the drum and slice straight through but first like any good chef i'm always looking to get great ingredients at the right price my shopping mantra is simple first rely on your senses make sure whatever you're buying it looks smells and really feels good and if you get the chance taste it before you buy it second is to recognize that knowledge is crucial the more you know about where your ingredients come from and how they produce the better so ask lots of questions and learn you're never too old to learn from experts and when it comes to buying great birds one person knows what to look for is award-winning fifth generation master butcher danny lid gain poultry is a great meat because there's many different types of birds it's worth tasting the variation of flavours between different first to birds is massive turkey's a great lean meat that's available all year round not just for christmas anybody who's worried about eating fatty meats it's a really healthy flavoursome meal game birds people don't try them often enough once they're shot they're hung up for a little while but a few days at least it means the meat's going to be more tender it all adds flavor to the birds we've got a wood pigeon and a red leg partridge both really good and cook really quickly when you're buying a chicken some of the things to look out for is obviously the smell and when you're smelling a good quality chicken you can tell the difference the skin's a nice white color and it smells like a fresh chickeny smell when you're buying from a good butcher you'll find you tend to get the giblets as well which is basically the neck and other organs this is great for making gravy once you have cooked it you can use all the offcuts for other things stir-fries curries pasta dishes save the bones use the bones for stocks and soups a really packed full of flavor and remember there are lots of different breeds of chicken all have different characteristics and flavors so shop around and find the ones you love here are three of my all-time favorites the label anglais these come from an old british breed they've got smaller breasts but the meat's delicious the black leg a fantastic french variety succulent with bags of flavour and really meaty thighs and the pulley divorce this is the rolls royce of chickens rich gamey and delicious one for special occasions i think people should maybe try and buy less meat but aim for the best quality you're only going to get out what you put in by putting the best quality into a dish you're going to get the best results no matter how seasoned the chef you are there are always new ingredients and recipes to get fired up about so if a tired old recipe is getting you down spice it up with fresh ideas and flavors my next recipe is an old classic roast chicken but with a simple twist it takes on a new life and it's guaranteed to impress one of the things i love about cooking and it keeps me excited after 25 years behind the stove is that there's always something new to learn every day new ingredients new techniques and new cuisines start off with the stuffing [Music] it's amazing how exciting i stuffed roast chicken can be because it keeps the chicken incredibly moist and gives a delicious texture inside the bird i'm going to start off with cured ceriso this is a traditional spanish sausage and it's garlicky spicy incredibly meaty that gives a little bit of sort of richness to the stuffing get that cerezo in start cooking that down and getting all those oils out touch of olive oil in there to get it going right onions chopped add the onions to the cerezo and in a matter of seconds they'll change color as they soak up all the flavor that lovely spiciness has been stolen from that sausage now the onions smell incredible garlic garlicky fresh thyme just hold it down and put your fingers on there and it's a really nice way of taking off all those nice fragrant little time flowers you can hear it crackling in the background these are cannellini beans they're waxy very soft and so delicious but very dense but for stuffing they're so robust nothing breaks down drain them off in they're going to take on all that juice as well from this freezer i'm going to season them now because they're very dense so it needs some help i mean that looks like it's a dish on its own good enough to eat now i want to sweeten things up a little bit tomatoes half dried in that sweetens up the stuffing beautiful the stuffing's ready look at the color everything looks spanish it looks delicious now stuffing the chicken i like taking off these little knuckles as the chicken cooks the skin stretches over the bone you can get a really nice drum and take off those little wingtips as well salt pepper so important now you're stuffing i'm gonna go right inside the chicken push it down this really helps to cook the bird evenly because you're pushing out all the empty spaces in the carcass and take a nice large lemon push the lemon in pick up the person's nose pull the skin over olive oil on top salt and pepper a teaspoon of paprika sprinkle it on and then get your hands and sort of rub that in and see what the paprika is doing to the chicken putting this like sweet spicy marinade it's not even roasted yet but it looks delicious [Music] 400 ml of white wine same quantity of water that helps the chicken to steam chicken in be generous with the time sprigs [Music] make sure the fall is folded tightly around the roasting tray so the chicken steams in the oven keeping it moist and juicy into the oven [Music] cook for one hour at 180 degrees with a foil on nice take it out and remove the full lid then give it another 30 minutes to crisp up that skin look at that it's so important to make sure you take that tinfoil off with half an hour to go beautiful pierce that open squeeze it in that delicious gravy mix that into the tray and sieve that that's really nice fragrant lemony spiced roasting juices to finish before we cut up the chicken take out amazing stuffing [Music] incredible i'd have that with chicken over potatoes any day and

unusual choice for a dish like this but they work brilliantly although any type of pasta you've got in the cupboard will do and just twist that pan that stops any pasta actually sticking to the bottom

sausage will do when the meat has browned add half cherry tomatoes season [Music] and add a few spoonfuls of the pasta cooking water as the starch thickens the sauce and helps it stick to the pasta

simply want something delicious to enjoy these are three amazing pasta recipes you can learn by heart and cook in minutes beautiful [Music] now here are five more of my essential cooking tips starting with how to cook an ingredient that's perfect for a quick and easy tv dinner chicken breasts this has to be the most popular part of the chicken now it's very versatile incredibly tender very lean hardly any fat whatsoever the secret is cooking it without it becoming dry the first thing is to season it properly both sides two tablespoons of olive oil get the pan nice and hot the secret now is to get a really nice color on the skin really nice color no color no flavor skin side down tilt the pan so it cooks the back of the chicken breast where it's really nice and round and very fat let the pan do the work chicken breast normally takes between sort of 10 and 12 minutes to cook properly now we've got the color on the skin the skin's nice and crispy we're going to deglaze the pan deglaze with masala now masala has a sweet fortified italian wine you can also use white wine masala in flambe burn off the alcohol which gets rid of that really sort of harsh alcoholic flavor roll the chicken around the masala the glaze in the pan basically means washing the pan and lifting off all that flavor stuck to the bottom of the frying pan and put it into the sauce now chicken stock bring that up to the boil and let it simmer for three to four minutes [Music] really important to leave the chicken breast skin side up the skin's nice and crispy and it's important that the chicken cooks from underneath as it starts cooking it absorbs the stock so in the center of the chicken stays nice and moist [Music] now the stock of the masala is reduced down it's gonna have the confidence to allow it to almost disappear and look the combination between the masala and the chicken stock is quite sweet so it finishes the chicken with this really nice delicious glaze on top and there you go a delicious succulent chicken breast with the most amazing flavoursome skin phenomenal soups make stunningly simple meals my tip for adding incredible depth of flavor is to always keep your leftover parmesan rinds store them in the freezer then add to the pan as the soup cooks and leaves to infuse then remove before serving it's less waste and more taste another tip to take homemade soup to the next level whisking cubes of cold butter just before serving to get a glossy velvety texture and a beautifully rich taste another fantastic standard for a frost-free weekend eat is the classic baked potato my tip for great crispy skin is to use salt to your advantage simply add it to the outside before cooking and the salt will draw out the moisture in the oven as it bakes a touch of salt gives you an amazingly crisp skin on chicken and fish too as well as highlighting the flavor [Music] home roasted nuts make a delicious tv snack my tip for peeling them with these is to simply toast them in the oven for about 10 minutes wrap in a tea towel and rub until the skins are removed perfect sprinkle with sea salt and so with a glass of wine this is my ultimate cookery course 100 recipes to stake your life on coming up i'll be showing you my amazing sweet corn fritters that is such a delicious recipe but first the key to whipping up my ultimate tv dinners is having a well-stocked store covered

years and eating great pasta for a lifetime to make the best place in the world italy takes away the past in italy and the people died you know and that's it for a good very good pasta you need two

incredible pasta types that are great to keep in your store cupboard here's my quick guide to some of the different shapes and sizes and how to use them small shapes like farfallini are perfect for making simple stews and soups more substantial and add an extra texture to dishes like the classic italian pasta soup minestrone tubes like penne are great for thick cream or tomato based sauces as the rigid edges hold more sauce for an incredibly flavored packed mouthful long and thin like the store cupboard essential spaghetti the classic shape was invented in naples but every italian region has its own spaghetti dish from bolognese to carbonara or my favorite a lavongale which is spaghetti with delicious steamed clams flat noodles shaped strands like fettuccine are perfect with a simple drizzle of olive oil or in rich buttery dishes as a little sauce goes a long way coating the pasta evenly stopping the strands from sticking together then pass the sheets not just great for lasagnas but amazing rolled into tubes and filled to make delicious calalonie or used in quick supper dishes like my mushroom and leek pasta finally speciality pastas like this spaghetti made with squid ink has delicately sweet taste and an amazing jet black color great for when you want a delicious dinner that's a little bit different whatever shape you go for always look out for the pastas that have been bronze cut it means the dough was pressed through a bronze cutting dye which has a subtle rough texture which helps the sauce stick as well as all the dried types pasta also comes fresh which is brilliant for tv dinners because it cooks super quick and tastes incredible too in this shop we make pasta every day look at that that's beautiful it's sad to eat it this pasta is really really yellow

half and chop through it's a really nice quick way of slicing a chili into the mixture spring onion take off that outside layer of the spring onion top and tail slice it in an angle it's a little bit of texture running through the mixture i want that nice crunch in coriander just slice through nice and gently and get that in there next to the sweetcorn now drain it from the tin and just pat it dry

of delicious food that all centered around an asian staple noodles learn to cook those properly and you'd be surprised how quick and easy it is to knock off a delicious dinner first off we're gonna soak our noodles now these are rice noodles into a bowl and just pour the hot water over the rice noodles soak and rehydrate 12 to 15 minutes to soften up if you've got a wok perfect if not just a normal size frying pan with big sloping sides pan on get it really nice and hot chicken breast very lean hardly any fat on there you've got this little fillet just slice that off now the secret to getting it really nice and thin and to cut it into strips take your knife keep it nice and flat on the board and sort of slice it in half like a sort of scallop like that we call this butterfly in the chicken take a rolling pin and nice and gently roll over the chicken what it does it sort of flattens it allows you to slice it even thinner and the thinner the slices of the chicken the sort of crispier it gets the quicker it cooks slice it in half just start slicing these nice thin slices and the good news is one chicken breast can serve two or three easily next wash your knife and finally slice garlic the thinner the garlic the crispier this is a young tender broccoli just slice them down i want a bite to the broccoli and normally you sort of paste the dish with one-third noodles one-third vegetables and one-third of your protein chicken a dish that takes literally minutes to put together it's really important to get everything organized everything needs to be at your fingertips touch of olive oil get a pan really nice and ready just starting to smoke drop the chicken in first salt pepper open up those little strands of chicken nice [Music] once you've started to sear off the chicken get the garlic in now let that get really nice and crispy the way to do it is to sort of spread all the chicken the garlic up the side of the pan and see why it's so important to cut the chicken thin strips because it colors and cooks at the same time as well really really crucial now that garlic's getting really nice and crispy broccoli in feels strange putting raw broccoli in like that normally we'll blanch it in boiling water dry it out but you want that crunch now soy sauce that helps to season it but also stains beautifully soy sauce in lovely it's exactly what i want now take that out give your pan a little wipe out a little teaspoon of olive oil get that wok really nicely oiled again drain your noodles they're beautiful this is a really exciting way of finishing this quick stir fry very classic two eggs in [Music] whisk up the eggs and give that a really good whisk [Music] sort of almost spread it at the side of the pan lightly season the eggs noodles in chicken and broccoli in [Music] and give that a really nice mix you want the egg to sort of almost bring the dish together that egg's cooked make sure you've got that nice even distribution of chicken broccoli garlic lovely and then just finish that fresh lime and then you have a very simple delicious stir-fry with rice noodles [Music] homemade gnocchi making your enoki is so simple to do yet the results are absolutely stunning and it's a great way of using up leftover baked potatoes can make noki just with flour and eggs however the potato gives it a nice light sort of creamy fluffy texture cut them in half take your spoon and scoop the inside of those potatoes i'm using leftover baked potatoes but this really works as well with leftover ball potatoes two choices you can get a fork and sort of mash the potato and get it nice and light and fluffy or this little gadget is called a ricer i suppose it's a posh word for a potato masher just squeeze gently you can see how nice and light it is almost like fluffy little strands of potato you can do this when the potatoes are hot it'll go through the rice so much quicker just slice that off there now a nice spoon of okata ring a little touch of salt and pepper it's really important to season the mixture as we go along otherwise the nokia becomes really bland flour over the ricotta sieved so there's no lumps one delicious egg give that a little whisk now make a little well in the center you want a nice soft pliable ball of dough give that a really good mix get some thyme flowers in there and this time is light fragrant and it's just a really nice herb and with the ricotta it tastes brilliant just pick the little tips the time flowers next flour your hands generously and knead the mixture into a dough fold in and push and basically what it's doing is get it nice and smooth as it starts to get a little bit wet and just add a little touch of flour we want something really nice and soft now don't overwork it it stops the nokia from expanding when it hits the pan that's exactly what i want a nice sort of soft fragrant ball cut the ball in half lightly flour the hands and just roll it gently just think of a a big long cigar the mixture will start getting a little bit sort of wetter but do not add lots of flour now lightly flour the knife so when you slice the gnocchi it doesn't stick cut the dough into bite-sized pieces just take your finger dip it in the flour and push down why i want my knocking to look like a pillow and for me the most important part there is that not one of them are identically the same shape water on bring up to the boil little touch of olive oil in there lightly flour your hand lift up the nokia in to the rolling boiling water turn that pan to stop them from sticking at the bottom and let them simmer and they start to sort of tell you they're cooked when they start floating get a pan on get that nice and hot now they're just starting to come up to the top and you can continue cooking them like that i like blanching them in the water taking them out and then frying them to study the gnocchi heat olive oil in a frying pan gently lift up and look they've doubled in size drain it get rid of the excess water and straight in to the hot pan [Music] this is where they start to take on a completely different texture nice crisp sauteed texture on the outside nokia loves fresh pepper so pepper in [Music] you can see as i start turning them got this really nice little sort of brown color and they're almost popping up now like little parcels so i want them nice and sauteed both sides but light and creamy in the center fresh garden peas in and the butter gives it a really nice sort of bernoulli flavor on the end beautiful put a little bit of fresh thyme over the peas and then finally i want to lift it up fresh lemon zest the lemon over [Music] smells incredible and then finally seal the deal with a touch of grated parmesan cheese give your vegetable attitude and you'll get amazingly elegant dishes on a budget that are always guaranteed to impress what more do you want from great cooking cheap to make easy to cook and absolutely stunning spicy sausage rice whatever you're cooking the secret to making great food is to ensure you're locking every last ounce of flavour in that pan and this spicy sausage rice does exactly that take these spicy sausages and pierce that skin because i want all that delicious spicy sausage meat out of this casing and you get more flavor from the sausage when you take them out the casing sausage is ready turn on the gas bread onion less acidic than a big white spanish onion and a lot more flavoursome tablespoon of olive oil a tablespoon only because i want all that fat coming out the sausages to sort of really help flavor the onions onions in and the onions go in first because you can never rush cooking an onion it's really important to sort of give them five to six minutes in the pan so you can really start to caramelize them my mouth and my pepper slice around wasting nothing i want to see that sort of little core those pips in the center no fine diced pepper the rice is going to be cooking for 20 minutes so i want the veg to sort of have texture after it's cooked peppers in a bit of garlic two nice cloves just slap down off with the shell garlic in now i want to turn up the gas get the pan nice and hot because the minute that sausage goes in everything cools down and you'll end up boiling the peppers and the onions and the garlic so heat up to maximum and then just make a well in the center in now start stirring quickly this is where you get so much more bang for your buck out of sausages because the skins off and the real flavor of that spicy italian sausage is going to come through what's great about this recipe is that you can use any type of sausage to get the flavor and the heat you want i've gone for the spicy italian but it's just as good with merguez or cheeto a teaspoon paprika in give it that really nice smoky flavor rice in and we're going to sort of basically sear the rice we call it in the kitchen blasting the rice where we sort of soda the rice for 30 seconds and it takes on all that flavor next white wine so the wine sort of deglazes the pan and washes all that flavor from the bottom of the pan into the rice stock in bring it up to the boil turn it down and let it simmer [Music] double stop to rice turn that gas down and let it simmer for 12 to 15 minutes and just give it the occasional stir keep an eye on it now get ready to finish it slice spring onions diced sweet juicy tomatoes and roughly chop earthy flat leaf parsley spring onions in tomatoes in off with the gas really important otherwise everything becomes overcooked flat leaf parsley in but look at the volume in that pan now that is an amazing way to take spicy italian sausages to a completely different level beautiful [Music]

fresh ginger and three little cinnamon sticks i want you to remember that because we're gonna look for them okay because once we've used them and they've worked their magic i need to pull them out see

food whenever you want really important put the water on first so you can just have it gently simmering away ready for the pasta while the water comes to the boil start the sauce by slicing mushrooms first off fingers one in front two behind up and down then add olive oil to a hot frying pan [Music] i want that nice color on the mushrooms off the heat literally 10 seconds and when you toss something really important you get all the ingredients at the end of the pan push down and pull back that noise that that's all the water coming out of the mushrooms next finely chop a fat clove of garlic [Music] then prepare your leeks just take your knife and go down through the center turn it over and again into quarters see all that opening up and then just rinse the top of that to get rid of any potential dirt or sand it just breaks up into nice little quarters add all that leak into those mushrooms beautiful and now the secret is to get rid of that water inside the leek as it cooks down all the water's gone you just left that really nice intense flavor garlic's got nice and crispy now we're gonna add a touch of chicken stock in there beautiful lasagna sheets just gonna drop the sheets in to the water lasagna sheets are an unusual choice for a dish like this but they work brilliantly although any type of pasta you've got in the cupboard will do and just twist that pan that stops any pasta actually sticking to the bottom of the pan chicken start to reduce down by half and it's almost delayed the bottom of the pan basically washed all that wonderful flavor off turn the gas down and add a couple of tablespoons of cream this just enriches the dish bring it back up to the bowl and let it simmer for three to four minutes now the secret with the pasta is just taking it out a little early so you've got that nice texture hold up the sheet and just nip it and you can feel your fingers in the center it's ready turn the sauce down and lay these beautiful sheets of lasagna into that sauce i'm just going to turn the gas off now and let the pasta sit in there and absorb that amazing sauce finish with chopped fresh tarragon it's a delicious herb it goes brilliantly well mushrooms and leeks just let that sit and almost sort of infuse to serve i'm making a quick bruschetta by toasting fresh chipata bread two nice slices drizzle that in olive oil a little bit of garlic just rub the bread the crust as well crust is what really takes that garlic now pan for the bread a little touch of olive oil as it starts to smoke bread in [Music] but look at the pasta now it's been stained by that amazing sauce to serve i want a nice spoon of my mushrooms leeks and cream then i'll take my pasta just twist it and let it sit on top that tarragon has just lifted everything bread on and that's the beauty about something so simple that can be done in 20 minutes with everyday ingredients a stunning pasta dish adding easy and versatile dishes like this to your repertoire is what cooking at home is all about so my next tasty dish uses simple and cheap store covered ingredients with stunning results and takes minutes to make sweet corn fritters and yogurt dip it's brilliant to have a number of great recipes up your sleeve to rely on and let's be honest we've all got a tin of sweetcorn somewhere so i'm going to show you how to make the most amazing fritter [Music] first off the mixture take your flour sieve really important to sieve the flour that stops the mixture from having any lumps in there just before you get to the end i want to put half a teaspoon of baking powder the baking powder gives the mixture some lift in and just sieve that through a touch of salt and pepper next an egg about four tablespoons of milk and give that a little whisk now just put a little drizzle of olive oil in there that helps to relax the mixture whisk that in make sure we got rid of all those lumps so that i want a nice smooth almost like a cake mixture

an asian staple noodles learned to cook those properly and you'll be surprised how quick and easy it is to knock off a delicious dinner first off we're gonna soak our noodles now these are rice noodles into a bowl and just pour the hot water over the rice noodles soak and rehydrate 12 to 15 minutes to soften up if you've got a wok perfect if not just a normal size frying pan with big sloping sides pan on get it really nice and hot chicken breast very lean hardly any fat on there you've got this little fillet just slice that off now the secret to getting it really nice and thin and to cut

i've loved it ever since i was a kid and to make it even more delicious i've given it a few modern tweaks for my ultimate fish i'm doing the best crunchiest lightest batter imaginable with a hint of ginger to go with it chilly minted mushy peas [Music] in order to make sure that the batter stays nice and crispy and the fish stays nice and firm the secret is to season the fish salt and pepper that will draw out the moisture and that will keep the fish really nice and firm put it in the fridge for around 10 minutes to let the seasoning work its magic now the batter as always when making any batter always sieve the flour i want a bit of heat in the batter so a nice teaspoon of cayenne pepper season the flour salt and pepper and then two teaspoons of baking powder this almost lightens the load with the batter now ginger beer it gives that batter this sort of unique spicy individual flavor it's delicious with a fish and a nice tablespoon of oil just basic vegetable oil gives it a nice sheen give it a good mix you really want it almost like the consistency of double cream too thin and the batter runs off especially when it hits the fryer too thick and it actually prevents the fish from getting cooked so you've got to get it to that just that sort of double cream texture let it rest for as long as possible to give you an even textured batter now the season should have worked its magic and drawn out the excess moisture from the fish so it's on to the next stage fish has gone slightly firmer perfect for frying start by coating the fish in flour seasoned with pepper pat that nice and dry into your hands so you haven't got any excess flour the flour stops the batter from running off the fish i'm just gonna check to see if my oil's ready by putting a little touch of batter into the fryer you see it bubbling straight to the very top that tells you that the oil is ready never really ever fill the pan above halfway if the oil starts to get too hot first thing you do turn off the gas second thing add some oil into it to cool it down hold the fish by the corner unless you put it in and roll it round then gently slap the fish on the sides of the bowl to get rid of excess batter now in and lay away and just gently drop it in twist your pan that stops it from sticking at the bottom oil should be gently sort of bubbling away but notice as we're frying the fish there's no spitting of any water from the fish fry the fish for three to five minutes gently turning halfway through once the batter is golden and crisp it's ready look they look stunning it's like these big crispy pillows of beautifully textured cotton leave the fish to rest on a kitchen towel to blot excess oil meanwhile it's quick and easy chilli minted mushy peas now how much you peas a little teaspoon of olive oil and a nice knob of butter into the pan shallot finely chopped that adds a bit of sweetness to the peas slots into the pan chili these are delicious when you eat peas and they're slightly spicy they're even better garlic in the peas sweat off the chilli the garlic and the schlotz before the peas join those spices simply blanch and salted boiling water infuse with their perfect partner fresh mint stalks and all and then put your frozen peas in now what's the peas i've got nice and soft drain them now take off the stalks and then add your peas to the shallots i love that sound mix all that chili and garlic in there a little seasoning finishing the frozen peas off like this absolutely delicious onto your board crush now you cannot beat crushed delicious peas look at that those peas is incredible top with chopped mint chilli minted mushy peas so simple and perfect with easy ginger beer battered fish a nice spicy crispy batter and that just reaffirms the importance of comfort food if you're gonna do it do it properly [Music] my spicy twist is proof you can update a comforting classic and the best way to eat this is with crispy buttered sauteed potatoes cooked with garlic rosemary and thyme to take this happy food to a whole new level [Music] when i was growing up food in britain was somewhat different to what it is now no one had heard of organic you could even buy avocados in the shops where i lived paris kitchens might have been cooking nouvelle cuisine but it certainly hadn't made any inroads around our way moulton at lunch when i was growing up was very plain pretty trashy but i still love it now and again fish fingers with a delicious chip butty the secret of a good chip butti is in the potato now these are desiree potatoes one of my first ever jobs was working in a chip shop i used to put sacks and sacks of potatoes into the rumbler which was then the potato peeler all day long today i'm gonna do something a bit healthier for my oven chips with a twist simply peel slice and blanch for three to four minutes drain season and cover well with propeca spread evenly over an oiled baking tray and place into a preheated oven for 20 minutes simple as that next up easy fish fingers this is pollock a really nice firm delicious fish got the fish in finger size batons of fish put them onto your plate and just lightly salt them you can do that literally 20 minutes 30 minutes before you start cooking the fish it firms the fish up beautifully and it allows it to become a little more durable especially in the pan now for the coating start by thoroughly coating the fish in seasoned flour and then just roll it to get rid of those little sharp corners because then it stops those corners almost burning in the pan in to your egg wash and really coat them wonderful and then this is dill goes brilliantly well with a fish and run the dill through my breadcrumbs that makes it more aromatic lay them onto your breadcrumbs nothing wrong with the chip butty nothing wrong with fish fingers just give it a lovely modern twist beautiful once the fish fingers are thoroughly coated they're ready to pan fry and they'll need around three minutes on each side i want the fish fingers to be nice and crispy get a really nice color on them first and then we'll flip them over and finish them with butter bring the heat up into the pan and a nice little knob of butter that'll work wonders with the breadcrumbs and the dill nice and carefully take them out and look and smell incredible so nice and crispy now to assemble my chip butty starting with butter thick crusty bread [Music] slice of bread mop up that amazing flavor on slice in half never slice in an angle my mouth is salivating beautiful on with the ship buddy there's one thing missing and it signifies that i've never forgotten the joy i've come for food but my god that makes me feel like a nine-year-old excuse me for one moment when want to stuff my face [Applause] [Music] homemade fish fingers and my ultimate chip buddy so simple to make but trust me it tastes amazing boiled eggs with a soldier that will make your taste buds stand to attention there's something quite nostalgic about a bald egg it's something that's never lost it's magic when you slice that top off and dunk that soldier into the yolk you can't mess with a deliciously runny yolk but this is what i like to dunk in it an anchovy soldier anchovies interpersonal water no salt naturally yeah anchovies are very salty so just a touch of pepper in omega-3s the amazing tinned anchovy is a natural flavor enhancer and i use it to pepper many a savory dish from roast lamb to the humble toasted soldier grind them it's a really nice smooth paste the smell of that is almost like being at the seaside now get your soft butter and just put half the butter in first 50 50 is the way 50 percent anchovy 50 butter that way got that real nice salty creaminess mix that up that's absolutely delicious trust me finishing that anchovy butter on a slice of grilled fish i'm in heaven the bread this is a sourdough delicious very crusty take four nice slices now get that pan nice and hot a couple of tablespoons of that anchovy oil into the pan and then get your bread and lightly fry each side the smell of the anchovy oil is incredible take that out now bring your water up to the boil the secret of softly boiling an egg is to place them into the water gently on a spoon in and just tilt so they don't hit the bottom nice and light up to the boil count to five turn the gas down is it four and a half minutes is it five minutes for a softball day i've cooked thousands of them and every time it's four and a half minutes whilst that's boiling get your bread and spread that on there that is incredible chopped parsley brings that kind of freshness goes brilliantly well with the anchovies hear that crunch on inside but i can't resist oh my god right gas off one beauty in two i feel like a five-year-old again this is that moment when you open the vault and that little magic inside is all yours there's a great twist on a great classic wow [Music] perfectly soft boiled eggs with dressed up anchovy butter soldiers who would have thought that egg and soldiers could be that delicious [Music] you

home one of my golden rules for producing fantastic food is learning to cook with confidence this recipe is so straightforward but tastes absolutely amazing pan on get that nice and hot you think of the sort of density of a pork chop how it needs a little bit of help sweet sound peppers go brilliantly well first slice the peppers that's the flat side of the pepper so stand it up trying to slice a pepper on the side is a nightmare there's the center start off it's almost like sort of peeling an orange go all the way around and down and look that's what you want now place the pepper down three finger rule one finger in front two behind pinky holding it down thumb holding it nice and flat the flatter the vegetables the more confident you are when you slice so don't worry about the speed just let the knife do the work and take your time speed comes the most important thing is to get your technique right red onion now sweet sour peppers olive oil in i'm going to saute them which is just the chef's turn for shallow frying on a high heat for maximum taste some salt and pepper add a tablespoon of sugar sugar helps to break down the peppers quicker but caramelise the onions frying them in a frying pan perfect it's one of the sort of basic essential tools of any kitchen because it's so multi-purpose great for sauteing tossing great for cooking fish on meat push away and pull back push away and pull back that hissing is something you need to hear constantly because the minute that's gone your peppers and your onions start to boil and you really want them to soak in you now start to see glistening in a way that it's starting to caramelize sugar's working beautifully that's ready for the red wine vinegar in smells incredible it helps to stain the peppers as well look at the glaze now you can see the sugar it's worked as magic turn down the gas and add a couple of tablespoons of fresh extra virgin olive oil let them stew for two to three minutes now i want to make the peppers nice and light and sort of sweet aromatic just roll the basil almost like a big cigar slice basil in and then literally cook it out for 30 seconds i want them off beautiful okay pan back on now for the pork chops i want to make sure they don't curl up in the pan they start curling up in the pan they're going to cook unevenly a few simple cuts through the rind means the chop stays flat and cooks evenly point the knife down flip through this seasoned beautifully nice large shards of pepper punch that through lightly guaranteed that seasoning is gonna stay there hot pan touch garlic and touch of thyme and the garlic take a couple of cloves don't peel it don't chop it just knife on crush it olive oil in just starting to smoke top of the chop in and lay away from me nice keep that heat in the pan put the garlic in there early a nice fragrant bunch of thyme see how the pork is staying nice and flat turn that over look at that beautiful i want a little bit of thyme underneath there start squeezing that garlic out i want the flavor coming out butter in thin slices of butter tilt the pan and baste so i'm sort of speeding up the cooking process at the same time i'm keeping the pork chop really nice and moist and now look at the color that butter it's almost like sort of a nut brown check the color on the other side useful when they're that thick three and a half to four minutes each side 30 seconds from now they're going to be medium so i'm going to take them out and let them rest the secret to perfectly moist pork chops is letting them rest almost as long as they're cooked in the pan [Music] a nice spoon of these peppers the basil smells incredible keep that garlic on there be generous with that vinaigrette from the peppers because it really is incredible do two things simple like that pork and peppers and your confidence is gonna shoot through the roof a stunning pork chop with sweet and sour peppers my next recipe can be kept on tap in the fridge for weeks on end and is guaranteed to liven up any quick meal spicy chutney with chutney standing by in the fridge you can always add that special little touch to a simple supper prove that thinking ahead always pays off pan on start toasting those spices keep the pan nice and low cumin very aromatic very fragrant and it's almost like a light spice next nice little coriander seeds coriander in now you're going to get a bit of heat in the chutney mustard seeds well smaller than coriander seeds but so much more powerful mustard seeds in now curry leaves they don't actually smell much dry but the flavor they give off is extraordinary kodi's in really important not to burn them otherwise you'll have that bitter taste across the chutney keep the gas nice and low the secret is sort of toasting them so it releases that oil and intensifies the spice touch of salt and then a couple small powerful chilies keep them whole no one's gonna eat them but it gives that real nice burst of heat now let them toast gently there we're not gonna chop the onion we're gonna grate it why because it sort of breaks down to a really nice puree in the chutney when you're grated hold the root in the palm of your hand and just push nice long grates i want those nice long shards look i've almost got a nice sort of onion puree but it's nice and clear a touch of olive oil spices nicely toasted onions in [Music] three nice cloves of garlic lightly crushed them [Music] lay it nice and flat and just slice the garlic nice thin slices garlic in taking your time to get the owners caramelised beautifully will really reap rewards in the long run tamarind paste and sugar in with the sugar first three nice tablespoons of sugar that will give a really nice syrup effect sort of nice rich syrupy texture to the chutney tamarind paste you can get tamarind paste in most delis and the big supermarkets it's really nice thickening asian but it gives that tartness the chutney and it's sort of rich sugary spicy next in with my coconut add four nice tablespoons that will give a nice body and a really nice texture to the chutney cook that coconut out and now add the carrot grated the carrot just gives the chutney a really nice sort of crunch but also helps to sort of cool down the spice carrots in the water comes out the carrot flavors the chutney beautifully but gives that nice sort of vibrant bright color to it as well and grating it almost sort of it cooks instantly but i want a bit of texture through here turn down the gas and just let that simmer for five minutes if the carrots aren't that moist and juicy then put a couple of tablespoons of water in there to help it along now just cook that out for five minutes just as those carrots start going nice and soft don't overcook them you want that nice texture in there slightly spicy slightly sweet gas off keep those chillies in there for that it's beautiful nice and gooey delicious and ready to go in this jar as that sits in the fridge just gets better and better and better i love to eat this chutney with cold meats or even cold fish but with ham it's amazing it's a really nice way of living up the ham just sort of roll it up get a nice spoon of chutney i mean it looks fantastic chutney onto the plate and serve and that is a nice little gem in the fridge that is worth prepping in advance for first off start with the dough tip 500 grams of strong bread flour into a mixing bowl and add 20 grams of semolina that gives the vacation it's sort of rustic charm now there's one thing for catcher needs it's really good seasoning you can't season bread after it's baked so it's got to go in right at the very beginning sprinkling 15 grams of dried yeast take some warm water and then 50 mils of olive oil top of that water that gives it this really nice silky rich texture make a little well mix up that yeast water and oil in start off with your fingers keep your fingers nice and open it's like a little sort of whisk going in there i'm looking for a really nice sort of relaxed dough now that's just starting to come together touch more water with oil in there give a little swirl and then again the secret is to sort of knead it gently don't overwork it it's a sort of easy bread to make a nice one to start off with when you're making bread for the first time basically kneading means just knit it together just hanging lightly flour your board and let's just knead that focaccia into a nice smooth dough make sure you don't over add too much flour otherwise it sort of dries out the dough something quite magical about making bread you can switch off and lose yourself my first job for a three-mission style establishment was a baker i was 22 years of age i usually start at midnight i was under such a tight schedule one o'clock white bread then two o'clock brown bread three o'clock sourdough four o'clock cheese bread five o'clock proof bake six o'clock crack them open and taste it was amazing beautiful yeah looks stunning it hasn't even risen yet leave your dough to rise in a warm place until it's doubled in size we call this proving [Music] that beautiful a lot of chefs sort of need it for the second time but i'm looking for a really nice light aerated for catcher take your tray a touch of olive oil in there season it at the bottom really important that's the exciting thing about focaccia you've got that really nice sort of salty top and salty bottom and just with a touch of olive oil on your hands gently push that in and almost massage it into the corners it's possible to put sort of olives and tomatoes and garlic through the dough but it never really allows the dough to sort of aerate properly when you put so much ingredients in i'm gonna stick mine on top use your finger and sort of just push them in salt on top some pepper on top as well i want some nice fresh amazing rosemary just hold the stalk and just pull off and then just sprinkle down generous in the rosemary really important to have that nice fragrance on top of the fuckache finish it off before it goes in with a little drizzle of olive oil so it almost sinks in those little pockets of flavor olive tomato rosemary and olive oil into the oven bake your focaccia at 200 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes [Music] smells delicious [Music] beautiful [Music] you can hear how crispy that is you can't beat a nice warm fresh slice of home-cooked focaccia it's rustic charming and it's the perfect way to start baking making homemade for catcher it's so addictive you

dishes are always the simplest these crumpets are absolutely delicious and it's a great end to a fantastic brunch first off we're gonna make the mix when you think of growing up the smell and the taste of amazing crumpet it never leaves you to make the mix the secret is to bring the milk up the ball but do not boil it the minute it boils turn it off and let it sit there now flour in a nice pinch of salt in now add half a teaspoon of bicarb that gives it aeration and really lifts the mixture up all those lovely little holes a nice pinch of sugar and then a teaspoon of yeast dry yeast now once the milk's boiled turn it off and add some warm water about 10 tablespoons 150 ml that cools down the milk but more importantly it doesn't destroy the yeast half of the milk in first stop and give that a really good mix now the rest of it [Music] [Music] you can just see that there's no lumps through there as it drips through the whisk now we're looking for it to double in size and get nice and light so pop in a warm place whilst you get on with the delicious topping [Music] beautiful strawberries but caramelised almost like a very quick strawberry jam hang on [Music] just slice these in half some sugar a couple of tablespoons we're gonna take the sugar to a nice light caramel it's just starting to change color now turn the gas down and we're gonna add the strawberries beautiful just sweating the strawberries down quickly and the caramels breaking down a wonderful glaze on the strawberries some lemon grated into the strawberries gives it that kind of freshness that really starts to break down the strawberries nice gas up smells incredible some lemon juice a touch of balsamo vinegar in that gives it that really nice delicious tartness now off it goes as the strawberries start to cool down it will naturally thicken and set beautifully nice [Music] now for the crumpet it's almost doubled in size but be very careful you don't knock the bowl because it can sort of push out all that air it's aerated it's nice it's light just see the texture she's ready to go did you boil it here we go instead of making normal small crumpets i'm making a giant one ideal for sharing now turn the gas down you just start to see a traditional crumpet style cooking process we want those nice tiny little holes on top and then crispy crunchy base right now it's time to add the butter just slide the butter down the back that gives it a really nice nutty flavor at the end fish nice flip beautiful take that out take the jam spoon the secret is for the juice to sort of run inside all those little holes think of that tartness of the balsamic vinegar the strawberries beautifully soft and almost pureed wrapped in that delicious caramel now finish that with a nice ball of creme fraiche and let that sit there and that is an amazing way of finishing off a traditional brunch with something sweet something delicious and something you're dying to tuck into [Music] soft fiery and irresistible spicy pancakes one of the secrets to good cooking is learning to use your imagination when it comes to brunches you don't have to stick to the old standbys these delicious spicy pancakes are really great alternative but more importantly so easy to do start off by toasting your cumin [Music] it's a dry roast basically non-stick pan just a touch of seasoning the salt helps to dry out the cumin even more and then fresh ginger slice them nice and thinly stack it back up and then just slice nice little thin slices in there and then keep that bunched up shake the chilli removing the seeds will prevent things getting too hot now garlic nice now add olive oil to your toasted cumin seeds and then with the garlic ginger and chili lovely [Music] and it feels strange when you talk about garlic for breakfast but the time i spent in india everybody was eating something savory for breakfast it was extraordinary into your bowl and set aside next the pancake filling add olive oil to a hot pan mustard seeds in now they'll start dancing the minute they hit the pan then finely slice an onion onions in a little teaspoon of turmeric sprinkle that in and look at the color an instant change leftover potatoes just slice them the smell is incredible potatoes in now spread the potatoes across the pan on the potatoes stained i want them sort of absorbing all that really nice turmeric actually like a sponge season those potatoes and it really helps to bring out the spice beautifully they're ready turn off the gas and let them sit there and absorb all those flavors back to the pancake batter add plain flour to your cooled garlic chili ginger and cumin seeds touch with salt and pepper nothing worse than the bland pancake one whole egg milk hold the jug with one hand and whisk we have a secret to get that really nice smooth paste but whisking that egg first and brings it together and then you're milking don't put all the milk in because then you're gonna get a lumpy pancake mix and if you put less milk in it really helps it not going lumpy look at that milk here and the secret for me is to have a nice thin mix now just a little teaspoon of oil that helps to bring a nice crispy edge to the mixture now just taste that's the texture pan on the larger the pan the better it helps to create a nice thin even surface i want that mix going all the way around the pan before you put the mixture into the pan make sure you give your pancake mix a really nice stir pan it's nice and hot turn down the gas a touch of olive oil in get that nice whisk with one hand pan to the mix in one and a half ladles and then roll it around so it's really nice and thin i want to see the ginger the garlic that's what i'm looking for in there now back onto the heat it only starts to remove from the bottom of the pan and lifts itself up once it's cooked these little bubbles confirm that it's just starting to lift off the pan a little shake that releases it and then just shake it to the end and toss if you haven't got the confidence tossing then use a spatula and turn it over now that's exactly what i want that nice sort of crisp edge around the side the color on the pancake is so important now roll it round and just let it slide out beautifully now for the exciting part filling them take your potatoes just sort of have a really nice imaginary line and then just very carefully roll that nice and tightly tuck it underneath there pull it back and roll useful the delicious pancakes are ready to eat but with a simple dipping sauce there'll be a real treat just mix chopped coriander with natural yoghurt that's really nice cooling asian sit there on the side and that for me is a great brunch delicious spicy pancakes amazing you

day in the restaurant and on the other hand there was the food you ate in people's homes which is a lot simpler to make but still absolutely delicious my ultimate french-inspired lunch is very light bright and really takes me back to when i lived in paris it's my take on the salad nicoise served with a delicious ghost cheese and pear tartine think of the nicoise as an assembly job of delicious ingredients brought together with a fantastic dressing the secret behind my salad nicoise is in the dressing spoon dijon mustard into a pestle and mortar some people top the salad with anchovies and capers but in mine they're the base to the dressing we're gonna grind that to a paste and then get the garlic in there season well with black pepper it doesn't need any salt in there because of the anchovies add a couple tablespoons of red wine vinegar olive oil and lastly flat leaf parsley to give the dressing freshness against those deep flavors it's a thick rich substantial dressing dressing done now for the salad ball potatoes green beans and eggs from a rolling ball seven and a half to eight minutes you should keep that nice yolky creamy texture in the center once the eggs are ready put them into cold water to stop them cooking and this is a great trick to peel them so much easier peeling eggs when you use the water that they've been cooling down in and the water will seep underneath all the shell so the whole shell just gets peeled off with one beautiful big layer now beans nice and crunchy season the beans and potatoes whilst they're still warm so they absorb more flavor a little drizzle of olive oil salt pepper and just let them sit there whilst the potatoes and beans cool down i'm doing a simple french open sandwich which is called a tartine this is delicious first i'm toasting baguette on the griddle lightly oil your griddle pan get your bread stick it on there take a pear it goes brilliantly well with goat's cheese slice the pear into finger width pieces that's the color we're looking for that dark crispy texture now for the ghost cheese give it a season it doesn't need salt because a little fresco cheese is already quite salty then a handful of crumbled walnuts they go under the grill whilst they put the tuna nice ones together my secret to assembling a great nicoise salad is to start in the middle of the plate and add ingredients layer by layer there's one thing i'm always missing the bottom of salad is dressing so i like to put it on the plate first baby gem lettuce is great because it's robust and holds that heavy dressing then add firm waxy salad potatoes and green beans i like them to have a bit of a crunch canned tuna can be fantastic i'm using a good quality one in olive oil which has been drained next baby plum tomatoes which have a lovely intense sweet flavor and then my eggs that nice dark rich yolk beautiful [Music] yogurt's still creamy inside he's a little olive nicoise this will work just as well with other black olives and then you're dressing drizzle that round gently beautiful that is a nicoise in heaven now tartine wow just a smell of those grilled walnuts that is beautiful a simple but very elegant tuna nicoise but delicious goat's cheese sandwich wonderful [Music] my vibrant and gutsy nisswa salad with that incredible anchovy and caper dressing served with a pear and goat's cheese tartine too good to let the french keep all to themselves [Music] a stunning prawn and cucumber salad with a spicy yogurt dressing a simply delicious anchovy dip and a sticky chocolate fridge cake that won't fail to revive a flag in family until he's keen to get in on the action [Music] what are your favorites a marshmallow and peanut fridge cake perfect for a picnic first things first you have to slowly melt the chocolate that's bad that's good i'm gonna break up the chocolate right in there next butter goes in couple tablespoons of golden syrup it's so good if we melt chocolate too quickly it starts to separate and destroy the best and safest way to melt chocolate is always use a bain-marie but i'm going to keep a really close eye on mine and heat it over a super low heat this stunning little cake has your favorites in there our digestives now put your hands in there and give them like that one at a time ago and crush what's the one thing that you love about a picnic i love eating outside especially on a nice summery day not so much in the winter no that's going to be the crunchy part of our fridge cake and it's called a fridge cake because it can sit in the fridge or you can freeze it now the peanuts in please can you use it without peanuts if you're allergic to peanuts oh you can do yeah definitely no what are these little babies cranberries cranberries from there marshmallows my favorite okay they're so bright aren't they why do you love marshmallows so much because they're so squishy all right give that a nice mix up chocolate is melting nicely okay i want you to pour that in and i'll mix it nice and gently slowly slowly slowly soon nice now touch more please good isn't it good give that a little mix with daddy please look they're all melty and nice and cool and gooey now we're going to line the tray so this is quite easy to make because um you don't have to bake it you just set it yeah i want you to start pushing it into the corners please with your fingers just laying out nice and flat ah it's all nice and marshmallow and oozy to get the spatula okay and look how delicious does that look really delicious i can eat it right now i couldn't because it's not set so when that sets okay it'll go nice and firm and then we can cut it into little bars little squares triangles triangles [Music] good but the important part of pushing it down is that we can slice it and the more we push the thinner we can slice okay good good [Music] fridge cake done now i'm gonna make the most amazing anchovy dip with vegetables and bread first cut slices of baguette and bake in the oven at 180 degrees c for six minutes or until crisp meanwhile roughly chop garlic and shallots and add to a food processor along with a tin of good quality anchovies sprinkle in some pitted black olives flat leaf parsley and drizzle in the reserved anchovy oil and a little olive oil blitz to a paste and add pepper then decant into a jar ready to transport serve with a handful of fresh baby carrots peppery radishes and your crisp baguette toast anchovy dip a portable and deliciously palatable alfresco treat [Music] now a spicy chili yogurt dressing with a prawn salad first things first i'd like you to make the dressing fish doesn't sauce smell like fishes so one and a half tablespoons of fish sauce two chilli i like this especially if you have it on the side of the pork little teaspoon of sugar oh that's it good in so four tablespoons of yogurt three four some zest in there why are you making it in a jam jar not a bowl well this is for a little picnic and it's a great way of transporting we squeeze the lime in there and then we put the lid on shake it and then i want you to shut it on tight [Music] come on it's a bit like a tummy see that sounds like my tummy only sometimes only sometimes thank you for that hi nick is you and the first time you have it's like a little thingy it's fresh salty citrusy but delicious now cucumber and the salad i want to get rid of all the seeds so if you just nice and gently peel the cucumber why do you feel it can you not eat the skin on it you can eat the skin but i want this salad to taste light and fresh you can use a knife for this too though can't you you can peel with a knife but a speed peeler takes off the slices nice and thinly so much quicker so much quicker that's why it's called a speed peeler looks better now looks a bit naked it does look a bit naked doesn't it now you get your spoon and see what happens a teaspoon just takes out all those seeds so whilst it sits in the dish it doesn't make the salad go all soft because that cucumber is nice and crunchy [Music] that's really good there you go so see where your knuckles are there that's what's always going to protect if you put that little finger out this little piggy boom comes off what did i tell you about daddy's knuckle that's the first place you cut off all the time there you go the next addition to our prawn salad is firm juicy baby gem lettuce look at the lettuce in half what about the butt the butts [Music] i'm keeping the butts on for now so when i slice it it stays together okay and then a little bit there we don't use okay when you prepare lettuce for picnic you never slice it too thinly okay otherwise it will it's good prawns already [Music] your tummy sauce is ready your dressing is ready take the lid off and the trick is you dress the bottom of your dish because i'm going to put the prawns on here to protect the lettuce get your cucumber i put my cucumber on and then finally that is okay now the salad's not gonna go soft why is that because it's not that it's not straight onto the dressing that's right what happens is we wrap this now and then we get to our picnic drizzle the sauce on top we mix it up we've got the dressing on the bottom and the dressing on top of the dressing on top that's right a little bit of tim film do you know the cling film trick i don't know the clip field trick yet no things fell over the top of the toilet what you don't understand it when you're my age oh you've been my age then well okay salad in the fridge with the dressing ready to go for a picnic this is my ultimate picnic dinner feast prawn and cucumber salad with a spicy yogurt dressing anchovy dip with crudites and the kids favorite chocolate marshmallow and peanut fridge cake

outstanding brunches i love brunch it's a great way of relaxing with friends and family not taking yourself or anything else too seriously and brunch dishes should reflect that spicy sweet or savoury anything goes and one of my all-time favorites a dish that always creates a stir is the daddy of all brunches steak sandwiches [Music] for me the secret of a great brunch is fun and casual fuss-free cooking and everyone helping themselves this is the ultimate steak sandwich you want the rolls royce of beef it has to be fill it now season it beautifully i like to open up the top of the peppermill to increase the size of the pepper in the steak so it gives that bit of heat nice little chunks you just roll now nicely all the way around now slice the garlic in half pan nice and hot olive oil in [Music] hold the steak and just place it into the pan don't drop it at the front of the pan we're going to tilt the pan forward to cook the back of the steak dual purpose now roll it back and sear underneath next my garlic and roast that garlic time fry that time i want to hear it we're not looking for a lot of color because you're going to dry out the fill it so just one end turn it back down and stir the other end in lift up your time place it on top of the garlic there lift up your fillet and sit there on top of your garlic butter in take a spoon tilt the pan gently lift up and baste i've got that scented garlic thyme flavor the steak is going to cook evenly because it's sat on a little a little bed in the oven for 8 to 10 minutes [Music] pan on for the relish you think of a steak sandwich you think of a sort of nice heated tomato relish to make the relish finely dice a red onion three finger rule one in front two behind through and chop wow next roughly chop a chili keeping the seeds in for extra heat start off with the olive oil into a pan onions chili generous with the olive oil i want a nice sort of rich silky relish from there take your tomatoes you can't just use red tomatoes but these yellow and red make the perfect combination now put your salt in pepper and then roast those tomatoes off take a wooden spoon and just sort of break them up once the skins blister the whole tomato just starts to release all that really nice sweet texture a little teaspoon of cherry vinegar gives that nice acidic balance the sweetness of the tomatoes turn down the gas and just let them sort of stew perfectly now a steak sandwich would not be complete unless it had the most amazing mustard mayonnaise simply add three tablespoons of mayonnaise to three teaspoons of whole grain mustard [Music] now i've got the reddish almost down to like a really nice jam now i want to make that relish a little bit more fragrant some basil slice it through sprinkle that basil in there [Music] beautiful look at this there she is my crown jewels time to take it out smell is incredible just based one more time to fill it touch is quite soft in the center so it's just coming up to mid-rare let it rest at the same time you cooked it it'll be nice and pink evenly throughout the steak to make my sandwich i'm going to char grill some sliced chipatta bread season it nicely just a little drizzle of olive oil i want to get that bread nice and crispy pan nice and hot bread in push it down smell is amazing that char sort of charcoal flavor once you've got those marks on the bread it just stops the bread from becoming soggy and look at this here it is stunning on slice it gently one beautiful slice wow it's nice and pink all the way through and the beef is so soft it's almost like slicing through butter let the knife do the work take a little bit of mayonnaise spread that the back of the spoon on both sides next lettuce take that beautiful slice of beef and then relish on top of that beef and just slice the sandwich in half beautiful now that's what i call a steak sandwich trust me sir the sublime sandwich for brunch and you'll put a smile on everyone's face [Music] next up my guide to buying the best beef and steaks if you want the ultimate brunch you can't do any better than start with a perfect steak and one man who really knows his steak is master butcher danny lidgate steak is my favorite type of meat and i think it's really good to enjoy different varieties of steak when choosing a steak that you want you need to look at exactly what you want out of it for my ultimate steak sandwich i used to fill it because it's the most tender the fillet does the least amount of work than all the other mussels it's tucked away in the rib cage this means that when you find a fillet it's incredibly soft like butter it's the most expensive but you get what you pay for there's a wide array of cuts to choose from all different in taste and texture if in doubt ask your butcher this would be the rump section where the rump comes from which is basically the back side take the bone out and what you're left with is a wonderful steak rum steak characteristically a little bit tougher than the sirloin or a little bit chewier than the ribeye but a really strong flavor for the steak again when frying rum look for the marbling try and get some fat covering on the steak you can always cut it off after it's cooked rumps one of the best value steaks i love it thinly cut them flesh fried in stir fries or simply marinated and whacked on the barbecue another great value but delicious cut is the hanger steak known as the butcher's cut because they often keep it for themselves it's great marinated and cooked quickly with the sirloin which is basically the back of the animal a nice sirloin like this really well marbled don't buy too lean so once the sirloin is trimmed up it looks something like this not too much fat but you need a little bit to cook in it next to the sirloin is the rib really popular now with rib eyes small nice really tender juicy steaks it's really especially good for barbecuing or grilling fantastic probably my favorite steak would be a rib eye rib eye is especially delicious because the marbling in the meat loads it with flavor for a full-on steak experience try the t-bone steak with a small tender fillet steak on one side of the bone and a larger flavor some sirloin on the other [Music] take your butcher's advice and you won't go wrong the final word has to go to danny when buying meat knowledge really is power so it's important to ask as many questions about the meat you're buying find out the breeds how it's aged and decide exactly what you want to do each particular job that should then give you a really amazing end product [Music] the great thing about brunch is there are no rules the only thing i insist on are it's got to be fuss-free easy to cook and so delicious it puts you in a good mood for the rest of the day and for me pancakes always hit the spot here are three of my deliciously different recipes certified to liven up your mornings first up fluffy blueberry and ricotta pancakes with yogurt [Music] start by adding 125 grams of plain flour a teaspoon of baking powder a pinch of salt a tablespoon of sugar then create a wet in the center separate two eggs and add the yolks keeping the

recipes guaranteed to bring some sparkle to your brunches incredible welcome back to my ultimate cookery course i'm teaching you all about brunches the most laid-back meal of the week and if you want to take it easy having the right equipment makes all the difference [Music] here's my guide to the best kitchen equipment everything you need to know about the basic kit that will get you cooking fantastic food chopping boards for brunch one of the most useful things is a great chopping board get the right one and it'll be your friend for life i prefer a sort of heavy duty one because they're so much more durable they can be flipped over the minute you want to go from vegetables to prepping fish or meat always keep a little jake off underneath that actually stops the board from sliding carefully wooden board by rubbing it with oil every so often any cooking oil will do wooden boards for me are always the best easy to clean and long lasting when you do wash your wooden board never let it stand in water or put it in the dishwasher as it may split buy the best you can afford and take good care of it [Music] for brunch i'd love something sweet and i've always been a fan of classic british crumpets with butter and jam but once you try cooking them at home you'll never want to buy them from shops again this is another great recipe you can stake your life on it's my homemade crumpet whether you're cooking for two three or even a gang some of the best brunch dishes are always the simplest these crumpets are absolutely delicious and it's a great end to a fantastic brunch first off we're gonna make the mix when you think of growing up the smell and the taste of amazing crumpet it never leaves you to make the mix the secret is to bring the milk up the ball but do not boil it the minute it boils turn it off and let it sit there now flour in a nice pinch of salt in now add half a teaspoon of bicarb that gives it aeration and really lifts the mixture up all those lovely little holes a nice pinch of sugar and then a teaspoon of yeast dry yeast now once the milk's boiled turn it off and add some warm water about 10 tablespoons 150 mil that cools down the milk but more importantly it doesn't destroy the yeast half of the milk in first stop and give that a really good mix now the rest of it [Music] [Music] you can just see that there's no lumps through there as it drips through the whisk now we're looking for it to double in size and get nice and light so pop in a warm place whilst you get on with the delicious topping [Music] beautiful strawberries but caramelized almost like a very quick strawberry jam hang on [Music] just slice these in half some sugar a couple of tablespoons we're gonna take the sugar to a nice light caramel it's just starting to change color now turn the gas down and we're gonna add the strawberries beautiful just sweating the strawberries down quickly and the caramels breaking down a wonderful glaze on the strawberries some lemon grated into the strawberries gives it that kind of freshness that really starts to break down the strawberries nice gas up smells incredible some lemon juice touch of balsamo vinegar and that gives it that really nice delicious tartness now off it goes as the strawberries start to cool down it will naturally thicken and set beautifully nice [Music] now for the crumpet it's almost doubled in size but be very careful you don't knock the bowl because it can sort of push out all that air it's aerated it's nice as light just see the texture she's ready to go to boil it here we go instead of making normal small crumpets i'm making a giant one ideal for sharing now turn the gas down you just start to see a traditional crumpet style cooking process we want those nice tiny little holes on top and that crispy crunchy base right now it's time to add the butter and just slide the butter down the bag that gives it a really nice nutty flavor at the end fish nice flip beautiful take that out take the jam spoon over the secret is for the juice to sort of run inside all those little holes think of that tartness of the balsamic vinegar the strawberries beautifully soft and almost pureed wrapped in that delicious caramel now finish that with a nice ball of creme fraiche let that sit there and that is an amazing way of finishing off a traditional brunch with something sweet something delicious and something you're dying to tuck into [Music] next my tricks of the trade and kitchen tips fruit can be a great healthy option for brunch and knowing how to get the best out of it can make all the difference first up how to peel and cut a mango the easy way holding your stalk end up cut either side of the stone cut all the way into the flesh making squares without cutting through the skin then turn it inside out and carefully cut your pieces off a great tip to check if a pineapple is ripe is to pull a leaf out from the top if it comes away easily it's ripe and ready for slicing my tip to get the flesh out of a kiwi is to simply cut the fruit in half and scoop it out with a teaspoon try it it really works if you have fruit that's not perfectly ripe the tip is to put a banana in a paper bag then add your unripe fruit put in a dark place and the banana will speed up the ripening process of the other fruit you can make a grapefruit puree to accompany a brunch pancake or a crumpet in a blender to clean it afterwards add a cup of warm water and run the machine for a few seconds empty out then simply repeat with a drop of washing up liquid then rinse [Music] follow my

quick supper fix spicy tuna fish cakes i love this recipe why because it turns this humble ingredient a can of tuna into something delicious just open up and drain the tuna into a sieve just lightly flake that don't press it too hard otherwise you'll dry out the tuna now these are water chestnuts just slice them nice and thin you can buy them anywhere any supermarket chestnuts in fresh ginger get rid of that rough skin on the outside by grating the ginger you get to get all that really nice sort of juice in take your spring onions and just slice on an angle i like the texture of the water chestnut with a spring onion or touch of fresh coriander lovely next remove the seeds from a chili to reduce its heat without losing any flavor and finely chilis in kaffir lime leaves roll them up nice and tight run your knife down the center once and just chop and that makes the fish cake nice and fragrant touch of salt a touch of pepper fish sauce just lightly season the tuna to bind all those wonderful ingredients two whole eggs and give that a nice little whisk and then add your eggs get your hands in there and start mixing get the mixture roll it hand to hand and the palm pat them down nicely to cook add a little ground oil to a hot pan at the face of a clock i'm going to go from 12 all the way around first one in these fish cakes only take a few minutes to cook so keeping track of the order they go in the pan means you know which one to turn first [Music] give the pad a nice gentle little shake make sure that nothing's sticking to the bottom spatula two fingers on top turn them over beautiful that crackling noise is something you always want because the tune's already cooked so we're just lightly frying them to get a nice crisp outside and gently take them out

cakes who would have thought something as delicious as that can come out of a can a simple supper in minutes that's so mouth-wateringly easy and delicious you're guaranteed to cook it again and again when it comes to simple cooking there are two basic bits of kit i'm never without that will save you time and effort in the kitchen a grater and a peeler the swivel peeler a stainless steel one absolutely incredible it's almost like a lifesaver in the kitchen because they are so quick so light swivel blade so we've got so much more flexibility actually go around the vegetable and we call it speed peeler in the professional kitchen because it does literally absolutely rapidly peels your vegetables you have minimal waste good peelers cost them a couple of quid and are great for everything from peeling veg to finely slicing cheese and making shards of chocolate a good comfortable grip and a sharp stainless steel blade ensures you'll always work fast [Music] the box grater is another great versatile kitchen tool and with its planes for course grating fine grating and super fine as well as blades for slicing it's perfect for everything from puring ginger and zesting lemons to shredding onions super small so they can caramelize in a flash and be sure to get a solid handle to hold it firm and it's got such volume inside it doesn't crush everything up so i always prefer to grate onto a tray or into a bowl so you don't have to move it again creating onto the board you've always got to lift it up and place it in so place the grater into a bowl and grate two simple but essential speedy bits of kit guaranteed to make your life in the kitchen easier [Music] bread is a brilliant base for delicious super fast lunches and suppers here are three of my deliciously simple recipes that transform a humble bit of bread into a gastronomic treat first up flatbreads with fennel and feta [Music] add olive oil to a flatbread [Music] then place in a hot frying pan and toast until crisp and golden on both sides these deliciously versatile breads are made without yeast and are available in good supermarkets and local middle eastern shops next thinly slice fresh fennel and scatter over the toasted flatbread then toast aromatic fennel seeds in a hot dry pan and sprinkle on top crumble over wonderfully tangy feta cheese [Music] finish with a drizzle of sweet and sticky pomegranate molasses bread transformed before your eyes flatbreads with fennel and feta simple delicious and ready to eat in minutes [Music] my next recipe that turns a hunk of bread into a stunning dish is bruschetta with garlic tomatoes capers and pecorino [Music] start by slicing a baguette diagonally to get a large surface area so it holds more of the delicious topping drizzle the bread with extra virgin olive oil then place it oil side down onto a scorching hot griddle when the bread is beautifully charred remove and rub with a pill clove of garlic pay attention to the edges next half sweet cherry tomatoes and rub the juices into the toasted garlic bread then simply crush on top [Music] next slice and scatter over tangy caper berries and use a veg peeler to add shavings of salty pecorino cheese [Music] finally drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and add a twist of black pepper fantastic fresh flavors in the flesh of a griddle pan toast has never tasted so good [Music] perfect for a simple light supper or an easy lunch my next dish is the cannellini bean crostini with anchovy and olive oil [Music] first for the topping heat olive oil in a frying pan add tin cannellini beans along with the juices once heated gently mash the beans with a fork then add sliced black olives roughly chop parsley and a splash of sherry vinegar season and leave on a gentle heat next half a

fantastic recipes proof that even when you're pressed for time you can still eat like a king incredible welcome back to my ultimate cookery course [Music] these are my perfect tv dinners next up my guide to getting the best ingredients for your money my shopping manta is very simple first rely on your senses make sure whatever you're buying it looks smells and really feels good and if you get the chance to taste it before you buy it then do it second is to recognize that knowledge is absolutely crucial the more you know about where your ingredients are from and how they produce the better so don't be scared ask lots of questions and learn and when you want a simple supper herbs are perfect to use in your cooking they add vibrancy an amazing depth of flavor and once you get the hang of them they are so quick and simple to use and one woman who really knows the chef's best friends is expert herb grower lorraine melton i love herbs i love the way you can cook with them i love the smell of them she's been growing an incredible array of herbs in the wet cambridgeshire countryside for over 20 years and can smell a bay from a basil at 50 paces we grow about 150 varieties of herbs it's always interesting to grow new varieties see what they taste like see what they smell like it gets a bit addictive after a while broadly speaking you get harder herbs and softer herbs softer herbs are things like parsley basil rocket coriander we grow um two main types of parsley we've got flat leaf parsley and curly parsley flavour-wise i think they're very similar although a lot of people would say that the flat leaf parsley has got a stronger more aromatic flavour this is your common basil sweet geneves this is a purple variety called ruben we do greek basil thai basil holy basil when you're looking for a basil you want a bright fresh basil nice leaves no blemishes and nice strong stems it's got a lot of oils in it and it's very strong smelling it just tastes a summer basil lorraine certainly knows her stuff and she's right soft herbs are delicate so for maximum flavor always use them at the end of cooking or simply add as they are to cold dishes here are my top five soft herbs that i could never live without [Music] basil as lorraine said it comes in many types all with an amazing sweet punch and flavor great blitzed in pestos sprinkled whole over mozzarella and showing its versatility it even makes a wonderful ice cream parsley beautifully earthy and intensely fresh use both the leaves and the stem for great depth of flavor in savoury dressing soups and salads coriander for an amazing hint of citrus often used in thai dishes coriander is perfect in curries and chutneys but it bruises easily so treat it with care tarragon a staple of french cooking this has long soft green leaves and a distinct anti-seed flavour great with chicken or in rich creamy sauces [Music] finally chervil both mild and sweet a perfect pairing with fish an incredible mix simply with melted butter for a quick source those are my favorite soft herbs what about the hard ones the harder ones tend to be a more woody plant things like thyme rosemary you've got your common time which is your ordinary general bog standard cooking time and then you've got things like lemon thyme we do an orange thyme which is actually one of my favorites it smells like thyme but it's got a deep sort of musky scent as well which is going to give you a slightly different flavor in your dish hard herbs like thyme can take more intense cooking than soft herbs so they're great in stews roast or pan frying choose the right one and you can add wonderful depth of flavor to your dishes here are my top five i use day in and day out rosemary amazingly robust with great bittersweet green leaves it's a classic paired with lamb delicious sprinkled over speciality breads like focaccia or great as toppings for fruity sorbets lorraine's favorite thyme a heady aromatic pungent herb which adds delicious flavor to a sunday roast it's amazing with wild mushrooms and is perfect in marinades oregano warm and full of delicious aromatic oils a staple of great italian dishes and perfect sprinkled on pizzas or in pasta sauces [Music] sage a strong tasting herb with a deliciously bitter flavor incredible in stuffings and with rich meats like pork or duck finally bay bitter sweet and spicy it's delicious simmered in soups stocks and risottos and just as good dried or fresh grown herbs is a lot easier than people think it is on winter boxes in balconies and it's great you can just open your window put your hand out and snip some off when you're out looking for hers make sure they're not nice and healthy no blemishes stems look strong they should just spring back it's a nice springy sort of herbs smell obviously is quite important not all things smell but obviously if you think it's one that's going to smell like lemon thyme you should have a nice fresh lemon scent and obviously the final one is taste you can tip a bit off and taste your herbs and you can see what they taste like them whether bored from a supermarket or pig from your window box herb's a great way to add fresh flavors to your dishes perfect for delicious simple suppers [Music] even if you got a super busy lifestyle it doesn't mean missing out on delicious desserts they just have to be simple to make when it comes to cooking at home puddings should always be a pleasure and never a chore and homemade puds are 100 guaranteed to impress my next recipe has only two main ingredients but simplicity doesn't mean food can't taste out of this world incredible griddle pineapple with spiced caramel if you're making a dessert for one or two it's gonna be quick and easy this sumptuous delicious griddle pineapple fits the bill perfectly pineapple a way of testing it's nice and ripe top of the leaves come out perfect ready to go always cut a pineapple with a serrated edge knife slice off the bottom turn it back over and slice the top part now keep that for later look at the core the center of the pineapple and slice down directly in half slice that in half take each quarter and slice them smells incredible lay down flat and just slice that core off so you've got this perfect sort of boat of pineapple slice underneath but stop as you get right at the end slicing around the skin will make the pineapple easier to eat but leaving it attached gives you more control as it cooks next heat a griddle pan as hot as you can start off in the corner and push it down so you really mark the pineapple two minutes on each side and then just turn them really nice color man look at that beautiful i'm gonna sprinkle them with a little touch of sugar that's gonna glaze them now slice the top take out these beautiful glazed slices of pineapple there next up the spiced caramel now start off with your pan nice and hot sprinkle four tablespoons of sugar in there just flatten it then add the seeds from a fresh vanilla pod in a small dusting of chinese fly spice never stir caramel let it sort of bubble and transform here she goes now i've got the color i want it that's the perfect color off with the gas in with the butter and then a couple of tablespoons of cream lovely and then give that a little whisk add the rest of your cream nice and just drip that spicy caramel over your pineapple [Music] wow simple elegant and seriously impressive griddle pineapple with spiced caramel a delicious treat all to yourself that tastes even better shared [Music] next my tricks of the trade and kitchen tips first up the proper way to chop fresh herbs to get maximum flavor chopping herbs the secret is to chop them not bruise them now basil this is a soft herb so treat it with some respect when people go mad chopping herbs all the goodness comes out on the board i want the goodness left inside the basil place them all inside one another with the largest leaf at the bottom and it's almost like rolling a cigar large one at the bottom small ones in the center and then look place them down together just roll them nice and gently don't bruise them step one rolled ready to slice sharp knife imperative fingers tucked in the bottom part of your knuckle is the guide between you and the herbs that there stops you from cutting your finger really important to get comfortable with a knife and just practice rolling the knife across the board and relaxing that wrist it's all in the wrist action so herbs up fingernails tucked underneath and just up and down up and down and there you have a chopped basil that's not bruised and smelling very fragra right coriander so you get the bunch of coriander hold it down and just lightly shave the leaves off the stalks bunch them up together and then just again let the knife do the work take the fingernails in and just chop once and once early don't hack it just chop it you can always identify when you've bruised the herb when you've removed the herbs off the board there's a big green patch mmm full of flavour and none of the goodness is left on the chopping board a great tip for using leftover herbs simply chop finely mix into butter roll up in clim film and freeze then when you want a herby hit cut into slices and melt over steaks chicken or veg asparagus is great for a simple supper to prepare always remove the lower woody stem by gently bending and the asparagus will snap at the perfect point then boil or steam and serve with a little of my herb butter for a cracking soft boiled egg simply place your egg in boiling water add a splash of vinegar and cook for exactly eight minutes then plunge into ice water the vinegar helps the shell peel off easily and the ice water stops the egg from cooking giving you the perfect runny yolk [Music] for fuss-free salad dressings simply add the ingredients into a jam jar screw the lid on tightly and shake to combine in seconds there's no need to wash up a whisk and the jar is ready made to store any leftovers follow my ultimate cookery course bursting with valuable lessons top tips and 100 recipes to stake your life on and you'll literally be cooking yourself into a better chef many of

unthinkable ah [ __ ] my mentor v said one week would not be enough to master this cuisine and i'm about to find out if she was right i'm in hanoi to cook a dinner for v and other top tutors i've met this week mr rice hi sir oh yeah good to see you how are you doing yeah well thank you this place looks amazing let me show you around here please it looks beautiful missy's duck's friend mr rice has given me the use of his fine dining restaurant a success is built on authentic vietnamese cooking and so it's a great honor the rush is beautiful yeah thank you who designed it i desire myself good job worryingly for me mr rice has invited along 30 discerning diners you got a huge huge challenge and you know tonight so many people here just waiting for your cooking and i say about six seven people very tough ready in three hours the restaurant will be full and i need to quickly get used to these unfamiliar surroundings well this is the kitchen yeah so everything here tonight's yours yeah gas burners and grill um completely different layout of a kitchen not like working with a gas ring burner um ten times more powerful a lot more instant so uh on the fly yet again tonight my menu will be drawn on everything i've learned i'm cooking pig seven ways so starting off with the pork and shrimp um fresh spring roll yeah yeah we served at room temperature be very careful uh pig's ear salad blanched in a nice sort of spicy broth uh barbecued pork skewer and it's drilled over charcoal then we're going to go to the sweet and sour pork ribs okay after that we've got the pigsta curry after that caramelized pork belly finished with fish sauce after that the pork noodle broth let's go bye-bye my nose to town menu is a tall order i start with barbecue pork skewers inspired by missy's duck the shoulder of pork sliced thinly marinated and then cooked on charcoal now that doesn't look anywhere near like missy's ducks it's times like this i wish you'd just give me the recipe properly i think it's secretly because she had a massive crush on me and she had visions of her and i set up a restaurant together next for my pig feast a curry that i hope will satisfy the vietnamese appetite for texture normally when we use trotters at home in the uk we bone them out and stuff them but these are cooked on the bone and very gelatinous nice fresh turmeric a little bit of garlic ginger fish sauce a little bit of fermented rice wine vinegar almost like a sort of light spicy curry the pressure is on and already i've made my first mistake so this is my broth remember my singing ordeal down the river i'm just struggling for that nice sort of lightly sort of pinkish color i'm beginning to wish i'd kept things simple i've got one dish seared out [ __ ] 400 things to do [ __ ] out downstairs hanoi's most accomplished foodies have arrived along with my mentors mrs duck and madame v all here to pass judgement on my efforts i think it's a big challenging for him because something completely new and very different to what you have at home bee's premonition is coming true i'm having a kitchen nightmare i know the broth's gone cloudy so i turned up the gas and by rapidly reducing down some strength it's gone cloudy here are the sweetness our ribs i want to put them in the oven but they don't have ovens here so everything's going to be cooked on top okay pour trotters broth ribs i think now he's in control he's in control now because it's no salty no yearling from the kitchen yes oh [ __ ] how [ __ ] bollocks oh [ __ ] that'd kill me if you saw it watch out please guys come on yo go out of the way please everybody everybody the spectators by now i should be serving up but i'm nowhere near ready skewers please okay yeah i need color on there i need color come on please yeah charcoal that's what gives a color let's go [Music] it's gone 7 30 and hanoi's finest have been waiting to eat for over half an hour i think in 20 minutes to be here all the foods will be here i should run up to the kitchen and kick him ass i'm starving i need to eat something and then unless you know i'm waiting for a long time skewers please turn them over turn over more color please come on hero yeah finally my dishes come together the broth is nice and clear now i've clarified it some minced pork and egg white to get it nice and clear my homage to missy's duck is almost ready to be served fingers crossed madame duck style sesame seed and at the last minute i've put together my pig's ear salad don't take anything until i say don't take anything till they're [ __ ] finished please okay let's go please gently gently gently gently no no no no look no stop yeah that one goes on there right you come here stand here one bowl hold the tray tight yep and two let's go [Music] at last dinner is served this has been one of the toughest nights of my cooking career [Music] i think what i want to say is this is very brave that was a nightmare struggled um across the whole three hours i'd like to think i'd done it justice but i left myself a little bit short [Music] but my ordeal isn't over yet i need to face my mentors to find out if i've impressed them how are you doing recognize you with no hats on how are the pig sweaters um i'm i'm i'm not fan of that damn what a shame i think it's a little too much caramel sauce ready too sweet for you yeah wow i like you uh i like the pizza or the pizza yeah it's beautiful it's so crunchy i love that passion chewy crunchy crispy soft and silky got it the the pork chocha the pig trotter is perfect pigs is the most difficult meat to cook so it's really really impressive what you have done with that the text is too strong and the color is too dark i think it's very difficult to do very authentic i think this one i can eat it for no problem madame look at you finally i want to know what the dying of nose-to-tail cooking things of my efforts oh my goodness me what happened huh that's amazing before you before you have basically been very pleased yes the best the real soda on skewers on the charcoal well if it wasn't for you this shoulder wouldn't have tasted as good as it did trust me i'm so glad that you like that one i'm gonna say good to see you mr ice as always so vietnamese people is very hard to please so but tonight gordon i think he does well he pass it for me one of the most thrilling seven days i've ever spent in my cooking career honestly if you want to eat well get rid of your fridge it forces you to buy ingredients twice a day and cook in a completely different way challenging week yet for me one of the most inspirational big time crispy crunchy chewy soft and silky right airport i've escaped to vietnam and promised one of the best cooks in the country that i'll get to grips with this unique cuisine in just a week [Music] i'm hot footing out of ho chi minh city and flying 1500 kilometers north to the capital hanoi it's a huge learning curve for me it'd be very ignorant from a chess point of view not to embrace their understanding of their waste nothing and the everything hanoi is a communist stronghold traditionally this part of the country has a no waste culture they are experts in nose-to-tail eating and one the taurus female chef has made a reputation cooking just one ingredient [Music] now this lady's a bit of a hard ass bit of a legend i'm in hanoi for two days and i'm here for inspiration i'm gonna get in there see what she's up to and hopefully yeah like a magpie steal some ideas what she's doing jesus where's the boss hello how are you good to see you what's up jayden uh jordan um your name man luckily for me a local restaurant owner has come to my rescue madame quack h o i oh man of course you said quack duck quack quack quack and you are my my name's rice call me quan mr rice and mrs duck yes so where's mr p king yeah i don't want to piss her off yeah i want to keep on a good side all right yeah i heard she has a ferocious temper that's it all right three cleavers by the side of her very sad very sad yeah yeah how many ducks a day does she sell how many husbands have she killed uh one missy ducker spent 30 years perfecting her menu but before i get to taste it she wants me to meet her key ingredient out back what are these little babies here how old are they they must be days old uh about 10 days ten days old how old are these four months or five minutes four months old so which ones we're gonna use first this is the oldest one and this one in order to find the plumpest bird mrs duck has devised a unique test why are we done can you can you hear the sound yeah yeah drama the duck to the ground yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but i'm quite never touched just listen just put this down all right so she's waiting she's listening for a weighted yeah heavy sounds that sounds good i'm beginning to think missy's duck is quackers but her dish is famous throughout hanoi so she must be doing something right so this is how she prepares a duck every day yes and it's important to bleed the ducks otherwise it's going to spoil the texture of the meat i get that but why is she cutting it there because here just stay away from the stomach you may get the bad food from stomach into the plant yes yeah she believes in slaughtering them just before she started cooking them so he's done that fresh does it all the way fresh like that just close it and then cook yes yes houses and everything the duck is the the the goddess of her house the duck is the goddess of the house he says very quick anything to keep her happy now the dirty work is over missy's duck wants to give me a lesson in nose-to-tail butchery straight down in the middle yeah pass the cleaver to her see one that takes you hot she wants she wants to now teach me how to sharpen a knife yeah this is duck yeah straight off okay off yep it's amazing i've never actually slaughtered one in the kitchen taking this feathers off and butchered it from there is there anything of the duck that she never uses you see that yeah other glands that's the bile the bile very bitter yeah if that bursts over the duck it ruins the texture no it's smelly i'm enjoying myself i'm about to learn mrs duck's sweet and sour sauce but all of a sudden she's become tight-lipped so nobody knows this recipe values nobody knows okay her life so not easy to give her life i'm not asking to marry her i'm asking for the recipe it's you and i look at me this is duck missy's stuff um why are you being such a hard house yeah when i've just plucked your ducks she'll tell you even her husband doesn't know about that serious oh my god you huh you're one-off she's unique she's like a fine bottle of wire and they only produce one bottle of weed she's amazing huge source of inspiration more importantly she knows her stuff i mean big time so she hasn't focused on 25 30 dishes she's just focused on a unique way with duck she shows no mercy straight in there nothing squeamish about missy's duck is there a little bit [ __ ] scared to be honest while her signature dish cooks i'm gonna sample the rest of mrs duck's menu so many different ways different sort of stars of cooking the duck it's amazing do you want to try the hat if you want to ah easier nice and tender that's good that's very good that's the that's nice it's got a leathery liver texture to it now for the main event the bbq duck is ready it says mix with the marinade and then on top of the charcoal grill that's great and then the fan obviously to intensify the heat yeah okay nice that is delicious and she's managed to use everything even there as a piece of the leg it's it's amazing you

the more flavoursome it becomes marinating the lamb first chillies we're going to use a mixture of red and green take off the tops and just slice in garlic crushed don't worry about chopping these ultra fine just get it in there cooking for up to three hours everything sort of blends and almost sort of purees itself together smoked paprika goes brilliantly well with the chilis two teaspoons in a touch of dried oregano some little cumin seeds the blend and the fragrance that they give out is extraordinary they release a little oil as well and helps to tenderize the lamb a touch of salt pepper cinnamon that sort of sweetens up the lamb olive oil just a tablespoon and the olive oil helps to sort of stick all those wonderful spices to the lamb jump in just start really rubbing at this stage you can leave the lamb to marinade for anything from half an hour to overnight allowing the spices to really penetrate the meat giving amazing results when you tuck in delicious vegetables carrots and onions and that's it sliced secret slicing vegetables from braising is not getting too thin you slice the onions too thin they burn you've got that horrible char taste on that slow braised braising it's just a chef's term that means cooking in liquid on a low heat making the meat incredibly moist and beautifully tender so the secret of braising is having a really nice thick durable pan get that nice and hot just a touch of olive oil lamb in hold the bone because you're in control then into the pan i want that white fat to start rendering so it'll add more fat therefore making it a lot more flavoursome as it braises chili's cinnamon in mix that up and don't be scared you're not burning this you're sort of searing the lamb shanks and this is the important part right at the very beginning we're getting the colour on the lamb which washes off as it braises in the oven so be generous with that color vegetables in wow and then a couple of baileys so now you lift the lamb up and get the lamb sat on top of the vegetables now just glaze the pan with red wine the glazing means that you're you're cleaning the bottom of the pan and you're getting that amazing flavor washed off and lifted up into that sauce can really transform that dish always delays then bring to the boil and cook for about 10 minutes to reduce the wines reduce down by half now for the stock bring that stock back up to the ball and then into the oven now don't cover it when you cover it all the condensation comes off the lid your lamb becomes gray all this effort and that exciting spice gets washed away no lid and in the oven for three hours a slow cook on a low heat of 160 degrees gives the spices time to work and transform the meat so it's mouthwateringly tender now look at those out on to a plate you can just see that meat sliding down juicy and incredibly tender grab it by the the shank roll around that rich delicious sauce look at and get that sauce nice beautiful just get some mint don't chop it just pick that fresh mint and let it snow and there you go a very spicy delicious melting of the mouth lamb shank amazing red mullet with sweet chilli sauce cooking is about being adventurous and having the confidence to go off piste and being a little bit more daring so when you start combining peanuts chili flakes and this amazing fish red mullet trust me you're in for an amazing treat we're gonna make a really nice light sweet chilli sauce first off your chili off with the top in half and those seeds inside are very powerful incredibly hot but full of flavor garlic two cloves of garlic slice the garlic nice and thin so it helps to puree the chilies in the pest and water garlic in such a salt a little touch of sugar in and then start grinding push down first [Music] the salt and the sugar really helps to puree the chili and the garlic fish sauce always a base to a chili sauce two tablespoons in and a touch of rice wine vinegar fish sauce gives it the saltiness the vinegar gives it a nice acidic wake up three tablespoons of olive oil nice mix that up beautiful look at the colors incredible now spring onions i want the texture and the crunch spring onions in the coriander slice it once in fresh lime and that goes brilliantly with the red mullet just really wakes up the chili the garlic and reminds the sauce that we're serving with fish now taste wow that's delicious look at that beautiful the longer that chili sauce sits there the better it gets now for the peanuts and chili that's gonna coat the top of the red mullet peanuts in salt in that helps to really grind the peanuts down some beautiful dried chili flakes creates a nice sort of warm heat i'm using fresh chili for the sauce but dried chili flakes for the coating which will really crunch up when cooking just a little bit of coriander mix the coriander in to the peanuts and look i like them quite textured i don't want them too small as a powder otherwise they'll burn but crushed lightly to coat the fish with the chili and peanut seasoning in a separate bowl beat two eggs along with a splash of fish sauce take your fillet lay in your red mullet dip it in shake up your peanuts and then in and make sure you push that down cover that red mullet up beautiful now make sure that pan is really nice and piping hot if you put the fish in and the pan's cold all those wonderful peanuts and chilli just gonna slide off the fish so we need to sear it in and get it nice and crisp in and lay away from you beautiful [Music] if the pan starts getting a little bit too hot get your olive oil and just place another teaspoon of olive oil around the outside so it starts to heat up as it hits the center and it really helps to stay so much more in control and turn nice and gently we want that nice sort of toasted sauteed crispness which adds a really lovely flavor tilt the pan and just baste the top of the red mullet with that really nice piping hot olive oil you've got that really nice roasted crunch and it goes brilliantly with that soft sweetness of that fish inside get off and just leave them sitting in there and finish with lime and just go over each one now we'll take them out and the sauce will touch on the bottom and the tail of each fish now to round that off serving some fragrant rice sauteed broccoli amazing and there you have a delicious peanut and crusted red mullet with a wonderful sweet chilli sauce cooking with chilis isn't all about blow your head off heat this dish uses the exciting taste of a chili but has a deliciously elegant and subtle flavor spicy beef salad chillies if you use them confidently they can really add a new dimension to the style of cooking but the real trick is finding that balance of flavors that really suits you because that's the most important part so this is the most amazing sirloin you can see it's got that wonderful marble for me the secret behind this is cooking it quickly season the steaks generously salt and pepper push that seasoning in to the sirloin take the soda out the fridge literally 20 minutes before you want to cook them so it gets up to room temperature they cook more evenly but more importantly you can actually season right inside the steak this little bit of fat down here season that as well because that is what we want to roast and get that really nice and rendered olive oil in a tablespoon roll that round as it starts to smoke in with the steaks into the pan and lay away again into the pan and lay away if you don't hear that noise the minute those steaks hit the pan don't put them in so the secret now is getting that color on the steak turning it once and once only and cooking it for two and a half minutes each side what i want to do is to get that bit of fat rendered so it adds a lot more flavor just hold the steak down like that and that starts to melt the fat which makes it so much more tender there should be no white fat left anywhere turn them over really important to have that steak up to room temperature before you start cooking it so the inside is nice and warm so we spend less time in the pan and more time cooling down really important now two fingers touch it goes in says rare i'm happy for them to be rare because by the time i let them rest they're gonna go back to medium rare it'll continue cooking out onto a plate and let them rest one two let's get my juices over don't waste that really important next the spicy dressing take the seeds out of the chili to reduce the heat by rubbing it in your hands and tapping until the seeds fall out cut it in half and just chop it in garlic and chilli works brilliantly a quick way of peeling it get your knife and just slam it down pops out very very quickly in a little touch of salt rub start going around in circles first you'll see it pureeing nice clear that off now we've got the heat in there from the chilli and that richness from the garlic two teaspoons of palm sugar this is where it starts to have that nice sweet sour effect fish sauce fresh lime this is a simple fresh chili dressing and it was something i fell in love with in vietnam and cambodia because it was just so easy give that a little mix and dissolve the sugar quick taste wow right vegetables a great fuss-free way to get super thin ribbons of carrot is to use a veg peeler when they're that thin they take the vinaigrette so much better and radishes just slice them down at an angle lovely to give another dimension to the salad i'm gonna use a banana shallot they are incredibly mellow very sweet across just chop up the shallot and mix that through want some sweetness in there now little vine tomatoes slice them in half tomatoes in shallot radish carrots and tomatoes next peel and slice cucumber chopped spring onions and shred baby gem lettuce and then finally get some fresh mint there's young men so you don't need to take all those stalks off all you do is hold the bunch upside down and then take it for a little trim and just chop that once through look at that nice minted salad a couple of tablespoons of dressing don't flood the cellar with the dressing we can always add but we can't take it away now really mix that dressing in there make sure all that chili and garlic and palm sugar wraps around that salad beautiful onto the plate the steak's rested it's now nice and medium rare that little bit of fat we don't want to find that in the salad just slice that off that serves its purpose it's kept that steak nice and moist just slice going with the grain it's almost like slicing through butter and look inside beautiful pink you slice the beef too thinly then it goes stone cold and more importantly all the goodness runs out of it nice thick slices get the beef and start placing it around the salad take a little teaspoon of your dressing the rest of your salad sip that on top we'll finish it off with some toasted peanuts peanuts in now those nuts are really toasted nuts on get another pan and just crush once they've cooled down just run them through with a knife they can hear how crunchy they are another texture another taste the salad and then from there sprinkle and then finally take that just finish it with a little tablespoon of that sauce and there is one tasty very well textured spicy beef salad [Music]

outstanding brunches i love brunch it's a great way of relaxing with friends and family not taking yourself or anything else too seriously and brunch dishes should reflect that spicy sweet or savoury anything goes and one of my all-time favorites a dish that always creates a stir is the daddy of all brunches steak sandwiches [Music] for me the secret of a great brunch is fun and casual fuss-free cooking and everyone helping themselves this is the ultimate steak sandwich you want the rolls royce of beef it has to be fill it now season it beautifully i like to open up the top of the peppermill to increase the size of the pepper in the steak so it gives that bit of heat nice little chunks you just roll now nicely all the way around now slice the garlic in half pan nice and hot olive oil in [Music] hold the steak and just place it into the pan don't drop it at the front of the pan we're going to tilt the pan forward to cook the back of the steak dual purpose now roll it back and sear underneath next my garlic and roast that garlic time fry that time i want to hear it we're not looking for a lot of color because you're going to dry out the fill it so just one end turn it back down and stir the other end in lift up your time place it on top of the garlic there lift up your fillet and sit there on top of your garlic butter in take a spoon tilt the pan gently lift up and baste i've got that scented garlic thyme flavor the steak is going to cook evenly because it's sat on a little a little bed in the oven for 8 to 10 minutes [Music] pan on for the relish you think of a steak sandwich you think of a sort of nice heated tomato relish to make the relish finely dice a red onion three finger rule one in front two behind through and chop wow next roughly chop a chili keeping the seeds in for extra heat start off with the olive oil into a pan onions chili generous with the olive oil i want a nice sort of rich silky relish from there take your tomatoes you can't just use red tomatoes but these yellow and red make the perfect combination now put your salt in pepper and then roast those tomatoes off take a wooden spoon and just sort of break them up once the skins blister the whole tomato just starts to release all that really nice sweet texture a little teaspoon of cherry vinegar gives that nice acidic balance the sweetness of the tomatoes turn down the gas and just let them sort of stew perfectly now a steak sandwich would not be complete unless it had the most amazing mustard mayonnaise simply add three tablespoons of mayonnaise to three teaspoons of whole grain mustard [Music] now i've got the reddish almost down to like a really nice jam now i want to make that relish a little bit more fragrant some basil slice it through sprinkle that basil in there [Music] beautiful look at this there she is my crown jewels time to take it out smell is incredible just based one more time to fill it touch is quite soft in the center so it's just coming up to mid-rare let it rest at the same time you cooked it it'll be nice and pink evenly throughout the steak to make my sandwich i'm going to char grill some sliced chipatta bread season it nicely just a little drizzle of olive oil i want to get that bread nice and crispy pan nice and hot bread in push it down smell is amazing that char sort of charcoal flavor once you've got those marks on the bread it just stops the bread from becoming soggy and look at this here it is stunning on slice it gently one beautiful slice wow it's nice and pink all the way through and the beef is so soft it's almost like slicing through butter let the knife do the work take a little bit of mayonnaise spread that the back of the spoon on both sides next lettuce take that beautiful slice of beef and then relish on top of that beef and just slice the sandwich in half beautiful now that's what i call a steak sandwich trust me sir the sublime sandwich for brunch and you'll put a smile on everyone's face [Music] next up my guide to buying the best beef and steaks if you want the ultimate brunch you can't do any better than start with a perfect steak and one man who really knows his steak is master butcher danny lidgate steak is my favorite type of meat and i think it's really good to enjoy different varieties of steak when choosing a steak that you want you need to look at exactly what you want out of it for my ultimate steak sandwich i used to fill it because it's the most tender the fillet does the least amount of work than all the other mussels it's tucked away in the rib cage this means that when you find a fillet it's incredibly soft like butter it's the most expensive but you get what you pay for there's a wide array of cuts to choose from all different in taste and texture if in doubt ask your butcher this would be the rump section where the rump comes from which is basically the back side take the bone out and what you're left with is a wonderful steak rum steak characteristically a little bit tougher than the sirloin or a little bit chewier than the ribeye but a really strong flavor for the steak again when frying rum look for the marbling try and get some fat covering on the steak you can always cut it off after it's cooked rumps one of the best value steaks i love it thinly cut them flesh fried in stir fries or simply marinated and whacked on the barbecue another great value but delicious cut is the hanger steak known as the butcher's cut because they often keep it for themselves it's great marinated and cooked quickly with the sirloin which is basically the back of the animal a nice sirloin like this really well marbled don't buy too lean so once the sirloin is trimmed up it looks something like this not too much fat but you need a little bit to cook in it next to the sirloin is the rib really popular now with rib eyes small nice really tender juicy steaks it's really especially good for barbecuing or grilling fantastic probably my favorite steak would be a rib eye rib eye is especially delicious because the marbling in the meat loads it with flavor for a full-on steak experience try the t-bone steak with a small tender fillet steak on one side of the bone and a larger flavor some sirloin on the other [Music] take your butcher's advice and you won't go wrong the final word has to go to danny when buying meat knowledge really is power so it's important to ask as many questions about the meat you're buying find out the breeds how it's aged and decide exactly what you want to do each particular job that should then give you a really amazing end product [Music] the great thing about brunch is there are no rules the only thing i insist on are it's got to be fuss-free easy to cook and so delicious it puts you in a good mood for the rest of the day and for me pancakes always hit the spot here are three of my deliciously different recipes certified to liven up your mornings first up fluffy blueberry and ricotta pancakes with yogurt

recipes guaranteed to bring some sparkle to your brunches incredible welcome back to my ultimate cookery course i'm teaching you all about brunches the most laid-back meal of the week and if you want to take it easy having the right equipment makes all the difference [Music] here's my guide to the best kitchen equipment everything you need to know about the basic kit that will get you cooking fantastic food chopping boards for brunch one of the most useful things is a great chopping board get the right one and it'll be your friend for life i prefer a sort of heavy duty one because they're so much more durable they can be flipped over the minute you want to go from vegetables to prepping fish or meat always keep a little jake off underneath that actually stops the board from sliding carefully wooden board by rubbing it with oil every so often any cooking oil will do wooden boards for me are always the best easy to clean and long lasting when you do wash your wooden board never let it stand in water or put it in the dishwasher as it may split buy the best you can afford and take good care of it [Music] for brunch i'd love something sweet and i've always been a fan of classic british crumpets with butter and jam but once you try cooking them at home you'll never want to buy them from shops again this is another great recipe you can stake your life on it's my homemade crumpet whether you're cooking for two three or even a gang some of the best brunch dishes are always the simplest these crumpets are absolutely delicious and it's a great end to a fantastic brunch first off we're gonna make the mix when you think of growing up the smell and the taste of amazing crumpet it never leaves you to make the mix the secret is to bring the milk up the ball but do not boil it the minute it boils turn it off and let it sit there now flour in a nice pinch of salt in now add half a teaspoon of bicarb that gives it aeration and really lifts the mixture up all those lovely little holes a nice pinch of sugar and then a teaspoon of yeast dry yeast now once the milk's boiled turn it off and add some warm water about 10 tablespoons 150 mil that cools down the milk but more importantly it doesn't destroy the yeast half of the milk in first stop and give that a really good mix now the rest of it [Music] [Music] you can just see that there's no lumps through there as it drips through the whisk now we're looking for it to double in size and get nice and light so pop in a warm place whilst you get on with the delicious topping [Music] beautiful strawberries but caramelized almost like a very quick strawberry jam hang on [Music] just slice these in half some sugar a couple of tablespoons we're gonna take the sugar to a nice light caramel it's just starting to change color now turn the gas down and we're gonna add the strawberries beautiful just sweating the strawberries down quickly and the caramels breaking down a wonderful glaze on the strawberries some lemon grated into the strawberries gives it that kind of freshness that really starts to break down the strawberries nice gas up smells incredible some lemon juice touch of balsamo vinegar and that gives it that really nice delicious tartness now off it goes as the strawberries start to cool down it will naturally thicken and set beautifully nice [Music] now for the crumpet it's almost doubled in size but be very careful you don't knock the bowl because it can sort of push out all that air it's aerated it's nice as light just see the texture she's ready to go to boil it here we go instead of making normal small crumpets i'm making a giant one ideal for sharing now turn the gas down you just start to see a traditional crumpet style cooking process we want those nice tiny little holes on top and that crispy crunchy base right now it's time to add the butter and just slide the butter down the bag that gives it a really nice nutty flavor at the end fish nice flip beautiful take that out take the jam spoon over the secret is for the juice to sort of run inside all those little holes think of that tartness of the balsamic vinegar the strawberries beautifully soft and almost pureed wrapped in that delicious caramel now finish that with a nice ball of creme fraiche let that sit there and that is an amazing way of finishing off a traditional brunch with something sweet something delicious and something you're dying to tuck into [Music] next my tricks of the trade and kitchen tips fruit can be a great healthy option for brunch and knowing how to get the best out of it can make all the difference first up how to peel and cut a mango the easy way holding your stalk end up cut either side of the stone cut all the way into the flesh making squares without cutting through the skin then turn it inside out and carefully cut your pieces off a great tip to check if a pineapple is ripe is to pull a leaf out from the top if it comes away easily it's ripe and ready for slicing my tip to get the flesh out of a kiwi is to simply cut the fruit in half and scoop it out with a teaspoon try it it really works if you have fruit that's not perfectly ripe the tip is to put a banana in a paper bag then add your unripe fruit put in a dark place and the banana will speed up the ripening process of the other fruit you can make a grapefruit puree to accompany a brunch pancake or a crumpet in a blender to clean it afterwards add a cup of warm water and run the machine for a few seconds empty out then simply repeat with a drop of washing up liquid then rinse [Music] follow my

want to cook and eat time and time again and soon you'll be on your way to becoming a kitchen demon my first dish keeps it simple but delivers big time on flavour so it's sure to become a regular quick supper fix spicy tuna fish cakes i love this recipe why because it turns this humble ingredient a can of tuna into something delicious just open up and drain the tuna into a sieve just lightly flake that don't press it too hard otherwise you'll dry out the tuna now these are water chestnuts just slice them nice and thin you can buy them anywhere any supermarket chestnuts in fresh ginger get rid of that rough skin on the outside by grating the ginger you get to get all that really nice sort of juice in take your spring onions and just slice on an angle i like the texture of the water chestnut with a spring onion or touch of fresh coriander lovely next remove the seeds from a chili to reduce its heat without losing any flavor and finely chilis in kaffir lime leaves roll them up nice and tight run your knife down the center once and just chop and that makes the fish cake nice and fragrant touch of salt a touch of pepper fish sauce just lightly season the tuna to bind all those wonderful ingredients two whole eggs and give that a nice little whisk and then add your eggs get your hands in there and start mixing get the mixture roll it hand to hand and the palm pat them down nicely to cook add a little ground oil to a hot pan at the face of a clock i'm going to go from 12 all the way around first one in these fish cakes only take a few minutes to cook so keeping track of the order they go in the pan means you know which one to turn first [Music] give the pad a nice gentle little shake make sure that nothing's sticking to the bottom spatula two fingers on top turn them over beautiful that crackling noise is something you always want because the tune's already cooked so we're just lightly frying them to get a nice crisp outside and gently take them out smell incredible let them sit there i'm gonna make a really nice delicious simple dipping sauce start off a little pinch of sugar fish sauce two tablespoons that gives it the saltiness one tablespoon of rice wine vinegar and some fresh lime juice squeeze all that lime in there your fresh coriander lots of coriander and in give that a little mix and then you have the most amazing spicy tuna fish cakes who would have thought something as delicious as that can come out of a can a simple supper in minutes that's so mouth-wateringly easy and delicious you're guaranteed to cook it again and again when it comes to simple cooking there are two basic bits of kit i'm never without that will save you time and effort in the kitchen a grater and a peeler the swivel peeler a stainless steel one absolutely incredible it's almost like a lifesaver in the kitchen because they are so quick so light swivel blade so we've got so much more flexibility actually go around the vegetable and we call it speed peeler in the professional kitchen because it does literally absolutely rapidly peels your vegetables you have minimal waste good peelers cost them a couple of quid and are great for everything from peeling veg to finely slicing cheese and making shards of chocolate a good comfortable grip and a sharp stainless steel blade ensures you'll always work fast [Music] the box grater is another great versatile kitchen tool and with its planes for course grating fine grating and super fine as well as blades for slicing it's perfect for everything from puring ginger and zesting lemons to shredding onions super small so they can caramelize in a flash and be sure to get a solid handle to hold it firm and it's got such volume inside it doesn't crush everything up so i always prefer to grate onto a tray or into a bowl so you don't have to move it again creating onto the board you've always got to lift it up and place it in so place the grater into a bowl and grate two simple but essential speedy bits of kit guaranteed to make your life in the kitchen easier [Music] bread is a brilliant base for delicious super fast lunches and suppers here are three of my deliciously simple recipes that transform a humble bit of bread into a gastronomic treat first up flatbreads with fennel and feta [Music] add olive oil to a flatbread [Music] then place in a hot frying pan and toast until crisp and golden on both sides these deliciously versatile breads are made without yeast and are available in good supermarkets and local middle eastern shops next thinly slice fresh fennel and scatter over the toasted flatbread then toast aromatic fennel seeds in a hot dry pan and sprinkle on top crumble over wonderfully tangy feta cheese [Music] finish with a drizzle of sweet and sticky pomegranate molasses bread transformed before your eyes flatbreads with fennel and feta simple delicious and ready to eat in minutes [Music] my next recipe that turns a hunk of bread into a stunning dish is bruschetta with garlic tomatoes capers and pecorino [Music] start by slicing a baguette diagonally to get a large surface area so it holds more of the delicious topping drizzle the bread with extra virgin olive oil then place it oil side down onto a scorching hot griddle when the bread is beautifully charred remove and rub with a pill clove of garlic pay attention to the edges next half sweet cherry tomatoes and rub the juices into the toasted garlic bread then simply crush on top [Music] next slice and scatter over tangy caper berries and use a veg peeler to add shavings of salty pecorino cheese [Music] finally drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and add a twist of black pepper fantastic fresh flavors in the flesh of a griddle pan toast has never tasted so good [Music] perfect for a simple light supper or an easy lunch my next dish is the cannellini bean crostini with anchovy and olive oil [Music] first for the topping heat olive oil in a frying pan add tin cannellini beans along with the juices once heated gently mash the beans with a fork then add sliced black olives roughly chop parsley and a splash of sherry vinegar season and leave on a gentle heat next half a festive batter and splash with extra virgin olive oil heat a griddle pan until smoking and toast the bread all side down pressing it into the pan to char evenly to serve top the toasted chipatta with a cannali bean mixture and finish with chopped anchovies packed with bold flavors so easy you can always make it blindfolded ready in under 10 minutes but eaten in seconds three different breads three fantastic recipes proof that even when you're pressed for time you can still eat like a king incredible welcome back to my ultimate cookery course [Music] these are my perfect tv dinners next up my guide to getting the best ingredients for your money my shopping manta is very simple first rely on your senses make sure whatever you're buying it looks smells and really feels good and if you get the chance to taste it before you buy it then do it second is to recognize that knowledge is absolutely crucial the more you know about where your ingredients are from and how they produce the better so don't be scared ask lots of questions and learn and when you want a simple supper herbs are perfect to use in your cooking they add vibrancy an amazing depth of flavor and once you get the hang of them they are so quick and simple to use and one woman who really knows the chef's best friends is expert herb grower lorraine melton i love herbs i love the way you can cook with them i love the smell of them she's been growing an incredible array of herbs in the wet cambridgeshire countryside for over 20 years and can smell a bay from a basil at 50 paces we grow about 150 varieties of herbs it's always interesting to grow new varieties see what they taste like see what they smell like it gets a bit addictive after a while broadly speaking you get harder herbs and softer herbs softer herbs are things like parsley basil rocket coriander we grow um two main types of parsley we've got flat leaf parsley and curly parsley flavour-wise i think they're very similar although a lot of people would say that the flat leaf parsley has got a stronger more aromatic flavour this is your common basil sweet geneves this is a purple variety called ruben we do greek basil thai basil holy basil when you're looking for a basil you want a bright fresh basil nice leaves no blemishes and nice strong stems it's got a lot of oils in it and it's very strong smelling it just tastes a summer basil lorraine certainly knows her stuff and she's right soft herbs are delicate so for maximum flavor always use them at the end of cooking or simply add as they are to cold dishes here are my top five soft herbs that i could never live without [Music] basil as lorraine said it comes in many types all with an amazing sweet punch and flavor great blitzed in pestos sprinkled whole over mozzarella and showing its versatility it even makes a wonderful ice cream parsley beautifully earthy and intensely fresh use both the leaves and the stem for great depth of flavor in savoury dressing soups and salads coriander for an amazing hint of citrus often used in thai dishes coriander is perfect in curries and chutneys but it bruises easily so treat it with care tarragon a staple of french cooking this has long soft green leaves and a distinct anti-seed flavour great with chicken or in rich creamy sauces [Music] finally chervil both mild and sweet a perfect pairing with fish an incredible mix simply with melted butter for a quick source those are my favorite soft herbs what about the hard ones the harder ones tend to be a more woody plant things like thyme rosemary you've got your common time which is your ordinary general bog standard cooking time and then you've got things like lemon thyme we do an orange thyme which is actually one of my favorites it smells like thyme but it's got a deep sort of musky scent as well which is going to give you a slightly different flavor in your dish hard herbs like thyme can take more intense cooking than soft herbs so they're great in stews roast or pan frying choose the right one and you can add wonderful depth of flavor to your dishes here are my top five i use day in and day out rosemary amazingly robust with great bittersweet green leaves it's a classic paired with lamb delicious sprinkled over speciality breads like focaccia or great as toppings for fruity sorbets lorraine's favorite thyme a heady aromatic pungent herb which adds delicious flavor to a sunday roast it's amazing with wild mushrooms and is perfect in marinades oregano warm and full of delicious aromatic oils a staple of great italian dishes and perfect sprinkled on pizzas or in pasta sauces [Music] sage a strong tasting herb with a deliciously bitter flavor incredible in stuffings and with rich meats like pork or duck finally bay bitter sweet and spicy it's delicious simmered in soups stocks and risottos and just as good dried or fresh grown herbs is a lot easier than people think it is on winter boxes in balconies and it's great you can just open your window put your hand out and snip some off when you're out looking for hers make sure they're not nice and healthy no blemishes stems look strong they should just spring back it's a nice springy sort of herbs smell obviously is quite important not all things smell but obviously if you think it's one that's going to smell like lemon thyme you should have a nice fresh lemon scent and obviously the final one is taste you can tip a bit off and taste your herbs and you can see what they taste like them whether bored from a supermarket or pig from your window box herb's a great way to add fresh flavors to your dishes perfect for delicious simple suppers [Music] even if you got a super busy lifestyle it doesn't mean missing out on delicious desserts they just have to be simple to make when it comes to cooking at home puddings should always be a pleasure and never a chore and homemade puds are 100 guaranteed to impress my next recipe has only two main ingredients but simplicity doesn't mean food can't taste out of this world incredible griddle pineapple with spiced caramel if you're making a dessert for one or two it's gonna be quick and easy this sumptuous delicious griddle pineapple fits the bill perfectly pineapple a way of testing it's nice and ripe top of the leaves come out perfect ready to go always cut a pineapple with a serrated edge knife slice off the bottom turn it back over and slice the top part now keep that for later look at the core the center of the pineapple and slice down directly in half slice that in half take each quarter and slice them smells incredible lay down flat and just slice that core off so you've got this perfect sort of boat of pineapple slice underneath but stop as you get right at the end slicing around the skin will make the pineapple easier to eat but leaving it attached gives you more control as it cooks next heat a griddle pan as hot as you can start off in the corner and push it down so you really mark the pineapple two minutes on each side and then just turn them really nice color man look at that beautiful i'm gonna sprinkle them with a little touch of sugar that's gonna glaze them now slice the top take out these beautiful glazed slices of pineapple there next up the spiced caramel now start off with your pan nice and hot sprinkle four tablespoons of sugar in there just flatten it then add the seeds from a fresh vanilla pod in a small dusting of chinese fly spice never stir caramel let it sort of bubble and transform here she goes now i've got the color i want it that's the perfect color off with the gas in with the butter and then a couple of tablespoons of cream lovely and then give that a little whisk add the rest of your cream nice and just drip that spicy caramel over your pineapple [Music] wow simple elegant and seriously impressive griddle pineapple with spiced caramel a delicious treat all to yourself that tastes even better shared [Music] next my tricks of the trade and kitchen tips first up the proper way to chop fresh herbs to get maximum flavor chopping herbs the secret is to chop them not bruise them now basil this is a soft herb so treat it with some respect when people go mad chopping herbs all the goodness comes out on the board i want the goodness left inside the basil place them all inside one another with the largest leaf at the bottom and it's almost like rolling a cigar large one at the bottom small ones in the center and then look place them down together just roll them nice and gently don't bruise them step one rolled ready to slice sharp knife imperative fingers tucked in the bottom part of your knuckle is the guide between you and the herbs that there stops you from cutting your finger really important to get comfortable with a knife and just practice rolling the knife across the board and relaxing that wrist it's all in the wrist action so herbs up fingernails tucked underneath and just up and down up and down and there you have a chopped basil that's not bruised and smelling very fragra right coriander so you get the bunch of coriander hold it down and just lightly shave the leaves off the stalks bunch them up together and then just again let the knife do the work take the fingernails in and just chop once and once early don't hack it just chop it you can always identify when you've bruised the herb when you've removed the herbs off the board there's a big green patch mmm full of flavour and none of the goodness is left on the chopping board a great tip for using leftover herbs simply chop finely mix into butter roll up in clim film and freeze then when you want a herby hit cut into slices and melt over steaks chicken or veg asparagus is great for a simple supper to prepare always remove the lower woody stem by gently bending and the asparagus will snap at the perfect point then boil or steam and serve with a little of my herb butter for a cracking soft boiled egg simply place your egg in boiling water add a splash of vinegar and cook for exactly eight minutes then plunge into ice water the vinegar helps the shell peel off easily and the ice water stops the egg from cooking giving you the perfect runny yolk [Music] for fuss-free salad dressings simply add the ingredients into a jam jar screw the lid on tightly and shake to combine in seconds there's no need to wash up a whisk and the jar is ready made to store any leftovers follow my ultimate cookery course bursting with valuable lessons top tips and 100 recipes to stake your life on and you'll literally be cooking yourself into a better chef many of

Pre-order your copy of Ramsay in 10 here - https://linktr.ee/RamsayIn10...",2022-12-01 22:16:02.926159, [Music] i've got one more stop to make before i put my neck on the line to deliver an authentic vietnamese menu for my culinary mentor v i'm feeling nervous but exciting and a week is a very short time to get up to speed with something so magical but where i connect is with the ingredients because they're the hero understanding them properly will be a huge advantage going into a challenge [Music] i'm heading off the beaten track into the mountains near maichao 130 kilometers from hanoi [Music] this is rice paddy country and i'm here to get my hands on vietnam's most important ingredient and to learn the rolls royce of rice dishes to impressively these people one thing you've got to do first off is cook their rice perfectly [Music] today the village are celebrating the end of the rice harvest with a feast hello how are you good good to see you sau is the only person in the village who speaks a bit of english that was amazing honestly i felt like steam mcqueen now i know i'm a little bit late okay and the harvest is finished yes i'm sorry come in time for the feast right yes look at those little beauties there yes hello hello hello this northern hill tribe not only pick the rice they process it too but there are no mod cons here what's going on there that is fascinating they cut the rice from the beer they're taking all the little rice grains off the plant and then it's all swept into the middle of the concrete yeah you know the trash this is incredible yeah not only that i've never been on a bike this long in my life you can go towards france yeah i'm sweating like a vietnamese pig it's what all the ladies do in the morning the harvest yes sometimes the men sometimes the men if i'm going to look at risotto's in a completely different way now what's the old boy laughing at hey big boy your turn next in this 40 degrees heat i think i'd better stop before i keel over time to put all this rice to good use and learn what they do with it and what is this i'm making it's made by rice so this is the rice and it's made with the water and so it's pounded rice yes mixed with water yes that's not sticky right no yeah not sticky what is amazing for me is the fact that we cook rice one or two different ways in england you guys have put a completely different meaning on rice yes and she puts onions and pork in the middle pork and the mutton pork and mushroom incredible thank you for me to make these paper thin rice cakes i'm going to need to apply a delicate touch that's a great start are you okay yeah i'm fine the chair's [ __ ] sorry how embarrassing hopefully i can impress him with my culinary skills i've lost half my mix okay [Music] now wait wait wait wait wait oh that is what you call sticking to [ __ ] to a blanket thank god i didn't grow up in vietnam you know i've been used as a chef here we go one more time there's a fine art to this and i just don't have it no no no come come here i'm coming come in come here [ __ ] i'm not gonna screw up anymore and you know what i'm in danger of busting this chair starting to collapse again [Music] very good i'll buy some new stalls [Music] the entire village have gathered to celebrate the end of the rice harvest that is useful that is a proper face my failed attempt at rice cakes won't be on offer so i helped to serve up instead right where do we start with this fabulous feast look at this do you take you take the rice and pass it along right and news of my botched rice paper making has obviously done the rounds uh what's your job my job what do you think i do you are a doctor a doctor i'm a cook good luck for next year's harvest cheers happy harvest [Music] i have been useless but sour's honored my trip with a gift of rice from the village thank you thank you lovely that's beautiful i will do the rice justice okay they treat it like gold they show it so much respect they have a huge uh technical ability to make rice so fantastic it's it's at a different level it's been an amazing week but tomorrow it's crunch time i'll be in hanoi to prove to restauranteur v that i've cracked vietnamese cuisine so lots of things bubbling and festering away now in my mind and all i need is to disappear somewhere quiet and just start nailing down those issues the next day i head south past ho chi minh city and into the mekon delta this fertile region is crisscrossed with hundreds of waterways [Music] it's home to a floating food market where i'm heading to learn a vietnamese classic that's essential to my culinary education [Music] inside this market is a lady who's a bit of a legend she has a reputation for her broth and if i'm going to get up to speed quickly within a week about vietnamese cooking the broth is the heartbeat the broth queen mrs zehai is a veteran she's been selling her suit for 40 years and today are rolling up my sleeves to work with her good morning is here to help too so she's a master of broth she's the master of broths so let's go check it out man the only way to do it is to get in there and do it yourself and we're all going to fit on that boat you are and i am as well it's a bit rocky jesus you're right yep seahawks boat was the equivalent of a market cafe and a soup recipe is the ultimate in fast food and now she's going to teach me how to make it so the broth where did the original recipe come from is it from her mom she's from eating she eats on the street she eats in these little stores and she trains the palette to make it the best that she can on this floating river here yeah all right what's she putting out there yeah so that is the so we've got banana blossom there bean sprout yeah and then shredded uh water spinach stems yeah and throw some vermicelli noodles behind you yeah so here we just got some uh hot water warm water just gonna be a lamp okay so she cooks it very very quickly now in vietnamese cuisine the clearer with the broth the better right i mean it looks like it doesn't have much flavor but if you sip it and it's just wow very complex sea hai's trick is to put the dish together in seconds to ensure it retains its vietnamese crunch thank you wow that is delicious and the fragrance are the herbs at the end as well yes lovely coriander the sweet basil texture balance of flavor lightness that's vietnamese cuisine in that shell there for you there's no more time for me to practice today i take mrs zehai's place serving her regulars she needs to sell 60 to break even 60 bowls yeah 80 balls to make some money okay so roughly she'll make around 10. incredible how much does that go for less than a dollar less than a dollar so we're looking at 50 pence christ should we get to work now what's amazing about vietnam is this is how she advertises her dish i really wish she sings it out so she's saying both dishes but she sings in this melodic tune it's quite beautiful [Music] that's what you have to do now durian oh [ __ ] me half past seven in the morning singing for your breakfast hotel bonfire i don't think they heard you no jesus hotel pompeo 60 portions a day a minute we're going to do 80 today let's make it some money [Music] that was really good look at them rushing not one portion soldier 80s again mrs zehai spent most of her life working this patch but i could ruin her reputation in just one morning hotel bonfire oatmeal bumper okay thank god for that customer all right okay boom girl coming down real all right finally bean sprouts no no no uh-huh she said bit more bit more noodles huh it's incredible the way they work there's ladies behind you she wants jesus unreal come on wake up she said it's fantastic she's happy she's happy this is serious grafting beyond belief i mean incredible we haven't sold 20 portions yet and not just the speed you've got to work at but i'm being self-contained all into one little spot here cooking without moving i've never known making suit to be so difficult disease broth is a triumph and i'd like to do it justice hotel [Music] there we are thank you no chilli thank you thank you what do you think wrong g no she's very quiet i think she's seeing the customer i was gonna rush out that's it yep how old are you someone's called her over back to work yeah well where am i excuse me what about my brother [Music] this is hot hard work and i only managed to sell a fraction of what xehai serves up every day please enjoy thank you telling i'm a chef in the uk and i've never sat still and had to cook in one place for so long [Laughter] she said do you think it's hard work uh this yeah this is this is beyond hard work i've been to lots of vietnamese restaurants in london

intimidating but it is actually very straightforward and very easy make sure the guts are out and the fish is clean the most important thing is always leaving the skin and the scales on that skin protects the actual flesh from becoming salty give the fish a really nice seasoning inside even though we're putting a salt crust on the outside it's still very important to season the middle fennel seeds goes brilliantly well with fish and then slice the lemon nice large thick slices the zest and the lemon bakes inside the fish fold over the fish and just squeeze the juice now for the salt about 150 mil to 200 ml of water what you're trying to do now is just bring the salt together and you want to sort of end up with a bowl of salt that looks almost like snow you'll need about two kilos of salt for this and it doesn't need to be the fancy stuff even though you're using a lot of it it won't make the fish salty instead the crust forms a kiln that retains moisture now basically a nice bed of salt underneath flatten it down lay the fish on top of the salt get your salt and just start packing you can salt crust almost any fish from sea bass to salmon or flat fish like seoul but it's not great with oily fish now it looks like a ridiculous amount of salt but it's really important to cover all the fish because you want that nice shell and the minute salt hits the oven it sort of tightens up and forms this large crust that goes in at 180 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes whilst the fish cooks is onto my beautiful braised leeks splash of olive oil leek is a very sort of firm robust vegetable so it can take a really nice sear the most exciting thing about these leagues are they go gooseweek with the sea breeze but braised leeks colored properly with a lot of flavor on there tastes absolutely delicious take a couple of cloves of garlic and just crush them in with the leeks some fresh thyme get some butter in there raising them in butter and white wine gives them the most amazing flavor braising is a chefy term for searing at a high temperature then cooking with a bit of liquid bring that up to the boil and then the rest of your butter now as the white wine reduces down the flavor of the leeks intensifying they glaze turn it down just leave that little gap there if we totally covered it then you're gonna get all that condensation from beneath the lid and it'll just make the leeks watery the leeks will take about 12 minutes to cook so now for the garnish roasted hazelnuts they'll be roasted in the oven very brittle very firm so get them inside pestle and water a bit of seasoning and just crush your nuts don't over pound them i just want this nice sort of rustic chopped toasted hazelnuts now get your knife you want that going through with ease and turn off the gas right absolutely adore them like stunning little parcels soft and slightly creamy now baste the leeks with the remaining butter spread your flat leaf parsley over generously and then just sprinkle the toasted hazelnuts the combination of that earthiness from the leeks the roasted flavour from the hazelnuts that is a stunning way of eating leeks and now for the fish and look now just gently tap the top and it starts falling away you can just see that beautiful shine carefully lift off your salt now peel that skin look how juicy and succulent that sea beam is stays incredibly moist the other great thing about cooking whole fish like this it makes it so easy to fill it take your spoon run that down through the top and the fish will just slide off there now just push back that lovely it and look that is cooked beautifully that's what keeps them coming back for more and more and more when you have friends over you want to keep lunch relaxed laid back but impressive and a salt crust bring with beautiful braised leeks is just that all over southeast asia you find people cooking and eating the huge bowls of delicious noodle soups it's a very simple dish but the variations you get are extraordinary different meats different fish and even different dumplings but what i love most about noodle soup is the fact is the complete meal carbs protein and vegetables in one big bowl of happiness for my ultimate southeast asian lunch i'm showing you one of my favorites spicy clam and noodle soup followed by sweet morish banana and coconut fritters for dessert first up my dessert banana fritters take your bananas and to get them really nice and soft just rub the banana sip together flour and baking powder sugar into the flour then add coconut for texture and a pinch of salt sounds strange in the dessert but it works brilliantly especially with the fritters it makes the batter nice and crisp start crushing and use the back of the fork and just push it against the side of the bowl and then once you've mixed that through i'm gonna make that mix now slightly fragrant with some lime zest now the lime just really elevates the sort of richness and the denseness of the banana cover with clim film so it doesn't get a skin on top sit that in the fridge for 15 minutes as the banana fritter mixture rests i'm getting on with my broth for the noodle and clam soup fish stock is the base bring that up to the boil now to take that broth to another level in with chopped shallots fresh ginger add a whole chili seeds and all i actually quite like it spicy just chop once and into the broth bring up to the ball and let it simmer galangal it's sort of almost like a softer version of ginger slightly milder you can use galangal paste but i prefer the fresh stuff the stems for the coriander we'll finish the broth with the heads and that's what endeared me to the southeast asian style of cooking across my travels there was there's no waste in lime leaves for me one of my favorites incredibly pungent strong full of flavor very acidic but gives a really nice aroma to the broth just tear them in now the lemongrass so the secret here that's where all the flavor is right at the very end so you take the back of the knife and you just bash the lemongrass it's all that flavor is gonna run out in seconds that's the base of the broth done the longer you leave it the more intense it gets whilst the broth infuses soak your rice noodles in boiling water for 10 minutes just enough time to fry your fritters the batter now is ready use a metal spoon to drop the batter to the bottom of the pan i mean they hit that oil they puff up that's why it's important to put your spoon into the oil so the mixture runs off it creates this lovely little fritter and then gently fry get a slotted spoon and nice and carefully turn them over smell of that lime is extraordinary fry for two to three minutes as they start floating it signifies the fact that they're cooked off with a gas and just let them drained are those beauties lovely sprinkling when they're hot with a sugar actually sticks to them they're done ready to go the last job before serving the clams never be scared of cooking shellfish the most important rule is if they are slightly opened a millimeter discard it make sure muscles clams are always tight cook the clams for just three to five minutes or until they're all open bring that up to the boil and this is where we finish the broth touch of fish sauce a little sprinkle of sugar drain your noodles into the bowl for added texture some delicious bean sprouts get your lime fresh squeeze and lime juice in beautiful literally as the stock comes up to the boil the clams open automatically so they cook beautifully the flavor from inside the clam has enhanced the broth smell is incredible the clams cooked finish with fresh coriander and serve there you have perfect lunch a delicious spicy clam noodle with an amazing banana fritter my spicy clam noodle soup and banana and coconut fritters made in minutes and proof you only need to travel as far as your kitchen to get the taste of southeast asia [Music] succulent zingy prawn tostadas and for dessert salty caramel popcorn so good you'll want to eat it by the handful you can't beat properly home-cooked popcorn start off with just a touch of oil in there as it lightly starts to smoke corn in so now get your lid never leave it far away from you sounds like it's raining it's not so it's popcorn canals trying to pop out boom delicious just a little shake of the pan get it going and then lift that lid at your apparel we see it's a very exciting pan in there and when all that little pita pattern stops you know your popcorn is cooked nice you could eat it fresh from the pan but i've got another plan i'm gonna make a salted caramel popcorn start off with your sugar into the hot pan never stir a caramel otherwise it crystallizes it's a salted caramel so a nice pinch of salt in there as well now once you've got it to a really nice dark caramel flavor stir in your butter very carefully caramel is very very hot half a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda kickstarts the reaction that gives the caramel a honeycomb flavor mix that in you'll see it reacting almost like a large crunchy in the bottom of your bowl now the gas is off and that caramel has a nice dark rich flavor now pour in the popcorn to coat it with that incredible caramel give that a good mix it's that easy and it's gonna taste amazing lay that nice and flat once that cools down it becomes nice and brittle we've got that nice salted caramel flavor which just takes popcorn to complete dim level whilst the popcorn cools down it's onto my prawn tostada wonderful prawns gonna marinade them first with a little bit of garlic nice and fine [Music] and don't worry if you can't slice thinly just get a little grater and grate the garlic nice and fine as well nice pinch of chili flakes over your prawn garlic in salt pepper and olive oil give that a really nice little mix whilst the prawns marinade i'm gonna knock up a salad this is a really nice sort of light fragrant salad radishes topped and tailed and then into quarters cherry tomatoes halved spring onions sliced and seasoned and then just to liven things up a little bit of chili in there and slice them on an angle now the avocado cut in half give that a little twist so you just go down and down and down carefully with your knife turn it around go down and down and down and then you take your spoon and you've got your diced avocado coming out already now baby gem lettuce half then shred freshly squeezed lime juice and a little drizzle of olive oil tostada is a classic mexican style open tortilla so that lime complements it beautifully lastly roughly chop coriander and give it a mix that is the perfect base for our tostada the salad's ready now for the prawns and don't be afraid of getting the pan nice and hot teaspoon of olive oil in anything less than that sizzle when you put that first prawn in there don't put them in keep them nice and flat make sure you've got all that marinade in there as well watch them change color rapidly i'd rather cook them quicker in a hotter pan and slower in a colder pan the difference in taste is night and day the prawns will take just two minutes to cook through lime juice just over the top nice toss them over the lime these are corn tortilla quite robust and there's a kind of base that doesn't disintegrate hot pan in it's a dry pan so that corn tortilla goes nice and crispy on the outside [Music] look crispy shell to build them generous with the salad that base will stay nice and crisp next with your prawns i like to keep the tails in to the center and lay the round part of the prawn on the outside and there we have a delicious yeah very humble prawn tostada followed by my superb salty caramel popcorn beautiful [Music] prawn tostadas and salty caramel popcorn vibrant irresistible smelling dishes you'll want to dive into you

and tasty for the family or simply want something delicious to enjoy these are three amazing pasta recipes you can learn by heart and cook in minutes beautiful [Music] now here are five more of my essential cooking tips starting with how to cook an ingredient that's perfect for a quick and easy tv dinner chicken breasts this has to be the most popular part of the chicken now it's very versatile incredibly tender very lean hardly any fat whatsoever the secret is cooking it without it becoming dry the first thing is to season it properly both sides two tablespoons of olive oil get the pan nice and hot the secret now is to get a really nice color on the skin really nice color no color no flavor skin side down tilt the pan so it cooks the back of the chicken breast where it's really nice and round and very fat let the pan do the work chicken breast normally takes between sort of 10 and 12 minutes to cook properly now we've got the color on the skin the skin's nice and crispy we're going to deglaze the pan deglaze with masala now masala has a sweet fortified italian wine you can also use white wine masala in flambe burn off the alcohol which gets rid of that really sort of harsh alcoholic flavor roll the chicken around the masala the glaze in the pan basically means washing the pan and lifting off all that flavor stuck to the bottom of the frying pan and put it into the sauce now chicken stock bring that up to the boil and let it simmer for three to four minutes [Music] it's really important to leave the chicken breast skin side up the skin's nice and crispy and it's important now the chicken cooks from underneath as it starts cooking it absorbs the stock so in the center of the chicken stays nice and moist [Music] now the stock of the masala is reduced down you can have the confidence to allow it to almost disappear and look the combination between the masala and the chicken stock is quite sweet so it finishes the chicken with this really nice delicious glaze on top and there you go a delicious succulent chicken breast with the most amazing flavoursome skin phenomenal soups make stunningly simple meals my tip for adding incredible depth of flavor is to always keep your leftover parmesan rinds store them in the freezer then add to the pan as the soup cooks and leaves to infuse then remove before serving is less waste and more taste another tip to take homemade soup to the next level whisk in cubes of cold butter just before serving to get a glossy velvety texture and a beautifully rich taste another fantastic standard for a frost-free weekend eat is the classic baked potato my tip for a great crispy skin is to use salt to your advantage simply add it to the outside before cooking and the salt will draw out the moisture in the oven as it bakes a touch of salt gives you an amazingly crisp skin on chicken and fish too as well as highlighting the flavor [Music] roasted nuts make a delicious tv snack my tip for peeling them with these is to simply toast them in the oven for about 10 minutes wrap in a tea towel and rub until the skins are removed perfect sprinkle with sea salt and so with a glass of wine this is my ultimate cookery course 100 recipes to stake your life on coming up i'll be showing you my amazing sweet corn fritters that is such a delicious recipe but first the key to whipping up my ultimate tv dinners is having

in london soho for over 35 years and eating great pasta for a lifetime we'll make the best place in the world italy takes away the past in italy and the people died you know and that's it for a good very good pasta you need two ingredients you need a good egg and very good flour and that's it this is a durum wheat flour look at that it's so soft does it cook so quick couple minutes in a boiling water this thin like this couple minutes it's good this shop is not it's not big enough to store all the type of pasta this is the famous uh spaghetto albronzo this is penne different shape is called fujili antonio's right there's a mind-blowing array of incredible pasta types that are great to keep in your store cupboard here's my quick guide to some of the different shapes and sizes and how to use them small shapes like farfallini are perfect for making simple stews and soups more substantial and add an extra texture to dishes like the classic italian pasta soup minestrone short tubes like penne are great for thick cream or tomato based sauces as the rigid edges hold more sauce for an incredibly flavored packed mouthful long and thin like the store cupboard essential spaghetti the classic shape was invented in naples but every italian region has his own spaghetti dish from bolognese to carbonara or my favorite a lavongerle which is spaghetti with delicious steamed clams flat noodles shaped strands like fettuccine are perfect with a simple drizzle of olive oil or in rich buttery dishes as a little sauce goes a long way coating the pasta evenly stopping the strands from sticking together then pass the sheets not just great for lasagnas but amazing rolled into tubes and filled to make delicious cannelloni or used in quick supper dishes like my mushroom and leek pasta finally speciality pastas like this spaghetti made with squid ink has delicately sweet taste and an amazing jet black colour great for when you want a delicious dinner that's a little bit different whatever shape you go for always look out for the pastas that have been bronze cut it means the dough was pressed through a bronze cutting dye which has a subtle rough texture which helps the sauce

of the can a simple supper in minutes that's so mouth-wateringly easy and delicious you're guaranteed to cook it again and again when it comes to simple cooking there are two basic bits of kit i'm never without that will save you time and effort in the kitchen a grater and a peeler the swivel peeler a stainless steel one absolutely incredible it's almost like a lifesaver in the kitchen because they are so quick so light swivel blade so we've got so much more flexibility actually go around the vegetable and we call it speed peeler in the professional kitchen because it does literally absolutely rapidly peels your vegetables you have minimal waste good peelers cost them a couple of quid and are great for everything from peeling veg to finely slicing cheese and making shards of chocolate a good comfortable grip and a sharp stainless steel blade ensures you'll always work fast [Music] the box grater is another great versatile kitchen tool and with its planes for coarse grating fine grating and super fine as well as blades for slicing it's perfect for everything from puring ginger and zesting lemons to shredding onions super small so they can caramelize in a flash and be sure to get a solid handle to hold it firm and it's got such volume inside it doesn't crush everything up so i always prefer to grate onto a tray or into a bowl so you don't have to move it

manta is very simple first rely on your senses make sure whatever you're buying it looks smells and really feels good and if you get the chance to taste it before you buy it then do it second is to recognize that knowledge is absolutely crucial the more you know about where your ingredients are from and how they produce the better so don't be scared ask lots of questions and learn and when you want a simple supper herbs are perfect to use in your cooking they add vibrancy an amazing depth of flavor and once you get the hang of them they are so quick and simple to use and one woman who really knows these chef's best friends is expert herb grower lorraine melton i love herbs i love the way you can cook with them i love the smell of them she's been growing an incredible array of herbs in the wet cambridgeshire countryside for over 20 years and can smell a bay from a basil at 50 paces we grow about 150 varieties of herbs it's always interesting to grow new varieties see what they taste like see what they smell like it gets a bit addictive after a while broadly speaking you get harder herbs and softer herbs softer herbs are things like parsley basil rocket coriander we grow two main types of parts so we've got flat leaf parsley and curly parsley flavour-wise i think they're very similar although a lot of people would say that the flat leaf parsley has got a stronger more aromatic flavour this is your common basil sweet genovese this is a purple variety called ruben we do greek basil thai basil holy basil when you're looking for a basil you want a bright fresh basil nice leaves no blemishes and nice strong stems it's got a lot of oils in it and it's very strong smelling it just tastes a summer basil lorraine certainly knows her stuff and she's right soft herbs are delicate so for maximum flavor always use them at the end of cooking or simply add as they are to cold dishes here are my top five soft herbs that i could never live without [Music] basil as lorraine said it comes in many types all with an amazing sweet punch and flavor great blitzed in pestos sprinkled whole over mozzarella and showing its versatility it even makes a wonderful ice cream parsley beautifully earthy and intensely fresh use both the leaves and the stem for great depth of flavor in savey dressing soups and salads coriander for an amazing hint of citrus often used in thai dishes coriander is perfect in curries and chutneys but it bruises easily so treat it with care tarragon a staple of french cooking this has long soft green leaves and a distinct anti-seed flavour great with chicken or in rich creamy sauces finally chervil both mild and sweet a perfect pairing with fish an incredible mix simply with melted butter for a quick sauce those are my favorite soft herbs what about the hard ones the harder ones tend to be a more woody plant things like thyme rosemary you've got your common time which is your ordinary general bog standard cooking time and then you've got things like lemon thyme we do an orange thyme which is actually one of my favorites it smells like thyme but it's got a deep sort of musky scent as well which is going to give you a slightly different flavor in your dish hard herbs like thyme can take more intense cooking than soft herbs so they're great in stews roast or pan frying choose the right one and you can add wonderful depth of flavor to your dishes here are my top five i use day in and day out rosemary amazingly robust with great bittersweet green leaves it's a classic pad with lamb delicious sprinkled over speciality breads like focaccia or great as toppings for fruity sorbets lorraine's favorite thyme a heady aromatic pungent herb which adds delicious flavor to a sunday roast it's amazing with wild mushrooms and is perfect in marinades oregano warm and full of delicious aromatic oils a staple of great italian dishes and perfect sprinkled on pizzas or in pasta sauces [Music] sage a strong tasting herb with a deliciously bitter flavour incredible in stuffings and with rich meats like pork or duck finally bay bitter sweet and spicy it's delicious simmered in soups stocks and risottos and just as good dried or fresh grown herbs is a lot easier than people think it is on winter boxes in balconies and it's great you can just open your window put your hand out and snip some off when you're out looking for hers make sure they're nice and healthy no blemishes stems look strong they should just spring back it's a nice springy sort of herbs smell obviously is quite important not all things smell but obviously if you think it's one that's going to smell like lemon thyme you should have a nice fresh lemon scent and obviously the final one is taste you can tip a bit off and taste your herbs and you can see what they taste like them whether bored from a supermarket or pig from your window box herb's a great way to add fresh flavors to your dishes perfect for delicious simple suppers even if you got a super busy lifestyle it doesn't mean missing out on delicious desserts they just have to be simple to make when it comes to cooking at home puddings should always be a pleasure and never a chore and homemade puds are 100 guaranteed to impress my next recipe has only two main ingredients but simplicity doesn't mean food can't taste out of this world incredible griddle pineapple with spiced caramel if you're making a dessert for one or two it's gonna be quick and easy this sumptuous delicious griddle pineapple fits the bill perfectly pineapple a way of testing it's nice and ripe top of the leaves come out perfect ready to go always cut a pineapple with a serrated edge knife slice off the bottom turn it back over and slice the top part now keep that for later look at the core the center of the pineapple and slice down directly in half slice that in half take each quarter and slice them smells incredible lay down flat and just slice that core off so you've got this perfect sort of boat of pineapple slice underneath but stop as you get right at the end slicing around the skin will make the pineapple easier to eat but leaving it attached gives you more control as it cooks next heat a griddle pan as hot as you can start off in the corner and push it down so you really mark the pineapple two minutes on each side and then just turn them really nice color there look at that beautiful i'm gonna sprinkle them with a little touch of sugar that's gonna glaze them now slice the top take out these beautiful glazed slices of pineapple next up the spiced caramel now start off with your pan nice and hot sprinkle four tablespoons of sugar in there just flatten it then add the seeds from a fresh vanilla pod in a small dusting of chinese fly spice never stir caramel let it sort of bubble and transform here she goes now i've got the colour i want it that's the perfect color off with the gas in with the butter and then a couple of tablespoons of cream lovely and then give that a little whisk add the rest of your cream nice and just drip that spicy caramel over your pineapple hmm wow simple elegant and seriously impressive griddle pineapple with spiced caramel a delicious treat all to yourself that tastes even better shared [Music] next my tricks of the trade and kitchen tips first up the proper way to chop fresh herbs to get maximum flavor chopping herbs the secret is to chop them not bruise them now basil this is a soft herb so treat it with some respect when people go mad chopping herbs all the goodness comes out on the board i want the goodness left inside the basil place them all inside one another with the largest leaf at the bottom and it's almost like rolling a cigar large one at the bottom small ones in the center and then look place them down together and just roll them nice and gently don't bruise them step one rolled ready to slice sharp knife imperative fingers tucked in the bottom part of your knuckle is the guide between you and the herbs that there stops you from cutting your finger really important to get comfortable with a knife and just practice rolling the knife across the board and relaxing that wrist it's all in the wrist action so herbs up fingernails tucked underneath and just up and down up and down and there you have a chopped basil that's not bruised and smelling very fragra right coriander so you get the bunch of coriander hold it down and just lightly shave the leaves off the stalks bunch them up together and then just again let the knife do the work take the fingernails in and just chop once and once only don't hack it just chop it you can always identify when you bruise the herb when you've removed the herbs off the board there's a big green patch mmm full of flavour and none of the goodness is left on the chopping board a great tip for using leftover herbs simply chop finely mix into butter roll up in clim film and freeze then when you want a herby hit cut into slices and melt over steaks chicken or veg asparagus is great for a simple supper to prepare always remove the lower woody stem by gently bending and the asparagus will snap at the perfect point then boil or steam and serve with a little of my herb butter for a cracking soft boiled egg simply place your egg in boiling water add a splash of vinegar and cook for exactly eight minutes then plunge into ice water the vinegar helps the shell peel off easily and the ice water stops the egg from cooking giving you the perfect runny yolk [Music] for fuss-free salad dressings simply add the ingredients into a jam jar screw the lid on tightly and shake to combine in seconds there's no need to wash up a whisk and the jar is ready made to store any leftovers follow my ultimate cookery course bursting with valuable

Pre-order your copy...",2022-12-01 22:16:02.926159, [Music] lightly fried my delicious halloumi and courgette cakes squeeze every last bit of flavor out of those vegetables but first i'm preparing a simple slow roast tomato and watercress salad these cherry tomatoes are perfect if you haven't got cherry tomatoes vitamins are good or even just big normal plump tomatoes lay the tomatoes on the tray and these go into the oven for about 90 minutes if you turn the oven down really low you can leave them in overnight to be honest the longer you leave them the better they taste once you've seasoned with salt sprinkle over with some sugar and the salt and sugar combine speeds up the drying process because you want that nice chewy texture and then you get these little time flowers and just pick off the buds garlic sliced then just spread that on now the tray looks quite full and compact but 90 minutes in the oven you'll see everything shrink down all the skins blistering and the flavor intensifies so nicely extra virgin olive oil that gives a nice earthy flavor to the tomatoes place your tomatoes into an oven preheated to 150 degrees c and cook long and slow for an hour and a half now halloumi cakes there's something quite exciting about halloumi cheese it's a very firm cheese and it fries brilliantly peel the carrots [Music] great not too finely you want that nice texture next courgette the secret is keep it all grated the same put that into a sieve [Music] a sprinkling of salt will draw out liquid from the vegetables then grate the halloumi halloumi cheese doesn't look that tasty but once you've got color on it in the pan it's really really delicious now really important to squeeze out the excess water from the veg and we'll see all that water that needs to come out of there if you didn't do this it'll make your little patties non-friable because the whole thing starts to separate and then mix in with the cheese spring onions chop up the whites and the greens now we're going to season that with some delicious fresh mint and fresh coriander whenever it's vegetarian i like to put a combination of herbs in there tarragon parsley mint and coriander basil and lemongrass all delicious on their own but in tandem their flavours play off each other next two eggs in give that a little mix add the eggs to the mixture and then finally a couple of tablespoons of breadcrumbs the breadcrumbs help dry out any excess moisture mix all the ingredients together before you start shaping these taste the mixture hmm it's really important to identify the seasoning now if you wait until you've cooked them it'll be too late to adjust the seasoning roll them to a large golf ball shape them like a little mini burger you could spice these up with some chili in there if you haven't got fresh chili chili flakes and it's something that can be done up a day in advance to get your cakes firm and ready for frying put them into the fridge uncovered for 25 minutes pan on get that nice and hot while i'm waiting for that i'll get the dressing ready slice the red chili seeds and all on an angle into shards then chop fresh ginger season with a sprinkle of sugar and salt add some rice wine vinegar add a couple of tablespoons of olive oil to finish off some chopped coriander [Music] got that sweet sour spicy flavor with my chilli dressing done i can start frying off my halloumi cakes in a hot oiled pan we've got a nice crisp edge you can already start to smell that sauteed halloumi with the courgettes and carrots smells delicious really important for a nice amount of colour on them as my cakes sizzle away i can finish off my roast tomato salad one of my favorite leaves has to be watercress just cut off stalks [Music] shallot rings watercress and shallot go brilliantly well together the shallot looks so dainty when you open up these little ringlets don't forget to turn your cakes now tomatoes whatever you don't use just jar them and put them in the fridge [Music] just drop those slow cooked warm tomatoes over the watercress the sweetness is incredible absolutely delicious a little drizzle of age of smooth vinegar gives that tartness to the watercress watercress is naturally peppery so it doesn't need any pepper just a little touch of salt and then a light sprinkling of extra virgin olive oil after five minutes on a medium heat my halloumi cakes are ready so important to have taken out that water [Music] you can see it doesn't disintegrate and then just get your dressing take a spoon of it and then tilt it to the side because i want the garnish i don't want the juice if that does not turn you on to become a vegetarian for the night i honestly don't know what will delicious [Music] my crispy golden halloumi courgette and herb cakes with a sumptuous roast tomato and watercress salad all of the flavor with none of the meat when i was growing up my mom was a very very good cook so we had some great food but it was always meat and too veg and the veg definitely played a bit part but the more attention you pay to cooking vegetables the more you realize they can easily take center stage for all the flavor with known the flesh here's my ultimate vegetarian dinner first a hearty starter a bruschetta with ricotta and succulent griddle courgettes for my main i'm serving fragrant roasted beetroot and thyme risotto [Music] but i'll be in trouble with the kids if i don't do a pud so i'm enlisting the help of my youngest tilly to rustle up an indulgent chocolate and lime mousse with crushed raspberries [Music] so if you want to wrap the chocolate start breaking up in little bits we're going to make the most amazing white chocolate mousse our first job is to bring half of our cream up to the boil so what kind of cream is that in there dad that is double cream okay so that's gonna make a really nice rich chocolate mousse what's your favorite sort of chocolate is it white milk dark um i love white and milk what's yours i absolutely love milk chocolate oh that's my guilty pleasure is it really here we go cream in so that goes in there now you can see what's happening straight away can't you it's melting really quickly melting really quickly so okay oh excuse me at least your jumper's white so you won't spot it yeah i've got a nice little snack for later in another bowl add lime zest cold cream and whisk until it forms soft peaks the lime cuts the sort of richness of the cream and that starts to make the chocolate mousse taste a little bit lighter mmm it smells really good the lime gives it a really nice zingy zenith you're absolutely right next add to the melted chocolate mixture because i'm whisking it's just getting lighter and lighter and lighter have a little taste nice yeah the lime gives it a really nice taste telly i need the rest for the mousse i need them for my tummy no come on chocolate moves into the fridge our next job is to separate out three egg whites this is why i need you at your absolute best okay because to whip those whites it's gonna be really tough so we'll take it in turns 30 seconds each okay you go first seconds gone come on tilly 15 seconds gone 20 seconds gone come on you can do it 10 seconds to go five four three two one and change exit hold the ball right no no way [Music] this puny little thing and you come with a big little machine gun that's the best way of whipping up egg whites start tipping that sugar in slowly our contentious whipped egg whites will make our mousse light and airy and when they've reached soft peaks we can gently mix in our cool white chocolate and cream mixture once the egg whites hit the cream yeah the chocolate sets the egg whites keep the cream nice and fluffy and you get this nice light mousse in the bowl now i need you to crush some raspberries please with some fresh mint you can see all the juice coming out now take your mousse wow that looks really cool now look at that down the bottom there now a crushed raspberry delicious now i'm going to set that in the fridge if you can use the kind of dough please our yummy white chocolate mousse will take at least two hours to set so we can crack on with our mediterranean-inspired vegetarian starter griddle courgette ricotta and mint bruschetta for this recipe you'll need a griddle pan an essential piece of kit for that char grill look cut thick slices of chapatta bread drizzle both sides with olive oil season with a little salt and pepper and griddle each side until toasted then slice a couple of courgettes diagonally into half a centimetre thick pieces drizzle and coat in olive oil and season with salt and pepper sear on a smoking hot griddle pan in batches until all the coughettes are bar marked on both sides next roughly chop mint leaves and combine with creamy ricotta cheese spread your toasty topata with dollops of minty ricotta and top with your seared courgette super simple and super tasty now we're gonna make a delicious beetroot risotto we need to get the shallots just slice them in half and then just chop them like that okay okay now have you ever made a risotto no i haven't actually shallots please into the pan for daddy add a sprinkle of salt and pepper along with a couple of crushed cloves of garlic once you start cooking the risotto it's really important to have your stock gently boiling away if we're adding cold stock on top of the rice all the time it just slows down the process generally you cook a nice wide flat pan if you cook in a deep pan all the rice sort of cooks at different temperatures what stock is that in there dad because that's a vegetable stock yeah because you can't have different stocks if it's more vegetarian can you have chicken stock i made that mistake one's putting beef stock in the vegetarian soup did you no i didn't matilda are you sure i'm positive i'm joking fry off the time how nice does that smell it smells delicious rice in that's a bit of a different rice this is elboria rice it's a perfect rice for risotto now it's really important to sear the rice if we just put the stock in without sweating off the rice it goes all starchy so keep on stirring for daddy it's just going to make a formula no flambe on the risotto to go with our deep red beetroot theme i'm adding red wine followed by the first ladle of stock to get things started now we're off wow it's giving it a cloudy sort of look what's happening to the stock the stock is reducing down and the rice is sucking it in that's right so the rice is actually getting nice and plump one of risotto is live when it's like this now we can't stop cooking there we have to kill it all the way okay ready for the next ladle i'm ready good girl here we go ladle in so we have to make this for literally 20 25 minutes and we're nursing it all the way beetroots peel them rub them a little bit of salt and sugar yeah and a little bit of aged balsamic barcelona in there roasted them i'm gonna grate my parmesan how's that rice doing the rice is doing good now that is exactly where we want to be now look look at that nice glossy textured rice so beetroot i want you to put two thirds of the beetroot in there for me saving one third for the top good sprinkle the parmesan in there for me please all over nice looks like it's snowing again and then we're just gonna get some nice butter in there the butter gives the risotto a really nice gloss look at that beautiful let that come down let it come down first all right get your spoon in there now for daddy beautifully there you go good wonderful shake it risotto should be like lava it just flows out and then the rest of the beetroot on top and then finish and some extra virgin olive oil on top i'll pick up the bruschetta you take that to the table okay let's go danny this is my ultimate vegetarian dinner delicious courgette ricotta and mint top bruschetta an anxious roasted beetroot and thyme risotto and for put an indulgent white chocolate and lime mousse with fresh crushed raspberries

and for me it's all about getting up late and having a wonderful lazy start to the weekend with fantastic food more exciting than breakfast and a lot more enjoyable to cook brunch is ideal for sharing first up my simple and delicious frittata eggs are great they are so versatile and once you've mastered how to cook them trust me the door then opens to a wide range of delicious options this is like a triple omelette but a lot more ingredients than a normal mesh we'll start off with some lovely smoked bacon slice the bacon bacon in those salts little touch of pepper start off on a high heat get that bacon really nice and crispy otherwise you just boil the bacon and it's got that soft unpleasant texture in the frittata turn down the gas and now start adding your veg roughly chop a red pepper and add it to the pan the peppers and the bacon take the longest so they've always got to go in first now soak them off the peppers have been cooked now from that sort of rendered fat from the bacon and then the spring onions just bunch them up slice them i want them on an angle so they come like little green diamonds spring onions in now for the eggs cracking the eggs for that size pan seven or eight eggs i want to fill it right to the very top and more importantly when i turn this out i want it like a gato nice and thick so slice through and see all those wonderful verge [Music] i'm going to season the eggs with some parmesan cheese be quite generous because it adds a really nice saltiness [Music] fresh ground pepper and then whisk whisk up those eggs nicely [Music] then add peas to the pan and to give the dish a wonderful aromatic freshness some fragrant chopped basil i want to chop that sort of roughly because i want to see those flecks of green going in i want it looking charming and how many times have you seen a dull omelet frittatas in my mind really helped encapsulate the magic of having savory eggs cooked beautifully but with texture now just before we add the eggs i've got this beautiful little goat cheese and it's strong and powerful so i want to slice it into little chunks and then just have it dotted around i want to discover these little pockets of creamy goat's cheese now slowly add the eggs [Music] fill that right up and get your spoon now just let all that egg go down to the bottom bring it back up to the boil and sort of clean around the sides and then some of this delicious salty creamy goat's cheese over the top now i want it melting like a a perfect slice on toast nice now from there turn the grill on for four to five minutes [Music] now just looking at that delicious take a little paring knife and just make sure it's released on the sides just take your panel tap that will hopefully release the frittata from the bottom of the pan now the board over the panel turn that gently and just shake say a little prayer and lift off back beautiful [Music] now from there on there it's there look now slice through you can see how soft and creamy that is in the center and that goat's cheese is just melting almost like a little sauce inside it's so exciting but more importantly so easy to do it's got texture it's got creaminess and that for me will beat any omelette for brunch serve with a stack of hot buttered toast and a steaming pot of coffee this easy frittata turned the humble egg into the perfect dish for kicking off the weekend [Music] eggs are really versatile protein packed and delicious here are three more of my favorite recipes to give your brunches a tasty twist [Music] first up north african eggs [Music] add olive oil to a hot pan and fry finely chopped onions and red and green peppers [Music] then chop garlic and chili and cook until softened chili's worked brilliantly with eggs giving the dish a lovely hot kick next add fresh chopped tomatoes then cumin seeds and fry until the seeds are fragrant and the tomatoes are lovely and soft season next make wells in your spicy sauce and crack in your

spoon over the spicy prawns crumble over creamy feta cheese and grill for a couple of minutes this is eggs to the nth degree packed with different tastes textures and flavors all working wonderfully together perfect one super versatile ingredient three mouthwateringly different recipes brunch has never been better nice next my tricks to the trade and kitchen tips first up red pepper as you've seen great for frittata and north african eggs but you need to know how to cut them properly i absolutely love these peppers now they have the most amazing sweet delicious flavor with a really nice crunchy texture and the most exciting thing about the peppers is that they're just as delicious raw or cooked to identify the perfect pepper must be smooth and firm and not a wrinkle inside now how to cut the perfect pepper stalk off pepper down and get the knife start from the top and slice all the way around basically we're going to be slicing around the seeds look no faffing around like this little perfect christmas tree of seeds and you haven't got the mess all over your board and more importantly it's twice as quick discard that now we're going to cut it into a julienne flatten the pepper skin side down onto the board because it's a lot easier to slice through the pepper and just lift the knife up and down and basically julienne is a chef's word for strips these are absolutely perfect for sauteing and that's what we're looking for there crunchy delicious and more importantly no seeds beautiful many great brunch recipes start with a delicious fresh egg my tried and tested way to tell if your egg is fresh is to simply place it into a bowl of cold water a fresh egg will sink and a stale one will float if a small piece of shell goes into the bowl when you're cracking eggs my tip for removing it is to simply use a larger piece to fish it out it works like magic for prize winning fried eggs fry them in oil adding a tablespoon of water then cover the water steams the top of the egg to perfection toasted bagels are brilliant for brunch my tip to make sure you always have them on hand is to stock up your freezer but make sure you slice them first that way you can pop them straight into your toaster [Music] this is my ultimate cookery course a hundred recipes to stake your life on i'm about to show you my recipe for delicious spicy pancakes tuck it underneath there pull it back and roll but first here's my guide to buying beautiful eggs knowledge is crucial the more you know about where your ingredients are from and how they produce the better in my home kitchen i use eggs in abundance they are so versatile and getting to grips with them will make your cooking sing girlies with a decade of experience under her belt helen from harrah's farm in hertfordshire is a real egghead and has some valuable tips to share the hens we keep are designed to lay probably 300 350 eggs a year free range means that the bird must have access to the outside at all times chickens love grass they peck it whatever's on the ground and it makes the eggs a lovely rich golden color and the flavour is tremendous to tell if an egg is really fresh crack it open put it on a dish and you will see that it sits up really quite high and the white is really nice and tight around the side of the yoke there's a vast range of eggs out there to experiment with why stick to what you know try living up your brunches with something different this is a bantum egg they are miniature chickens the yolks are quite large compared to the whites of the egg and they're absolutely delicious making scrambled eggs of them because they're much more creamier all together than say a chicken's egg this is the duck's egg these ones are sort of an off-white color but they can be sort of creamy greeny colors compared to chicken eggs the duck's yolk is richer and creamier and the white is fluffier when whisks which is why they're so incredible for bacon this is the goofs egg this is quite a large egg it's probably equivalent to three chicken eggs the geese literally lay for about 12 weeks from my few geese we've had about 120 eggs they're amazing layers but just for the very short season the amazing thing is the color of the yolks of these they are usually quite orange the geese don't actually eat anything other than grass they are just grazers and that makes a huge difference to the color of the yolk another fantastic egg is the quail egg tiny but incredibly tasty they only take a minute to soft boil and are delicious dipped in celery salt if you've got a big appetite or you're making a brunch for a big group of friends you could try the giant rare egg from south america the equivalent of 10 hen eggs they're great scrambled or as a massive omelet another interesting option is the pheasant egg small but rich in flavor they're perfect for homemade scotch eggs or hard boiled in a salad you can keep eggs in your fridge but ideally when you go to use them take them out bring them up to room temperature because you'll find that they will cook better just make sure that there's no cracks in them and then you'll be assured that they're nice healthy tasting eggs [Music] brunch should be a laid-back affair and a treat so the dishes need to be easy to cook but never boring my next recipe takes the humble pancake to a whole new level of flavor and excitement soft fiery and irresistible spicy pancakes one of the secrets to good cooking is learning to use your imagination when it comes to brunches you don't have to stick to the old standbys these delicious spicy pancakes are really great alternative but more importantly so easy to do start off by toasting your cumin [Music] it's a dry roast basically non-stick pan just a touch of seasoning the salt helps to dry out the cumin even more and then fresh ginger slice them nice and thinly stack it back up and then just slice nice little thin slices in there and then keep that bunched up shake the chilli removing the seeds will prevent things getting too hot now garlic nice now add olive oil to your toasted cumin seeds and then with the garlic ginger and chili lovely [Music] and it feels strange when you talk about garlic for breakfast but the time i spent in india everybody was eating something savory for breakfast it was extraordinary into your bowl and set aside next the pancake filling add olive oil to a hot pan mustard seeds in now they'll start dancing the minute they hit the pan then finely slice an onion onions in a little teaspoon of turmeric sprinkle that in and look at the color an instant change leftover potatoes just slice them the smell is incredible potatoes in now spread the potatoes across the pan all the potatoes stained i want them sort of absorbing all that really nice turmeric actually like a sponge season those potatoes and it really helps to bring out the spice beautifully they're ready turn off the gas and let them sit there and absorb all those flavors back to the pancake batter add plain flour to your cooled garlic chili ginger and cumin seeds a touch of salt and pepper nothing worse than the bland pancake one whole egg milk hold the jug with one hand and whisk with a secret to get that really nice smooth paste but whisk in that egg first and brings it together and then you're milking don't put all the milk in because then you're gonna get a lumpy pancake mix and if you put less milk in it really helps it not going lumpy look at that milk here the secret for me is to have a nice thin mix now just a little teaspoon of oil that helps to bring a nice crispy edge to the mixture now just taste it that's the texture pan on the larger the pan the better it helps to create a nice thin even surface i want that mix going all the way around the pan before you put the mixture into the pan make sure you give your pancake mix a really nice stir pan it's nice and hot turn down the gas a touch of olive oil in get that nice whisk with one hand pan to the mix in one and a half ladles and then roll it around which is really nice and thin i want to see the ginger the garlic that's what i'm looking for in there now back onto the heat it only starts to remove from the bottom of the pan and lifts itself up once it's cooked these little bubbles confirm that it's just starting to lift off the pan a little shake that releases it and then just shake it to the end and toss if you haven't got the confidence tossing then use a spatula and turn it over now that's exactly what i want that nice sort of crisp edge around the side the color on the pancake is so important now roll it round and just let it slide out beautifully now for the exciting part filling them take your potatoes just sort of have a really nice imaginary line and then just very carefully roll that nice and tightly tuck it underneath there pull it back and roll the delicious pancakes are ready to eat but with a simple dipping sauce they'll be a real treat just mix chopped coriander with natural yogurt that's really nice cooling agent sit there on the side and that for me is a great brunch delicious spicy pancakes amazing [Music] follow my ultimate

great way of relaxing with friends and family not taking yourself or anything else too seriously and brunch dishes should reflect that spicy sweet or savory anything goes and one of my all-time favorites a dish that always creates a stir is the daddy of all brunches steak sandwiches [Music] for me the secret of a great brunch is fun and casual fuss-free cooking and everyone helping themselves this is the ultimate steak sandwich you want the rolls royce of beef it has to be fillet now season it beautifully i like to open up the top of the peppermill to increase the size of the pepper in the steak so it gives that bit of heat nice little chunks you just roll now nicely all the way around now slice the garlic in half pan nice and hot olive oil in [Music] hold the steak and just place it into the pan don't drop it at the front of the pan we're going to tilt the pan forward to cook the back of the steak dual purpose now roll it back and sear underneath next my garlic and roast that garlic time fry that time i want to hear it we're not looking for a lot of color because you're going to dry out the fill it so just one end turn it back down and stir the other end in lift up your time place it on top of the garlic there lift up your fillet and sit there on top of your garlic butter in take a spoon tilt the pan gently lift up and baste i've got that scented garlic thyme flavor the steak is going to cook evenly because it's sat on a little a little bed in the oven for 8 to 10 minutes [Music] pan on for the relish you think of a steak sandwich you think of a sort of nice heated tomato relish to make the relish finely dice a red onion three finger rule one in front two behind through and chop wow next roughly chop a chilli keeping the seeds in for extra heat start off with the olive oil into a pan onions chili [Music] generous with the olive oil i want a nice sort of rich silky relish from there take your tomatoes you can't just use red tomatoes but these yellow and red make the perfect combination now put your salt in pepper and then roast those tomatoes off take a wooden spoon and just sort of break them up once the skins blister the whole tomato just starts to release all that really nice sweet texture a little teaspoon of cherry vinegar gives that nice acidic balance the sweetness of the tomatoes turn down the gas and just let them sort of stew perfectly now a steak sandwich would not be complete unless it had the most amazing mustard mayonnaise simply add three tablespoons of mayonnaise to three teaspoons of whole grain mustard [Music] now i've got the reddish almost down to like a really nice jam now i want to make that relish a little bit more fragrant some basil slice it through and sprinkle that basil in there [Music] beautiful look at this there she is my crown jewels time to take it out smell is incredible just baste one more time to fill it touch is quite soft in the center so it's just coming up to mid-rare let it rest the same time you cooked it it'll be nice and pink evenly throughout the steak to make my sandwich i'm going to char grill some sliced chipatta bread season it nicely just a little drizzle of olive oil i want to get that bread nice and crispy pan nice and hot bread in push it down smell is amazing that char sort of charcoal flavor once you've got those marks on the bread it just stops the bread from becoming soggy and look at this here it is stunning on slice it gently one beautiful slice wow it's nice and pink all the way through and the beef is so soft it's almost like slicing through butter let the knife do the work take a little bit of mayonnaise spread that the back of the spoon on both sides next lettuce take that beautiful slice of beef and then relish on top of that beef and just slice the sandwich in half beautiful now that's what i call a steak sandwich trust me serve the sublime sandwich for brunch and you'll put a smile on everyone's face [Music] next up my guide to buying the best beef and steaks if you want the ultimate brunch you can't do any better than start with a perfect steak and one man who really knows his steak is master butcher danny lidgate steak is my favorite type of meat and i think it's really good to enjoy different varieties of steak when choosing a steak that you want you need to look at exactly what you want out of it for my ultimate steak sandwich i used to fill it because it's the most tender the fillet does the least amount of work than all the other muscles is tucked away in the ribcage this means that when you're buying a fillet it's incredibly soft like butter it's the most expensive but you get what you pay for there's a wide array of cuts to choose from all different in taste and texture if in doubt ask your butcher this would be the rump section where the rump comes from which is basically the back side take the bone out and what you're left with is a wonderful steak rum steak characteristically a little bit tougher than the sirloin or a little bit chewier than the ribeye but a really strong flavor for the steak again when frying rum look for the marbling try and get some fat covering on the steak you can always cut it off after it's cooked rumps one of the best value steaks i love it thinly cut and flash fried in stir fries or simply marinated and whacked on the barbecue another great value but delicious cut is the hangar steak known as the butcher's cut because they often keep it for themselves it's great marinated and cooked quickly with the sirloin which is basically the back of the animal a nice sirloin like this really well marbled don't buy too lean so once the sirloin is trimmed up it looks something like this not too much fat but you need a little bit to cooking it next to the sirloin is the rib really popular now with eyes small nice really tender juicy steaks it's really especially good for barbecuing or grilling fantastic probably my favorite steak would be a rib eye rib eye is especially delicious because the marbling in the meat loads it with flavor for a full-on steak experience try the t-bone steak with a small tender fillet steak on one side of the bone and a larger flavoursome sirloin on the other [Music] take your butcher's advice and you won't go wrong the final word has to go to danny when buying me knowledge really is power so it's important to ask as many questions about the meet you're buying find out the breed how it's aged and decide exactly what you want to do each particular job that should then give you a really amazing end product [Music] the great thing about brunch is there are no rules the only thing i insist on are it's got to be fuss-free easy to cook and so delicious it puts you in a good mood for the rest of the day and for me pancakes always hit the spot here are three of my deliciously different recipes certified to liven up your mornings first up fluffy blueberry and ricotta pancakes with yogurt [Music] start by adding 125 grams of plain flour a teaspoon of baking powder a pinch of salt a tablespoon of sugar then create a wet in the center separate two eggs and add the yolks keeping the whites for later beat the yolks into the flour pouring in milk gradually to form a smooth batter [Music] next fold in 125 grams of creamy ricotta cheese and 100 grams of fresh blueberries [Music] now whisk your egg whites until they almost reach soft peaks then gently fold into the pancake mix keep it in the air to make sure the pancakes are extra light and really fluffy add olive oil and butter into a hot pan then

fresh mango and drizzle over the gorgeous citrusy syrup sweet sticky and utterly irresistible ready in under 20 minutes the ultimate indulgent pancakes [Music] fast to prepare easy to make three effortless recipes guaranteed to bring some sparkle to your brunches incredible welcome back to my ultimate cookery course i'm teaching you all about brunches the most laid-back meal of the week and if you want to take it easy having the right equipment makes all the difference [Music] here's my guide to the best kitchen equipment everything you need to know about the basic kit that will get you cooking fantastic food chopping boards for brunch one of the most useful things is a great chopping board get the right one and it'll be your friend for life i prefer a sort of heavy duty one because they're so much more durable they can be flipped over the minute you want to go from vegetables to prepping fish or meat always keep a little jake off underneath that actually stops the board from sliding carefully wooden board by rubbing it with oil every so often any cooking oil will do wooden boards for me are always the best easy to clean and long lasting when you do wash your wooden board never let it stand in water or put it in the dishwasher as it may split buy the best you can afford and take good care of it [Music] for brunch i'd love something sweet and i've always been a fan of classic british crumpets with butter and jam but once you try cooking them at home you'll never want to buy them from shops again this is another great recipe you can stake your life on it's my homemade crumpet whether you're cooking for two three or even a gang some of the best brunch dishes are always the simplest these crumpets are absolutely delicious and it's a great end to a fantastic brunch first off we're gonna make the mix what do you think of growing up the smell and the taste of amazing crumpet and never leaves you to make the mix the secret is to bring the milk up the ball but do not boil it the minute it boils turn it off and let it sit there now flour in a nice pinch of salt in now add half a teaspoon of bicarb that gives it aeration and really lifts the mixture up all those lovely little holes a nice pinch of sugar and then a teaspoon of yeast dry yeast now once the milk's boiled turn it off and add some warm water about 10 tablespoons 150 mil that cools down the milk but more importantly it doesn't destroy the yeast half of the milk in first stop and give that a really good mix now the rest of it [Music] [Music] you can just see that there's no lumps through there as it drips through the whisk now we're looking for it to double in size and get nice and light so pop in a warm place whilst you get on with the delicious topping [Music] beautiful strawberries but caramelized almost like a very quick strawberry jam hang on [Music] just slice these in half some sugar a couple of tablespoons we're gonna take the sugar to a nice light caramel it's just starting to change color now turn the gas down and we're gonna add the strawberries beautiful just sweating the strawberries down quickly and the caramel's breaking down a wonderful glaze on the strawberries some lemon grated into the strawberries gives it that kind of freshness that really starts to break down the strawberries nice gas up smells incredible some lemon juice a touch of balsamo vinegar and that gives it that really nice delicious tartness now off it goes as the strawberries start to cool down it will naturally thicken and set beautifully nice [Music] now for the crumpet it's almost doubled in size but be very careful you don't knock the bowl because it can sort of push out all that air it's aerated it's nice it's light just see the texture she's ready to go did you boil it here we go instead of making normal small crumpets i'm making a giant one ideal for sharing now turn the gas down you can just start to see a traditional crumpet-style cooking process we want those nice tiny little holes on top and that crispy crunchy base right now it's time to add the butter just slide the butter down the back that gives it a really nice nutty flavor at the end fish nice flip beautiful take that out take the jam spoon over the secret is for the juice to sort of run inside all those little holes think of that tartness of the balsamic vinegar the strawberries beautifully soft and almost pureed wrapped in that delicious caramel now finish that with a nice ball of creme fraiche let that sit there and that is an amazing way of finishing off a traditional brunch with something sweet something delicious and something you're dying to tuck into [Music] next my tricks of the trade and kitchen tips fruit can be a great healthy option for brunch and knowing how to get the best out of it can make all the difference first up how to peel and cut a mango the easy way holding your stalk end up cut either side of the stone cut all the way into the flesh making squares without cutting through the skin then turn it inside out and carefully cut your pieces off a great tip to check if a pineapple is ripe is to pull a leaf out from the top if it comes away easily it's ripe and ready for slicing my tip to get the flesh out of a kiwi is to simply cut the fruit in half and scoop it out with a teaspoon try it it really works if you have fruit that's not perfectly ripe the tip is to put a banana in a paper bag then add your unripe fruit put it in a dark place and the banana will speed up the ripening process of the other fruit you can make a great fruit puree to accompany a brunch pancake or a crumpet in a blender to clean it afterwards add a cup of warm water and run the machine for a few seconds empty out then simply repeat with a drop of washing up liquid then rinse [Music] follow my ultimate cookery course bursting with valuable lessons top tips and 100 recipes just take your life on and you'll literally be cooking yourself into a better chef many of

hide in the lake's muddy bottom [Music] local domestic goddess and food writer duressie john is going to show me how to do justice to these slippery blighters wow okay excellent how are you i'm very now the secret behind what we're going to do take the scales off first yeah yeah scale is not the way you do it with your sea bass we're going to slice it off ready this is how you take it up see it's coming it's exactly the same way as the japanese do oh really yeah exactly the same way normally we just scrape the skin yeah yeah i know but you can't do this because the taste of the scales will remain on that it's not good thing you need a little more patience i think garden no no you don't you see you you have not sliced it see they're so fiddly yes you're doing it yeah excellent so your

we are going to make the parcels right of the fish that stop the fish and chicken yes i think we just need to put some here this is the delightful twist on the french technique on puppy yacht but instead of steaming the fish inside a paper bag we're using a banana leaf and now i'm going to fold it so you wrap it quite tight yeah we wrap it rather tight and how long will they take to cook about 15 to 20 minutes maximum this banana parcel keeps all the moisture and flavor locked in so you're searing it in yeah [Music] that looks fantastic let's just slide the fish over the bow look at that wow how does it taste that's delicious creamy delicious and i thought it was going to taste slightly of mud or silk but no it's fresh it's vibrant and it's very dense based them into a dover sole but

these tacos mix a mexican and japanese flavors into a delicious meaty mouthful first off get that pan really nice and hot these are sirloin steaks sear it in the pan with all that fat on they'll add flavour salt and pepper couple tablespoons of olive oil in pan nice and hot hold up the steak and lay it in always lay away give the panna a little shake and it stops the steak from sticking we're looking for color and if it sticks it's gonna burn [Music] while the steaks are cooking i can get on with my super quick marinade now two tablespoons of misood paste that's a fermented soy bean that gives a really nice sort of rich sweetness tablespoon of sugar a couple of tablespoons rice wine that gives it a really nice vinegary kick a couple of tablespoons of olive oil salt and pepper i'm looking for a nice sort of thick rich marinade marinade done it's time to turn the steaks sort the pan and to give the steaks a little base all we're doing every time is just adding more more flavor take your tongs and sort of lift the steak on its back and really melt all that fat down offer the gas take them out just take your knife see all that fat there just slice that off i don't want any of that now in to the marinade [Music] beautiful tacos are one of mexico's most popular street foods they've been made from beef pork chicken or fish and are loaded up with amazing sauces and spices now i want something sort of pickly cabbage these are um chinese cabbages slice it in half look at it really crisp and really tasty we're gonna slice that into quarters and then just shred it and take your time you think of cabbage here and you think you're sort of braised overcooked cabbage nothing worse but at a taco you want freshness a little season of chili flakes they sort of discreetly give it a little bit of heat a little touch of rice wine vinegar if you haven't got that fresh lemon juice a small drop of toasted sesame seed oil give that a really good mix now i need something to sort of bring it together we take some wasabi paste very hot very spicy a sort of thumbnail size i'm gonna mix that with a couple of tablespoons of mayonnaise and give that a really good mix these are basic corn tortilla the trick is to sort of color them and then shape them actually place it on the gas ring use some tongs so it's not to burn yourself you can also toast your tacos in a frying pan from there i'm just going to place it on the rolling pin literally 30 seconds as it cools down the great thing about serving tacos is people can fill them themselves just the way they want them cabbage just squeeze out wet marinade nice rustic little mountain mayonnaise on wait you see how soft and delicious and almost sort of melting in the mouth texture we've got on this amazing sirloin it's got that really nice sear around the outside it's just nice and pink in the middle start off with my crispy shell back of the spoon with the wasabi mayonnaise inside taco and just sprinkle that delicious pickled cabbage and then just start lining my taco three or four slices touch more on my spicy mayo and that is how i'd make the perfect taco [Music] malt chocolate donuts street food is all about satisfying your cravings these donuts are sweet sticky and absolutely delicious first off we're gonna make the dough now this dough takes a bit of time but it's really exciting i'm heating all of the milk with the sugar this yeast easy to get hold of now when you make fresh donuts you need fresh yeast adding some of the warm milk to the yeast will activate it which will help the dough to rise just half give that a quick whisk the sugar is dissolved in the milk the fresh yeast disintegrates instantly set the yeast mixture to one side while it does its job to start the main dough mix i'm adding half the butter to the remaining milk that gives the dough a nice silkiness i want it light so melt the butter into the milk flour into a sieve that helps to make the dough nice and smooth and you know what when you've got a smooth dough it sort of rises evenly add a pinch of salt and two egg yolks pour in the warm milk and melted butter don't start over mixing it when you over mix the dough of the doughnut it gets really tight you're not gonna let it ariel yeast in nice and warm i love that smell now i'm looking for a sort of elasticy texture just dropping off the spoon nice flour the board take the dough out lovely lightly sprinkle touch more flour and just pull it over and push in every time you're sort of turning it almost like you're turning the dough into itself the dough should just sort of relax it shouldn't be sticking to your fingers now it's just nice and pliable set that in a nice clean bowl a little sprinkling a flour in there so as it starts to rise it doesn't stick cover that with some film leave the dough to rise in a warm place for 60 to 90 minutes until it's doubled in size this stage is called proving now whilst that's proving get a panel for the chocolate filling or ganache pour 500 ml of double cream into a saucepan and add honey [Music] bring the mixture to a gentle boil [Music] traditionally we've always put jam in there but chocolate and donuts wow to die for add the cream i'll give that a good mix the butter elevates the ganache into a really nice shiny chocolate coat look at that whoa give it a really nice whisk the whistling gives it that aerated texture to the ganache you're just lightening the load a little bit nice chocolate filling done put it in the fridge to cool then it's time to gently roll out the dough just let it roll naturally a centimeter and a half in depth slice one two place them on to your tray and let them rise again once the donors have had 30 to 40 minutes to rise it's time to shallow fry them in a pan filled one third full with hot vegetable oil risen but look they're sort of like little pockets of air right here we go place these in nice and carefully four maximum if there's too many in the pan the oil will go cold and the donuts will come out soggy turn them over beautiful [Music] they're going to come out into some sugar mixed with some malt powder 50 50. how do you tell they're actually cooked in the center tap on top it should be hollow in and just sprinkle the malt and the sugar shake off the excess i get so excited every time i make donuts now look at those beauties these are delicious eating as they are but the ganache is gonna be the icing on the cake piping bag peel the bag over your hand don't forget to pop the nozzle in i want the texture almost like a little liquid inside so i'm going to pipe them in a little bit warm hopefully you've got that burst of magic operation donut lift up the donut squeeze push in and fill just to start seeing that chocolate coming out and sit that back down nice sit them on there they've got a little bit heavier and we all know why nice that one's got my name on it that is amazing [Music] slow cooking is one of the best weapons in the chef's arsenal not only is it easy it's also an incredible way to transform meat into mouth-wateringly melting dishes mastering the art of slow cooking is something every cook should learn first up my phenomenal slow cooked beef short ribs slow cooking is a brilliant way of getting lots of extra depth and intensity into your dishes the secret is to lock in all those flavors at the start and let the ingredients do their thing as it cooks these are beef short ribs and there's basically five to six bones across there and as the short rib cooks it sticks to that bone the bone implants flavor and the meat just sort of melts cooks slowly gives it that nice level intensity slice alongside the bone straight down you can see that marbling that sort of disappears and disintegrates i'm cooking them in a roasting tray get it on the heat until nice and hot season these short ribs beautifully olive oil in bone on the top we'll start coloring that in really important to give the beef short rib a really nice sear if you didn't brown the meat off it goes in the oven and it looks like boiled meat so you really want that nice dark rich coloring just cut the garlic in half slide that down the side that's going to give that beef an amazing flavor [Music] to give body to the sauce stir in a heaped teaspoon of tomato puree i'm just hitting the bottom of the pan with that tomato puree and we call it cooking out that smell of puree otherwise it just goes in there raw and it gives this sort of tartness to the braised short ribs red wine in don't use an expensive bottle of red wine there's no need bring the wine up to the boil and reduce it this burns off the alcohol and concentrates the flavor it makes a big difference when you reduce the red wine down by half because it gives that nice dark rich intensity look at my garlic that is just gonna sweeten everything up incredible stock in beef stock perfect chicken stock fine just to about an inch underneath the beef short ribs bring it up to the ball to lock in all that flavor as the beef ribs slow cook cover them so they braise from the bottom and steam from the top into the oven two and a half hours 170 to 180 degrees she goes the great thing about slow cooking is you do most of the work in advance and then put your feet up five or ten minutes before the beef short ribs come out of the oven start your garnish this is light cured pancetta i want nice thick lardons nice big thick sticks of crispy bacon [Music] these are delicious chestnut mushrooms i'm not gonna slice them i'm just going to cut them in half but look at the color on those lardons now all the whites raw fat have disappeared the lardons have shrunk right down and all we've got there now is the proper bacon mushrooms in beautiful so the mushrooms get seasoned from the bacon i'm pan frying these separately to the beef so they remain crisp and have a different texture [Music] leave that to cool down now this is like christmas day for me when you unwrap that fall wait you see what's underneath it [Music] wow they smell incredible lift and place on the tray beautiful to make a fantastic rich deep sauce

cuts because the results are incredible amazing beef braised short ribs with bacon and mushrooms mushrooms are one of my all-time favorite ingredients i use chestnut mushrooms with the beef short ribs because i love their firm texture and nutty taste but there's a huge range of other mushrooms that are great for slow cooked dishes [Music] and when it comes to buying them there's one expert green grocer who's a fountain of knowledge borough marcus fred foster started off on the dead storm in pimlico really he had a salad stall with over 20 years of experience he could actually write his own mushroom encyclopedia mushrooms as soon as you pick them the moisture starts coming out of them so you need to buy them when they're fresh certain products you smell for flavor and they tend to be fruits mushrooms don't smell nice at all they smell kind of metallic really so you have to use your eyes as your guide of what you buy with mushrooms really really important wild mushrooms are literally grown wild in the forest they're just quality wherever they are this is morel mushroom a fantastic product so hard to find in the world it's almost got an apricoty type of flavour earthy woody and of course as you cook it the flavour increases for extra flavor and texture highly prized morels are ideal when added to slow cooked stews and casseroles as are the trumpet de la more which have a deliciously rich flavor another wild type to try is the chanterelle its subtle fruity flavor is delicious and perfect fried with butter parsley and garlic when you're dealing with wild mushrooms you need to clean them it can be quite a slow process it's with a soft brush don't don't use water never use water with mushrooms it deteriorates the mushroom rapidly oyster mushrooms are very meaty mushroom just a lovely silky smooth flavor really nice how do you tell uh whether it's fresh those gills are bright never cut an oyster mushroom always tear it look at the whiteness of that beautiful that would be grey if it was old although also found wild oyster mushrooms are more commonly cultivated along with a similar type the enoki their delicate taste is great in salads and soups finally fred saved the best until last of course the pinnacle is the truffle they are really really sought after the smell is so intense that smell it's hard to describe because it's such a unique smell the more expensive the truffle the more intense the smell so that's why you use such a small amount on a dish it's amazing the way they get these they used to use pigs of course but they don't do that anymore they use dog steel but because the pigs used to eat them all this magical tasting fungi is by weight one of the most expensive foods in the world it's phenomenal eaten raw shaved over pastel or risottos or drizzle of truffle or turn slow cooked stews into something out of this world people are actually scared of mushrooms aren't they so it's amazing really they shouldn't be because take away the fear and just close your eyes and taste them they're just amazing they are amazing [Music] all the ingredients in one dish helps lock in taste and get great flavors working together here are three recipes that turn civil ingredients into amazing dishes first up a fantastically aromatic melt-in-the-mouth treat pork neck curry with mango salsa [Music] for the curry paste add chopped lemongrass chili fresh ginger garlic and kaffir lime leaf to a pestle and water next put in aromatic ground cinnamon and coriander a pinch of salt black pepper [Music] then bash it into a rough paste finally add olive oil to loosen and your paste is done now onto the pork neck add a lug of olive oil to a hot pan and brown the diced meat carefully making sure each side hits the heat locking in that flavor remove and in the same pan cook sliced onions until brown around the edges add the curry paste and fry to release all the intense flavors then put the pork back in along with the coconut milk and stir next add chicken stock palm sugar more kaffir lime leaves soy sauce and fish sauce to taste then simply simmer for an hour [Music] slow cooked for succulents spicy super easy to make and wonderful served with fresh mango salsa pork make curry my next easy slow cooked recipe is incredible spicy szechuan chicken thighs [Music] first marinade the thighs with soy sauce and shaoxing wine which is made from fermented rice and tastes similar to dry sherry chicken thighs do a lot of work so they need more cooking but cooked properly they're moist and they're the tastiest part of the bird next add rice vinegar water then season and leave to marinade for up to two hours then chop garlic chili and ginger add olive oil to a hot pan and fry until softened add szechuan peppercorns and orange zest next add the marinated chicken thighs along with a marinade then throw in a pinch of sugar and fry the chicken until it's lovely and brown and the sauce is deliciously thick [Music] finish with chopped spring onions add like a soy sauce and a few drops of sesame seed oil marinated for flavor sweet and spicy chicken a fuss-free wonder [Music] my final slow cooked dish that transforms simple ingredients into unforgettable food is simple beef brisket [Music] start by seasoning the meat well brisket is a cut of beef from the breast it's inexpensive but it's fit for royalty with long slow cooking place into hot casserole dish with a little olive oil and brown on all sides [Music] next make a tasty broth to flavor the meat into the dish add chopped carrots celery a whole bulb of garlic cut in half peppercorns aromatic cloves and freshly ground nutmeg [Music] pour in hot water to braise the brisket bring to the boil and cover tightly then transfer the dish to a low oven and cook for three to four hours cooked low and slow the results are amazing tend to melt in the mouth meat fantastic with roast potatoes or in sandwiches with lots of mustard but i like it best with tangy picky lily in the oven in under 10 minutes then all you have to do is sit back and wait so easy and absolutely delicious what's not to love about my succulent beef brisket this is my ultimate cookery course 100 recipes to stake your life on soon i'll be teaching you a wonderful slow cooked dessert now look at the color on them the smell is incredible but first five more of my 100 tips to make your home cooking easier [Applause] starting with how to cook duck breast perfectly the slow way duck breasts never be scared about cooking this bird absolutely delicious very healthy first oven on 200 degrees and then salt pepper now the salt will help to extract the water out of the fat non-stick pan no oil but start the duck breasts in the pan cold skin side down it feels and sounds a little bit weird but if you put them into a cold pan and turn the heat up gradually it starts to release the fat if we put them into a hot pan it seals them in and the fat stays in there we want to render that fat down 90 percent of that duck breast will be cooked on its skin keeps the duck nice and moist but more importantly it stays crispy once the fat comes out turn the duck over nice high hot heat seal the duck now they're going in the oven skin side down 200 six to eight minutes if your pan's got a plastic handle then transfer the duck breast onto a tray but make sure you put the tray into the oven to get hot first cooking duck is like cooking a piece of beef and you can't slice it piping hot all the goodness runs out just quickly turn it over push your fingers in there and it's slightly resistant but still quite bouncy and that confirms they're quite pink in the center but the important part now is leaving that to rest let them cool down and then we'll slice them keep that excess duck fat and there you go next time you're sauteing potatoes you just take them to a completely different level now slicing the dirt just slice at an angle not too thin if you slice it thinly it goes cold quickly so nice thick slices nice crispy skin on top and a beautiful clump roasted duck all the white fat gone nice crispy skin and absolutely delicious [Music] another slow cooking tip is when slow cooking stews and casseroles fat will rise to the surface to get rid of any excess oils my tip is to remove them with kitchen paper before serving [Music] this also works brilliantly on gravies and sauces many great slow-cooked dishes start by browning the meat as the meat cooks lots of flavors get stuck to the pan to get it into your sauce delays with wine stock or vinegar never add soft herbs at the beginning of slow cooking they're all too delicate the tip is to add them at the end for that hit of fresh flavor and vibrant color a great tip when frying fish is to always fry skin side down to keep it crispy and always lay the fitters away from you when adding to the pan to prevent hot oil from splashing towards you [Music] slow cooking isn't exclusive to just savory dishes it's a clever way to transform fruit into wonderful desserts giving them an amazing sticky jammy intensity invest a bit of patience and my next recipe pays off big time and bursting with flavor caramelise figs with ricotta slow cooking can also take desserts to a whole new level a gentle long cook can really bring out that wonderful rich sticky sweetness and that depth of flavor in fruits these are black figs they are suited to slow cooking roasting better than the green fix because this outside skin is so durable this is an amazing way of roasting figs and it's so easy yet so delicious lay your figs out in rows take some rosemary and just peel that down get that really nice fragrant stem get your scissors trim the edge almost we've got a bit of a sort of sharp point bring your three figs together and just thread the top of each fig nice and gently rosemary works wonderfully with sweet dishes as the figs roast in the oven the stalk will impart a lovely subtle flavor useful dust the figs with icing sugar then coat them with a generous splash of balsamic vinegar leave them to sit there for five minutes and they sort of marinade i know it sounds odd to use vinegar in your dessert but trust me it gives the dish a fantastic sweet and sour taste i'm gonna make a really nice caramel four or five tablespoons of sugar now flatten that out and get it nice and even when the sugar is even caramel cooks evenly it's changing now you can see it melting from the outside in the one thing you don't do is shake the pan rapidly and see it almost like sort of a lake defrosting and it's hitting to the center bubbling still not dark enough yet it's getting there turn the gas down and stay in control let the sugar melt until it turns a dark amber color the secret behind any good caramel is just stopping it from overcooking lovely take that off the gas knob of butter in there just gently whisk in the butter it's cooling the caramel down you'll see it changing color to like a cafe lay next add a log of the balsamic vinegar nice beautiful got that nice dark richness of the caramel a little touch of water in there that way the caramel doesn't go too thick now put the caramel back on the heat take your figs and sort of place them in gently lovely and then just add all that lovely little marinade mmm don't waste that it's amazing stuff there [Music] nice icing sugar and balsamic vinegar there's something so tasty baste those figs because the skin gets nice and crispy on the outside and the fig sort of just absorbs the caramel delicious so easy now into the oven 190 for 10 minutes [Music] almost doubled in size now look at the color on them the smell is incredible onto your plate they're a lot heavier because they've actually started absorbing that caramel now douse the figs with caramel and serve with ricotta cheese the freshness of that ricotta goes brilliantly well with the figs i'm gonna finish that now with some zest and then some little nibbed almonds and the rich creamy jam texture of the fig with the ricotta is brilliant that is an amazing way of slow roasting fruit and taking figs to a completely new level [Music] follow my ultimate cookery course crammed with key lessons top tips and 100 recipes to stake your life on and you'll literally be cooking yourself into a better chef many of these amazing recipes are on my app

little preparation required and it's the oven that does all the work my first recipe is packed with strong confident flavors and with the oven taking the strain is a pleasure to make [Music] delicious slow braised stuffed lamb breast one of the secrets to slow cooking is to be robust and really get stuck in big bold flavors work really well so don't be precious this is gutsy cooking at its absolute best these are lamb breasts a beautiful cheap cut and it's sort of tucked alongside the rib they've been boned out the skin has been taken off i'm going to roll them stuff them and braise them braising simply means cooking in liquid on a low heat making the meat divinely tender now open them up and give them a really good season season on both sides inside and out really important it doesn't look like a real weighty dense cut of meat but once it's beautifully slow braised it's just like melting lamb it's incredible i'm going to season the breasts with some dried oregano put a heat in there some chili flakes [Music] lemon zest put some amazing salty anchovies in there now they almost melt inside the lamb so the balance of flavors work beautifully now pull it down towards you and roll that nice and tightly that's what i'm looking for string i just need to tie them three times one at each end and one in the middle i fell in love with this dish years ago when i first started working in paris because we had all the lamb in from the pyrenees the nice thing is they can be done the day before pan on olive oil in get that oil nice and hot lamin really important to get some nice color on there whilst they're browning slice the onion the lamb's gonna be cooking for two and a half hours so don't slice the onions too thinly otherwise they'll burn garlic and leave whole got a color on them look at that beautiful take them out onions in and garlic straight in lovely that's the secret about slow braising you never change pans why all the goodness is in that one pan a few chili seeds in there oregano nice pinch a little bit of lemon in there i'm gonna do the onions what i did to the lamb [Music] next my capers fry them off get them exploding the bottom of the pan they get nice and crispy next my black olives now white wine mmm bring that up to the boil deglazing the pan as well i rinse in the bottom of that pan and now the flavor in there it's just extraordinary now where that tomatoes [Music] puncher plum tomatoes [Music] then simply place the lamb breast back in the pot and remember to taste [Music] that's nice [Music] lid on into the oven 170 two two and a half hours and forget about it [Music] whoa beautiful all that has reduced down to this amazing nice tomato sauce and the lamb has kept its color look at that it's braised beautifully very carefully get your little bits there slice off pull off the little bits of string this is why i get really excited the secret is not to slice it too thinly look at that i can smell the lemon it's hard to believe when you slice through the center there that that is a very cheap cut of meat i'm salivating i love this i mean it's just incredible pick up the tomatoes and the olives and the onions amazing rich sauce take your lamp sort of just sit it on it looks incredible and that for me is why chefs get so excited with cheap cuts because the end results are incredible delicious breast of lamb with lemon anchovies chili and oregano [Music] slow cooking is a fantastic way to develop delicious deep flavors here are three of my easy one pot wonders minimum preparation long cook and an amazing wonderful taste first up easy bolito misto a classic italian mixed meat dish [Music] i'm starting with some italian fennel sausages [Music] fry them until coloured making sure all sides are nicely browned set them aside then slice drizzo a spicy spanish sausage with a wonderful smoky taste and fry it so it releases all its incredible flavour [Music] next chop carrots celery garlic and add to the same pan this keeps in all the flavor stir in the pre-lentils these are excellent for slow cooked dishes because they retain their firm texture and shape next add a bay leaf and some fresh thyme sprigs then the sausages go back in along with chicken stock simmer until the lentils are tender then season to taste [Music] finely sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve simple to prepare a cinch to make and packed full of delicious hearty flavors my twist on an italian classic magnificent easy bolito mister [Music] my next everyday effortless dish is slow cooked aubergine dice the aubergine and fry in hot olive oil until colored on all sides then add a finely sliced onion and chop garlic cook until tender add cooked butter beans and pomegranate molasses which is a sweet thick and glossy tangy reduction of pomegranate juice season [Music] next add a can of chopped tomatoes bring to a simmer and cook until the aubergine has a gloriously soft and silky texture stir through chopped mint pile onto toasted bread and finally for a lovely salty tang crumble over some creamy feta cheese minimum preparation but slow cooked for maximum flavor aubergines like you've never tasted before [Music] one more dish that uses time to transform a humble ingredient is perfect slow cooked beef [Music] start by frying the beef shin in hot oil seasoning as you go this is a very economical cut of beef as it slow cooks it also makes the most delicious gravy as the marrow thickens and flavors the sauce [Music] in the same pan sausage chopped carrots peeled whole shallots sliced celery peeled and chopped ginger and garlic next add tomato puree and cook for a few minutes [Music] add the shin back into the pan with a glass of dry white wine and the juice of an orange this deglazes the pan adding incredible depth of flavor pour in chicken stock season and simmer for an hour and 20 minutes this dish is brilliant finished with gremolata a dry italian salsa made with chopped herbs simply chop

essential guide to kitchen equipment everything you need to know about the basic kit that will get you cooking fantastic food casserole dish absolutely essential when it comes to good home cooking why so versatile the beauty of this thing is the fact that you can actually use it on the hob or start it on the hob and finish in the oven more importantly cast iron it conducts the heat so you can have

and if you look after it it will last you a lifetime brilliant for one pot wonders welcome back to my ultimate cookery course [Music] i'm teaching you my slow cooked favorites next up my guide to getting the best value from your butchers one of the biggest bills in the kitchen is going to be for meat so it's crucial you keep costs down but that doesn't mean sacrificing flavor especially when you use some slow cooking magic to get the best from cheap cuts to get value for money it always pays to ask an expert and fifth generation award-winning master butcher danny lydgate is a man in the know one of the great things about going to a butcher is they're going to have more cuts available than most supermarkets so you're going to see things that people don't know about so one example might be the beef ribs a great product for slow cooking in the oven especially cooking on the bone you're going to get more flavors from the bone there's some really nice pieces of juicy meat these only used for mints in the past now people are using it for braising or slow braising or even barbecuing it with some really nice marinades the ox tail are less popular now than maybe they used to be small little mussels make up the tail once that's slow cooked they all fall apart really tender juicy meat also oxtail is sublime in stews curries and soups another great cheap cut for slow cooking is one you saw me using earlier lambs breast [Music] it's one of the least expensive cuts of lamb and it's also delicious slow roasted or stewed here we have the shin of beef where you can see in the shins made up of lots of little different mussels these are always moving always doing work so slow cooking will give the best end results it's going to have fashion a little bit but it should be enjoyed by everybody it's a fantastic piece of meat here we have some ox cheeks and when they're trimmed you end up with a really lean piece of meat obviously with the cheek the cow's always eating munching on grass this means they need a lot of cooking but essentially it's a really nice healthy lean piece of meat with fantastic flavors ox cheeks also make an incredible ravioli or ragu and if you're a pork lover why not try pork neck it's a succulent alternative for a slow sunday roast here we have a mussel from the shoulder it's called feather blades the reason it's called feather blades because when it's cut each piece looks like a feather the gristle tends to be slow cooked and the more it's cooked will turn gelatinous giving a lovely jelly and juicy liquid to the meat fantastic for casseroling pies and stews there are so many cheaper cuts which are brilliant for home cooking it's important with all these forgotten cuts to find out how to cook them don't be scared of them they're really economic but full of flavor and the end result is fantastic meal as a chef one of the biggest kicks i get is taking an ingredient that doesn't cost much and turning into something that looks and tastes like a million bucks my next recipe turns what used to be a decidedly unfashionable cut of meat into the star of the dish fit to grace any table slow roasted pork belly with fennel [Music] slow roasting works better on fattier tougher and unfashionable cuts whether it's a cheek or even a neck or this amazing pork belly it's a fantastic way to transform cheap cuts into amazing melting perfection take a very sharp knife bring the pork belly towards you so you're over it and you've got all that pressure and weight using the tip of the knife i'm just sort of nicking it and go across the pork belly long strokes with a knife take your time turn it 180. this time what we're doing is just sort of cutting these nice little sort of diamonds but as that starts roasting on top it starts getting nice and crispy take little handfuls of salt and just sort of rub it in bend it over in all those cracks really helps to get a nice crisp crackling on top roasting tray getting really nice and hot take a hole over fennel to intensify flavor and to keep the meat succulent i'm braising my pork belly with strong vibrant spices and vegetables crush and peel three whole cloves of garlic and add to the fennel olive oil in fennel in like the nice strong antique flavor that goes with that nice rich dense pork fennel seeds delicious star anise in and just a couple of cardamom seeds and wow they're like little bangers like little firecrackers incredible lovely fresh bay leaves get your pork skin side down just sear the top of that fat that locks in all that amazing flavor then i'm going to flip it over and get it nice and crispy and then i want fennel seeds embedded in those little cracks now some white wine the minute that white wine hits that pan you can smell that light fragrance from the fennel allow the wine to bubble away and reduce until the alcohol has burnt off time that the stock now the stock goes in just underneath the skin so it roasts on top all that meat under there will be submerged because what happens in the oven the top goes crispy as anything and the stock reduces and braises at the same time really importantly bring that back up to the ball before it goes in the oven otherwise it will never boil never get up to temperature smells incredible slow roast a pork belly at 180 degrees for two and a half hours [Music] look at that you've got that nice crispy skin on top you can see how much of the stock has evaporated put that onto the board it looks stunning make a delicious rustic sauce with the flavor packed contents of the roasting tray first get rid of the excess fat take a couple of slices of bread it's like a perfect sponge because you just lay that on top and drag it almost like a net and it just absorbs all that fat if you want the perfect fried bread trust me stick that in a frying pan a nice teaspoon of mustard whisk that in and then simply simmer for a few minutes before pouring into a serving jug with your pork belly always use a nice serrated edge knife you can hear that that is amazing incredibly tender that belly of pork is gonna almost melt in your mouth you've got that sweet meat under that crispy belly of pork what an amazing way to cook a very cheap cut of meat [Music] next my tricks of the trade and kitchen tips first how to make a fantastic chicken stock a classic slow cook recipe that gets amazing flavor from simple ingredients chicken stock the vital ingredient to good cooking it transforms sauces it's a fantastic base for soups and more importantly it's so easy to do a little bit of love and care at the beginning and it cooks itself right step one chicken carcass into a pie sided an onion doesn't need to be finely chopped the vegetables flavor the stock onion in then from there cut your leek into nice big solid chunks roughly same size as the onion so the vegetables cook at the same time and then our carrot celery in garlic and then a nice sprig of thyme that helps to really give depth of flavor to the chicken stock a couple of bay leaves and some fresh parsley and then peppercorns pan and just lightly crush them and a little pinch of salt and now just cover the vegetables and the carcass with cold water just cover the chicken and the vegetables bring it up to the ball as quick as you can now as it comes into the boil a really nice skin take the base of the ladle and swirl that around that pushes all the grease and the impurities to the side of the pan then get your ladle and just tilt it if you don't skim all that off the stock becomes very cloudy people's impression of cooking stock that it needs to cook for three four hours at a time this is one chicken carcass let that boil away gently for 30 to 40 minutes maximum now we're going to pass it off take a sieve place that over the pan and then just pour that in it smells amazing it's aromatic the color is absolutely beautiful and there you have the most amazing stock when you need to season meat in flour a great tip is to place it in a plastic bag to dust it evenly using flour also helps the sauce to get nice and thick during cooking when browning meat fry in small batches don't crowd the pan otherwise it won't sear or color properly when slow roasting meat line the bottom of the roasting tray with chunky vegetables like onions fennel and carrots they act as a trivet to keep the meat from boiling in its own juices plus the veg can be the base for your gravy later on after slow cooking baked on residue can be tough to remove but if you boil water in the pan it will dissolve and break down then simply pour out and wash with soap and water [Music] follow my ultimate cookery course crammed with key lessons top tips and 100 recipes to stake your life on and you'll literally be cooking yourself

what an ashram spiritual retreat you are going to go and live there with monks there's a lot of fabulous vegetarian food there i'm not spending all week and my last sort of exciting week as a vegetarian no chance now i'm going now the whole week no you're going to go back with a journey not just to india but into yourself i am not [ __ ] amy winehouse's husband i'm not checking into rehab you're not checking in rehab you're going to find yourself you are in our country you are our guest you are like god the god in me salutes the god of you have a great time good lord be with you the lord jesus and call me if you need me uh yes absolutely [Music] i've heard his cooking is the best in the state it's not the kind of transport expected to use to get around no people always have this idea being holy means being impractical yes yeah that's right i have a wife and 1 million children guru's ashram is the aisha center it gets over 700 000 visitors a year he's a popular maharishi and he's looking a bit more serious now i'm very excited to be here more nervous than excited i'm never gone two days of my life without eating meat your system is essentially designed to handle vegetarian diet right if you eat according to that it it handles food effortlessly yes every human experience has a chemical basis in the system right so if you want to create the right kind of chemistry there are various things that one can do yes one of the things is food if you create a chemistry of blissfulness that's how you are all the time that's impossible i'm not going to argue in your temple that's for sure i'm dying to see the kitchens let's go thank you so the guru reckons being vegetarian makes you a joyful karma person if that's true then these kitchens must be amongst the happiest places on earth the size of this place wow it's a veggie hangout look at those vegetables are they grown are they grown here a bit of it that's incredible okay and here are the lychees i'd love one please thank you how long are you here for um for a while you're baking the fundamental rule nobody ever eats in the kitchen before the food is being offered to everybody they never eat you can't eat around food we're always picking in kitchens no fancy a cucumber fancy eliji you gave me it got me into trouble we're not allowed to eat in the kitchen how many meals would you be cooking for today seven thousand vegetarian meals well that breaks my heart the 70 chefs are mostly unpaid volunteers who work seven days on the truck feeding visitors to the ashram where's the meat section the meat is here this is the meat so what is this section they are making a special type of chapati seven thousand in for dinner tonight and look how calm it is how come the kitchen's so calm because they're not eating meat right because this is the heron's kitchen heaven's kitchen not hell's kitchen i like that the guru's disciples eat in a communal dining hall in total silence men and women sit in separate lines tonight's menu is a raw salad of red cabbage and sweet corn tomato chutney with lentils and cottage cheese it's not exactly silver service eating in silence isn't easy for someone like me fortunately i've made a new friend you can even keep your feet to the sidelines that's fine i'll try and cross the card another way just stretch both your legs out yes and sit like this this is called grandmother's style grandmother's side it's incredible i feel so bad i can't cross my legs there notice if you uh the kind of food that you eat also makes the body loose and flexible as well so you're saying if i become a vegetarian my body will become a lot more veg a lot more flexible possibilities i can't i can sit down i can't get to my food you can just hold your certain of course thank you food is actually delicious what amazes me is not just the level integrity but the volume of what they cook for because it's done with such precision you ever ask for more yesterday was a surprise but i've not been turned into a veggie disciple yet [Music] we've not had breakfast yet the guru is cooking his speciality the popular masala dosa is a pancake made with dal and rice batter that smells good smells very good smiley fermented that's the potato it's an art to get the dosa right because you have to ferment it to exactly the right proportions that's delicious very crispy see this is a pepper curry you just try a little bit of it the pepper comes straight from our backyard it's organically grown thank you try this and see it could be a little spicy for you yeah no i like that i've been won over by the delicious food but i'm not yet convinced by the guru's reasoning for me a vegetable a vegetable is as alive as a chicken or a lamb or whatever else wrong it is not wrong are you saying that a carrot has the same feelings as a chicken that's not the point feelings does not mean emotions they are sensitive to life around them yes you understand but you killed it you pulled it from the ground you pulled it from the ground but it's not dead if you plant it it'll grow you take such a high moral ground in terms of no meat eating whatsoever food is not a morality food is a question of well-being so you saying that i would be happier for the second half of my life without eating meat you will be calmer and more more at ease but i am calm i am i don't think the world thinks so about your calmness you wouldn't know you don't have any televisions here [Laughter] let's agree to disagree yes spud potato love it thank you have a lovely breakfast thank you it's taken a long time but you heard it here first i'm calling a ceasefire with vegetarians if you're ever thinking of going vegetarian then get to an ashram quickly because that's the confirmation of how good it can be but he is [ __ ] nuts i think he's gesticulating much less than yesterday don't you notice that his body movements are little first of all i'm definitely more chilled out there's no ways about that um yeah it has been an experience you

#GordonRamsay #Cooking #Food #BBQ

Pre-order...",2022-12-01 22:16:02.926159, if you want a new twist on a favorite dish spice it up with chili my next recipe is super simple to make but has wonderful depth and complexity of flavors spicy beef salad chilis if you use them confidently they can really add a new dimension to the style of cooking but the real trick is finding that balance of flavors that really suits you because that's the most important part so this is the most amazing sirloin you can see it's got that wonderful marble for me the secret behind this is cooking it quickly season the steaks generously salt and pepper push that seasoning in to the sirloin take the sirloin out the fridge literally 20 minutes before you want to cook them so it gets up to room temperature they cook more evenly but more importantly you can actually season right inside the steak this little bit of fat down here season that as well because that is what we want to roast and get that really nice and rendered olive oil in a tablespoon roll that round as it starts to smoke in with the steaks into the pan and lay away again into the pan and lay away if you don't hear that noise the minute those steaks hit the pan don't put them in so the secret now is getting that color on the steak turning it once and once only and cooking it for two and a half minutes each side what i want to do is to get that bit of fat rendered so it adds a lot more flavor just hold the steak down like that and that starts to melt the fat which makes it so much more tender there should be no white fat left anywhere turn them over really important to have that steak up to room temperature before you start cooking it so the inside is nice and warm so we spend less time in the pan and more time cooling down really important now two fingers touch it goes in it says rare i'm happy for them to be rare because by the time i let them rest they're going to go back to medium rare it'll continue cooking out onto a plate and let them rest one to just get my juices over don't waste that really important next the spicy dressing take the seeds out of the chili to reduce the heat by rubbing it in your hands and tapping until the seeds fall out cut it in half and just chop it in garlic and chilli works brilliantly a quick way of peeling it get your knife and just slam it down pops out very very quickly in a little touch of salt rub start going around in circles first you'll see it puring nice clear that off now we've got the heat in there from the chilli and that richness from the garlic two teaspoons of palm sugar this is where it starts to have that nice sweet sour effect fish sauce fresh lime this is a simple fresh chili dressing and it was something i fell in love with in vietnam and cambodia because it was just so easy give that a little mix and dissolve the sugar quick taste wow right vegetables a great fuss-free way to get super thin ribbons of carrot is to use a veg peeler when they're that thin they take the vinaigrette so much better and radishes just slice them down at an angle lovely to give another dimension to the salad i'm gonna use a banana shallot they are incredibly mellow very sweet across just chop up the shallot and mix that through want some sweetness in there now little vine tomatoes slice them in half smarter's in shallot radish carrots and tomatoes next peel and slice cucumber chopped spring onions and shred baby gem lettuce and then finally get some fresh mint it's young men so you don't need to take all those stalks off all you do is hold the bunch upside down and then take it for a little trim and just chop that once through look at that nice minted salad a couple of tablespoons of dressing don't flood the salad with a dressing you can always add but we can't take it away now really mix that dressing in there make sure all that chili and garlic and palm sugar wraps around that salad beautiful onto the plate the steak's rested it's now nice and medium rare that little bit of fat we don't want to find that in the salad just slice that off that serves its purpose it's kept that steak nice and moist just slice going with the grain it's almost like slicing through butter and look inside beautiful pink you slice the beef too thinly then it goes stone cold and more importantly all the goodness runs out of it nice thick slices get the beef and start placing it around the salad take a little teaspoon of your dressing the rest of your salad sip that on top and finish it off with some toasted peanuts peanuts in now those nuts are really toasted nuts on get another pan and just crush once they've cooled down just run them through with a knife you can hear how crunchy they are another texture another taste the salad and then from there sprinkle and then finally take that just finish it with a little tablespoon of that sauce and there is one tasty very well textured spicy beef salad [Music] cooking dishes in advance is a brilliant way of taking the stress out of cooking at home and many dishes just get better and better with time first up my amazing sticky pork ribs one of the secrets to great cooking is patience leaving dishes to marinade for one or two days helps to develop the flavor in your food and the end result so much more delicious it's a method i use in the restaurants all the time first off get your roasting tray put the tray on the gas pork ribs 60 meat and 35 40 fat give them a really good season salt and pepper nice thing about this cut they stay incredibly moist when they're on the bone and the longer you cook them the more delicious they become and just push all that seasoning in to the pork olive oil in make sure that tray is nice and hot and i really want that nice sort of caramelization taking place on the pork that's the nice thing about starting it on top of the stove use your roasting tray get them colored and then the oven putting the ribs straight in the oven you don't get the color it looks sort of boiled as opposed to a nice caramelized rib ginger you can't beat fresh ginger with sticky pork ribs place it down nice and firmly and slice the thinner you slice the ginger the more fragrant the ribs garlic and it's really important before you add anything those ribs make sure you've got the color from the ribs first don't rush it turn them over that's what i want that nice crispy color as they sort of braise in the oven all that color just turns into the most amazing flavor braising is just a chef's turn for cooking something slowly in liquid right ginger and garlic in spread it around on all those ribs to sort of roast the ginger and the garlic chili flakes chili flakes in next szechuan pepper citrusy vibrant peppercorns incredible in next star anise that gives it a really nice sort of aniseedy flavor almost like you're roasting the ribs in fennel and now we've got the heat got the spice i want to sweeten things up a little bit some fresh honey honey glazes the pork beautifully counteracts against all that spice in there but look what's happening a color on the ribs is extraordinary it's like a really nice chili sweet caramel now soy sauce brings that little bit of sort of saltiness to it really generous with the soy sauce japanese vinegar two tablespoons of vinegar in rice wine it gives it that nice sort of um tartness to the ribs if you can't find rice wine our dry sherry's a great substitute 300 mil that takes out the heat of that sichuan pepper those dry chili flakes make sure they're all laid down like a nice tight box of matches bring that up to the boil cooking is all about learning to develop your own likes and dislikes so always keep tasting to make sure you're happy with the combination of flavors it's lacking a little touch of vinegar what that sharpness now think what's going on the tartness the heat the caramel the colour on the ribs is amazing i want a bit of a sort of oniony flavor put some spring onions in whilst these ribs are in the oven the spring onions will sort of puree they give a sharpness the final taste of that pork in with my spring onions and with my stock 400 ml of stock this is just a simple chicken stock the stock just sits underneath the ribs it absorbs into the rib and the top of the rib glazes underneath the rib that gets crispy and rich and that's what makes the ribs nice and moist really important into the oven cook at 180 for 30 minutes then turn the ribs over and cook for a further 30 minutes [Music] now wow they smell incredible each side has got that really nice crispy roasted edge becomes sticky and chewy and sweet sour the fats disappeared and the pork just melts in your mouth i want to take them to the next level gas back on now shake the tray and this is the sort of the way that we finish them in the restaurant every minute they glaze in that tray they just get to taste better and better now look at them i'm so happy with those ribs done absolutely delicious now but if you want you can put them in the fridge and the flavor will keep developing then just reheat them when you want to serve so [Music] each rib has a nice slice of ginger on there wow look at that delicious sticky ribs with an amazing marinade [Music] there's a wealth of classic fast food dishes we know and love from hot dogs and kebabs to tacos and burgers but the great thing about making them at home is you can throw away the rule book and get creative my next easy recipe is a miniature version of an american favorite the burger smoky pork sliders with barbecue sauce everyone loves a burger they're a true fast food original and that's the exciting thing about street food you can take an old classic like that and reinvent it into something really exciting when you think of a burger what you need is a great sauce and unlike smoky barbecue it goes hand in glove with a great burger start by finely chopping one onion and three cloves of garlic nice hot pan tablespoon of olive oil onions and garlic into the pan nice seasoning salt and pepper now the secret of a good barbecue sauce is that really important caramelization to begin with a nice tablespoon of brown sugar it darkens the onions but it really starts to sort of give that nice syrupy body to the sauce and put a little bit of heat in there now a nice teaspoon of smoked paprika that's the important part of working with spices you've got to cook them out and almost sort of burn off that rawness especially with a smoked paprika that's exactly where i want it to go onions and garlic beauty caramelized cider vinegar in reduce that down now i've got a fantastic smoky base to complete the sauce i'm making my life really easy and adding pre-made worcester sauce and tomato ketchup cook that out for two to three minutes now depending on how thick you like the barbecue sauce that determines how long you cook it out for i don't want it to be too runny but i don't want it too thick either that's the consistency we're looking for lovely turn down the gas charger seasoning now take that out it's the kind of sauce that i like to have sort of bottled up in the fridge it's great for sandwiches but goes brilliantly well with these sliders homemade smoky barbecue sauce give the pan a little wipe now start the mix for the sliders to give my mix a really interesting flavor and texture i'm gonna be using unsmoked back bacon i travel all over the world and i spend a lot of time in the states they know how to make a great slider pork sliders beef sliders chicken sliders and it's almost like a way of having a burger but on a much smaller miniature level little teaspoon of olive oil i want that bacon to get really nice and crispy bacon in this just gives the really nice sort of chunky delicious mix i want texture and pork is perfect for slider [Music] and choppy shallot shallots are a lot sweeter than your normal white onion fine fine fine and then [Music] now that bacon's getting really nice and crispy i want a bit of heat in there a little teaspoon of smoked paprika in there when you see these sliders in the states for one portion there's like four or five of them little mini one biters incredible now take your pork just open up and give that a really nice seasoning so important you can't season a slider after you've cooked it it's impossible so season it nicely bake now that's nice and crispy just take a little touch kitchen roll and just drain that off there nice pat that nice and dry i want all that nice sort of crispiness in there beautiful mix all that in take a nice ball and sort of roll it the size of a golf ball get it nice and round first and then three fingers just pat that down don't flatten them too thin otherwise they overcook and they go sort of dry because sliders are bite-sized burgers designed to go in small buns you don't want to make them too big good get the pan nice and hot a tablespoon of olive oil when a slider is literally that thick about an inch thick we're going to take two and a half to three minutes to each side in turn them over lovely once you've turned them tilt the pan and just spoon all that juice back into them keep my mouth watering now very easy to dry the pork out so just feeling it now your fingers is nice and firm it's a little touch of springiness in the center i'm happy with those add your cheese now so it gets nicely melted i'm using wedgies of smoked cheddar and it has that nice sort of soury smoky creaminess to the slider finally shredded baby gem lettuce just take those buns make sure they're sliced nice and evenly take your lettuce be quite generous with the lettuce just a nice thin slice of tomato take your burgers you see that cheese you feed melted your bbq sauce place the top on and that is my version the slider that is small dynamic but packed full of flavor i'll take that over a hamburger any day you

Pre-order your copy of Ramsay in 10 here - https://linktr.ee/RamsayIn10...",2022-11-30 22:16:02.926159, [Music] welcome to my ultimate cookery course packed with quick cooking tips know-how and 100 recipes to take your life on okay get ready for my ultimate guide to bacon [Music] whether it's breads cakes tarts pies or pastries bacon is one of the most seductive skills in the kitchen it fills the house with fantastic aromas and puts irresistible food on the table now i'm gonna put you on the road to bacon nirvana starting with an easy bread packed with big gutsy flavors olive tomato and rosemary for catcher i absolutely love bacon bread there's something really satisfying about doing it and this focaccia recipe is very hands-on but the end result is something really really tasty first off start with the dough tip 500 grams of strong bread flour into a mixing bowl and add 20 grams of semolina that gives the vacation it's sort of rustic charm now there's one thing for catcher needs it's really good seasoning you can't season bread after it's baked so it's got to go in right at the very beginning sprinkling 15 grams of dried yeast take some warm water and then 50 mils of olive oil top of that water that gives it this really nice silky rich texture make a little well mix up that yeast water and oil in start off with your fingers keep your fingers nice and open it's like a little sort of whisk going in there i'm looking for a really nice sort of relaxed dough now that's just starting to come together touch more water with oil in there give a little swirl and then again the secret is to sort of knead it gently don't overwork it it's a sort of easy bread to make a nice one to start off with when you're making bread for the first time basically kneading means just knit it together just hanging lightly flour your board and let's just knead that for catcher into a nice smooth dough make sure you don't over add too much flour otherwise it sort of dries out the dough something quite magical about making bread you can switch off and lose yourself my first job for a three-mission style establishment was a baker i was 22 years of age and to start at midnight i was under such a tight schedule one o'clock white bread then two o'clock brown bread three o'clock sourdough four o'clock cheese bread five o'clock proof bake six o'clock crack them open and taste it was amazing beautiful yeah looks stunning it hasn't even risen yet leave your dough to rise in a warm place until it's doubled in size we call this proving [Music] that beautiful a lot of chefs sort of need it for the second time but i'm looking for a really nice light aerated for catcher take your tray a touch of olive oil in there season it at the bottom really important that's the exciting thing about focaccia you've got that really nice sort of salty top and salty bottom and just with a touch of olive oil on your hands gently push that in and almost massage it into the corners it's possible to put sort of olives and tomatoes and garlic through the dough but it never really allows the dough to sort of aerate properly when you put so much ingredients in i'm gonna stick mine on top use your finger and sort of just push them in salt on top some pepper on top as well i want some nice fresh amazing rosemary just hold the stalk and just pull off and then just sprinkle down generous in the rosemary really important to have that nice fragrance on top of the fuckacha finish it off before it goes in with a little drizzle of olive oil so it almost sinks in those little pockets of flavor olive tomato rosemary and olive oil into the oven bake your focaccia at 200 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes [Music] smells delicious beautiful [Music] you can hear how crispy that is you can't beat a nice warm fresh slice of home-cooked focaccia it's rustic charming and it's the perfect way to start bacon making homemade for catcher it's so addictive getting to grips with bacon is

now it's all about bacon i'm going to show you how to make a sponge cake smothered in luxury so nice to finish something sweet on top but first my guide to getting the best ingredients for your money whether i'm doing a simple sponge cake or make an elaborate tart i want my bacon to be the best it can be so i always start with the best ingredients i can find knowledge is crucial the more you know personally about where your ingredients are from and how they produce the better [Applause] [Music] flour to get the low down on one of the key ingredients to brilliant baking it always pays to ask an expert and if there's one man who can really rise to the occasion it's professional miller mark abel doing a job like this means that you end up thinking and living a flower if that's obsession i'm obsessed [Music] at his mill which has stood in norfolk since 1835 mark uses traditional stones to grind his flower so he really knows his stuff [Music] what actually comes off the field is something like this still husked still needs to be processed before we can actually mill it we then clean down to something like this which is ready to be milled [Music] all this is a great big machine which means you don't have to do it by hand rather than try and improve its performance by adding additional chemicals what we're trying to do is mill it in the best way to get that performance from it [Music] if you can put a seed in between stones you can make flour out of it uh it's that simple barley was what was traditionally used to make bread for people to live off oats can be used as well and of course good old spelt the great grandmother of modern wheats which has the most fantastic flavor and is because of its primitive nature the proteins in it are simpler so a lot of people can eat that they can't eat modern weight keep your eyes on the shelves look and see what is there and if something strikes you as being potentially interesting then get it and try it mix your own blend your own together so that you can get the flavour that you want with the performance that you want [Music] mark's right different flowers performance tastes wildly different and so they're well worth trying out here's my quick guide to some of the flowers i like using strong flour is one to choose for standard bread making the higher the protein content the crust your loaf will be the flour hailing from italy double zero it's super finely milled and perfect for pasta i like to use it for pizzas too because it produces a nice crispy crust like the one on my mozzarella and rosemary version rye flour will give you really dense fruity flavored bread fruit cakes or scones if it's too heavy for you just mix it with standard wheat flour and when you are baking remember that self-raising flour is just plain flour with raisin asians added so if you run out you can add baking powder and salt to your plain flour and get baking [Music] that's the real stuff that's it fresh flour straight out the mill is so superior in flavor and performance that is only when you come to use it you realize what the difference is if you're going to experiment with ingredients in baking you still need to follow some basic rules to make sure things turn out brilliantly every time then whether you're a master baker or you're just starting out you can pimp up the classics whether it's a victoria sponge or a fruit scone and that's the lesson perfectly illustrated by my next recipe sponge with fresh ginger bacon is part chemistry part imagination but you've got to rely on the rules for great results it's the only time you'll see me reaching for the scales first off eggs sugar butter and when i say weigh out the ingredients it does literally mean way out to the final gram 175 now 175 grams of sugar that's 350 grams in total cream the butter and the sugar to get a delicious light sponge start carefully on slow speed [Music] only speed up as the butter and sugar really start to cream together keep that really nice and light you can see how it's changed color so important at the beginning eggs in give a little whisk adding one egg at a time stops the mix from separating second again third one in [Music] that's what we're looking for a really nice sort of light airaidy texture now gonna flavor the sponge a little teaspoon of vanilla extract that perfumes the mix one teaspoon of baking powder that gives lightness 175 grams of flour and we're gonna sieve it a to get rid of any lumps and b to keep it really nice and fine 175. we're not gonna beat that out we're just gonna lightly fold that in now what i'm looking for is a really nice loose dough that's looking a little bit too firm so just a little splash of milk a couple of tablespoons that relaxes the mixture down helps create that nice almost dropping consistency that's what i want just starting to drop take a non-stick loose bottom cake tin grease it with butter then coat it with flour to avoid the sponge sticking just give that a little shake make sure you get all the rim now just get the back of the spatula make sure you've got no peaks on my sponge to make sure the sponge bakes nice and evenly tap the tin a few times to knock out any air pockets that might have formed in the mixture now into the oven bake for 30 to 35 minutes at 180 degrees as that's cooking prepare the ginger cream for the center 300ml of cream give that a nice whisk whisking cream by hand gives you so much more control and it's so easy to over whip cream i want that nice light ginger cream in the center i don't want it grainy nothing worse when cream starts to separate now let's get into that three-quarter stage little stiff peaks stop that for two minutes fresh ginger now get a really nice large slice of ginger smells incredible it's so fragrant eating ginger is like sort of peeling a potato just take out all those little dark spots now get your grater you haven't got a grater you can chop the ginger really finely have gone almost like a puree of ginger going through but the juice as well take your knife and just scrape all that taste incredible it's fragrant and it's not sweet it's got a really nice taste set that in the fridge [Music] smells incredible run a knife around the outside to ensure the cake doesn't stick to the tin before turning it out now get your hands under push up and out while your cake cools i'm gonna do like a really nice sweet chocolate coating pour 300 mils of double cream into a saucepan add two tablespoons of golden syrup to make the top nice and glossy then whisk chop this up really thinly so as it melts quickly 50 grams of butter that's gonna give the chocolate a really nice shine ball your cream and mix it in give that a really good stir as the chocolate the butter melts it thickens like how shiny that is so nice to finish something sweet on top topping done time to build your sponge cake look at the halfway mark there and just gently slice and really take your time all the way through lift that's delicious that nice big dollop in the middle don't be stingy don't be tight with a cream another dollop on top spread that very carefully lift the lid and just sit there on top that's why i start off with a little extra cream in there so when i squash it down the cream just pushes out to the side i'm not finished pour the luxurious chocolate topping over the sponge be generous and make sure the cake is coated thoroughly to give it a gorgeous finish get the bottom of the ladle and spread whoa one more [Music] wow you've got to know when to say stop and something looks that delicious i just want to dive in there [Music] next five more my 100 tips to help you cook better and of course these are all about bacon kicking off with how to whip cream whipping cream now the important part here is whipping the cream to a three-quarter stage if we over whip it it will split so be very careful double cream in now when we whisk things we whisk it in the shape of a figure of eight and if you spin the bowl as you whip the cream you get to release it from the bottom so it whips evenly whisk whisk whisk and it should just sit inside the whisk and start to sort of fall out just perfect three-quarter stage double cream done room temperature cream whips much faster than cold so you'll need to take your cream out of the fridge 30 minutes before you want to whip it unless of course you want to work on your biceps a great tip to prevent milk and cream from boiling over in a saucepan is to simply lay a wooden spoon across the top the cream bubbles will rise up and hit the wooden handle and then fall back into the pan instead of bubbling over sticky stuff like trinkle and golden syrup can be a real mess to measure out my tip is to rub the spoon with a neutral oil like rave seed and any sticky ingredients will slide straight off [Music] and my tip for greasing cake tins is to keep old butter wrappers on hand and use them to crease when needed [Music] follow my ultimate cookery course packed with key lessons top tips and 100 recipes to stay your life on and you'll literally be cooking yourself into a better chef many of these amazing recipes are on my app please check out the app store for details go on get cooking okay this time i'm gonna help you achieve better bacon the great thing about pastry is if you follow the basic rules the possibilities are endless whether it's simple short crust or flaky filo you just need a bit of practice to get it right my first recipe uses lovely buttery shortcuts pastry to make a dish that's as delicious as it is simple leek and pancetta quiche shortcuts pastry is one of the staples of the kitchen it is so versatile but the good news is it's one of the easiest pastries to make trust me when you crack it it can make a real difference to your cooking take a sieve when you think of short crust pastry it's sort of semi-flaky but it's rich buttery start by sipping 200 grams of plain flour into a mixing bowl large pinch of salt 200 grams of unsalted butter bring the butter up to room temperature if you let the butter become too soft then the flour so it doesn't absorb it in with your fingers rub together first now the secret is grab big handfuls and squeeze the butter into the flour so look what's happened literally in 30 seconds i've got that nice crumbly texture now a couple of tablespoons of water nothing worse when the pastry is so wet you can't bring it together it needs to shape like a nice rich cookie dough it's just a touch too dry so one more tablespoon of water [Music] and there you go it's coming nicely now that's what i want a nice sort of firm ball of pastry onto the board i'm gonna use these one of the strongest parts of the body pull towards you and push back down use those wrists to really knead it together so just that nice sort of smooth texture now wrap it in clin film set there in the fridge for 20 minutes really important that you let the shortcuts pastry relax [Music] now to make the quiche you can use just an ordinary flan dish but i love making them in many frying pans which give them an extra rustic charm brush with oil to stop the pastry from sticking once the pastry is at room temperature roll it out to a nice even thickness place it in the center of your little pan turn it in don't use your fingers because what we don't want is any holes in this just get a little bit of dough because that sort of acts like a little sort of mallet flattens it out nicely i'm building a sort of extra lip because that way i can get the filling it's absolute maximum levels we're going to cook them blind first to blind bake simply means to pre-cook your pastry before adding the filling this ensures you'll have a fantastic crisp pastry add a sheet of foil or baking paper and weigh it down you can use rice pulses or ceramic baking stones just make sure you keep them for the next time in the oven 200 degrees for 10 minutes now for the filling i'm gonna do a classic quiche bacon and leeks this is a amazing cured pancetta pancetta is an italian cured meat made from belly pork seasoning with things like juniper nutmeg fennel a great substitute is unsmoked bacon as the manchetta gets lovely and crispy finely slice leeks and add oh leeks and bacon nice really important to cook those leeks down it's exactly what i want those leeks are almost sort of caramelized slightly crispy the flavor is amazing and just drain them off so any excess fat gets drained a couple of tablespoons of cream it gives it a really nice richness i want two-thirds garnish i.e bacon and leeks in my quiche and one-third of the savory custard a touch of salt touch a pepper and i grate some gruyere cheese that makes a really nice sort of creamy less of an eggy quiche take my amazing crispy pancetta and leeks in give that a good mix needs one more little thing some freshness flat leaf parsley incredible really important just to taste the mixture with the quiche filling ready next finish off the pastry [Music] remove the fall and weight and return to the oven to get it lovely and golden all over [Music] now when we fill them give that a really good mix up [Music] beautiful grate over some more cheese which will bubble up and melt beautifully and then into the oven bake your quiche for 15 to 20 minutes [Music] incredible it's got that nice sort of cheese and toast smell from the top it's sort of baked but the secret of any good quiche is in the short crust because that's the hero there are lots of different types of pastry so to help you put you on the road to pace your perfection here are three of my simple pastel recipes that you can easily cook at home first up my indulgent chocolate tarts [Music] first combine softened butter and sugar and cream until soft [Music] break in an egg and mix well next fold in the flour [Music] pour the mixture onto a floured surface and simply knead it lightly till it's well combined then shape into a disc and chill then simply roll out your pastry until it's about a quarter of a centimetre thick cut into small discs then gently press into lightly greased loose bottom mini tart tins and prick the bottom to prevent the pastry from bubbling rest in the fridge this ensures that when the pastry bakes it will turn out nice and soft then bake it till golden as they cool make the gorgeous silky chocolate filling place a mixing bowl over a pan of gently boiling water this is known as a bain-marie then add double cream butter and plain chocolate then stir until it melts and it is glossy and smooth then pour it into the crisp and golden pastry cases and simply tap to level and chill until set so easy so indulgent and so delicious eat them with creme fraiche ice cream or simply by themselves perfect my next dish is an irresistible take on a latin american classic beef empanadas first finely chop onion and garlic sweat in a pan of hot olive oil until tender add paprika cinnamon and cumin and stir cooking the spices off intensifies the flavor add beef mince to the pan brown and season add chili flakes for a fiery kick next dried oregano chopped green olives and chopped boiled eggs once it's mixed through set aside to cool for the empanada cases roll out puff pastry this stuff's so time consuming to make at home so do what i do cheat and use shop bought cut into disks spoon the mixture into one half of the disk leaving roughly a centimeter border around the edge brush the edge of one half of the disc with egg and fold it over crimp the edges with your fingers to seal and remove air pockets then simply cook in a medium oven until golden brown super easy super quick and super tasty serve a chimichurri a spicy south american herb salsa this is what cornish pasties dream of being when they grow up my next dish uses super fine filler pastry and his variation on a moroccan classic easy chicken pastilla first chop onions ginger then fry them in hot olive oil add cinnamon and to give the mix a subtle sweet note a pinch of sugar then season chop cook chicken thighs and add to the mix pour in chicken stock and then simmer stir and hold lightly beaten eggs which thicken the sauce and cook add in sliced almonds then set aside to cool [Music] now build your pastilla filo is another pastry that's tricky to make at home but you can buy fantastic filo so cheat brush each sheet with melted butter and lay four sheets into a greased baking tin [Music] spoon in half of the fantastic aromatic chicken filling add four more butter sheets of filo pastry and simply pile in the rest of the delicious chicken finally cover with a couple of sheets of filo and fold over all the draped sides brush with more butter then bake in a hot oven for 10 to 15 minutes until the top is crispy and golden brown you want all the filler paste wonderfully crunchy and golden so turn over and return for another 10 minutes when done removed and for a different but delicious sweet finishing touch dust lightly with icing sugar and cinnamon intensely aromatic sweet and savory crispy and succulent an extraordinary pie that has to be tasted to be believed [Music] three types of pastry three mouthwatering fillings three more recipes you can stake your life on and so simple to do beautiful for easy accurate baking you need the right kit you don't need to spend a fortune on masses of kitchen equipment here's my quick guide to two essentials you need for baking scales and a sieve bacon is so popular now these scales are absolutely essential especially when you have to follow the recipe to the exact grammar these digital scales are so easy to follow they can convert from pounds and ounces to kilos and grams and more importantly so much easier to use than your mum's old weight absolutely perfect a sieve make sure you get one with a long handle and balancing hooks so you can rest it over your mixing bowl or a pan easy thing to have in the drawer costs nothing but it's so effective especially with bacon with these two pieces of kit definitely on the right road to baking like a pro [Music] welcome back to my ultimate cookery course next on my guide to better bacon i'll be teaching you how to make a stylishly simple and sumptuous cheesecake peaceful but first be it bacon or any type of cooking always pays off to use the best ingredients you can find and you're never too old to learn from the experts [Music] next my shopping guide to get the best milk and cream when it comes to knowing what makes great quality milk dairy farmer charlie ray is your man he's been producing milk from he's heard of handmade specialist breed jersey cattle for over 30 years [Music] yeah they're part of the family almost so he's up to his wellies in the stuff jersey milk is very high butter fat which therefore means it is very creamy very creamy to drink and it's the best quality milk you'll get anywhere jersey cows very docile very friendly very easy to manage and this is my favorite um she's about 17 years old she's called misty if you think of the large arctic milk tank as you see going up and down the motorways she's filled one and a half of those on her own [Music] i reckon these are happy cows they've got a dry roof over their heads they've got a dry bed and they've got as much food as they want the happier they are and the better kept they are the better the quality of the milk that comes out the other end [Music] this is what's called an abreast milking parlour one down the other way and it suits us in as much as we've got contact with the cows we can treat each cow individually the milk goes up through a meat up into that line through a big filter and into the tank well there you are without this product you wouldn't have chocolate cheese yogurts it's the base ingredient in so many things that you buy and totally take for granted and where there's milk there's also glorious cream essential for brilliant bacon and lots of savory dishes too [Music] single cream is around 18 fat so it's a lighter option for topping desserts or stirring into savory sauces whereas double cream at nearly 50 fat is lovely and rich in panna cottas or in a carbonara source as well as being able to withstand boiling whipping and freezing sour cream salad with a similar culture to that used in yogurt is a really tasty topping for chilies or baked potatoes clotted cream rich thick and a delicious indulgence served with puddings and scones or an ice cream to make it extra rich and mascarpone actually a creamy soft italian cheese famously used in italian dessert tiramisu it's also fantastic in cheesecakes [Music] it is font of all life in great bacon as with all cooking sometimes less is more the easiest dishes look and taste spectacular when they're done well and it doesn't come any simpler or more stylish than my next dish wonderful baked cheesecake for me food always has to be impressive but when it comes to desserts often you see spun sugar or wild decorations remember simple is always the most impressive this cheesecake is so straightforward yet so delicious now cream cheese leave it out the fridge for five or ten minutes go nice and soft trust me your arms will be thanking you sugar in this cheesecake is the new york cheesecake because it's baked so there's no base start creaming the cheese and the sugar spending the amount of time i do in the states if there's one thing they know how to do out there is the most amazing impressive cheesecake rich delicious but so simple work the bowl lift the ball to your advantage really whisk whisk whisk whisk lovely nice and creamy now get your eggs add the extra mixture bit by bit doing it this way it's more efficient hey you're incorporating a lot of air b the mixture doesn't separate lastly your egg lovely of course you can use electric mixer but why go to the gym we can just make a cheesecake a day a cheesecake a day keep the bingo wings away now a couple of tablespoons of flour give it a whisk stop something going lumpy now i want to scent that cheesecake i've got the freshness zest of the lemon in there i want to sort of tart it up even more fold in some fresh raspberries so just mix them through be careful to crush them then grease the cake in with butter this will ensure your cheesecake slides out beautifully get your mix let that fall in now take your cake tin and just tap it mixture hits the bottom of the cake tin the raspberries rise and you've got raspberries at the top the middle and the bottom it also stops all these little pockets of air trapping underneath the mixture in the cake tin there's no holes in the cheesecake now into the oven 180 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes [Music] slightly souffled up pull off [Music] that's the color i wanted on top and look at it it's one of the simplest yet the most stylish cheesecakes anywhere beautiful [Music] next my tricks to the trade and kitchen tips kicking off with how to handle pastry lightly flour the surface pastry on top rolling pin now the secret now is don't overwork the pastry firm push turn the pastry round and this helps to even the pastry turn and roll now as it starts to crack don't worry just by pushing it back together it sort of unites the pastry immediately apply pressure turn the pastry now the average thickness is down to a one pound coin back on to the rolling pin and look beautiful for the neatest edge on tarts and quiches my tip is to let the pastry hang over the side of the tin when you bake it trim around the edge once the pastry is cooked it will give you a cleaner edge and prevent it from shrinking [Music] my tip for even rising is to place cakes and tarts in the center of the oven so the air can circulate all the way around them to test your cake to make sure it's done insert a knife skewer or even a piece of spaghetti in the center if there's mixture stuck to it it's not done yet if it comes out clean your cake's ready [Music] if you don't have any baking beans to hand for blind baking you can use any rice grain or pulse you won't be able to cook with them afterwards but do keep them to reuse them next time when you're folding egg whites or whipped cream into cake mixtures you want to retain as much air in the mixture as you can my tip use a metal spoon as the sharp thin edge will keep more of the air in [Music] follow my ultimate cookery course

having for dinner jack come on i wouldn't do that too you know that there's more coming now because we're picking it we want to sort of make it look a little bit more attractive so we go around like that okay on an angle so when you pick all the food does it does it preserve it it's exactly what it does but also gives it a really nice salty soury flavour yeah okay now splash of water and then with the sugar nice okay so we've got to bring that up to the bowl and sort of create almost like a little syrup yeah okay little teaspoon of peppercorns in mustard seeds in quite generous on the mustard seeds that gives a bit of sort of spice now those you must know cloves excellent cloves in now touch of salt no okay so from there white wine vinegar now in order for all that to actually pickle you need to boil it so by boiling it okay it brings all the ingredients together it fuses all the spices and helps cook the celery have a little taste nice nice see i put some house on your chest yes it will look boom it's working already now see nice vinegar right celery's ready yep okay let's walk to the ball now turn that off now from there start placing the celery into that jar so

do you know what as soon as it's cooled down you can definitely eat that straight away i can't wait to dig into it at dinner aren't they delicious yes we'll leave that to cool down our pickles are ready and cooling now to marinate the chicken on the fried chicken traditionally it's always gonna be done with the dark meat the brown meat so you've got that nice sort of uh drum here and this bit that thigh cooking on the bone as well keeps it even more moist so first things first salt pepper please from there famous buttermilk buttermilk in it's brilliant for marinating the chicken if you can put this buttermilk over your chicken the night before the more it tenderizes the chicken and starts to sort of really relax the chicken and puts a really nice sort of creamy soury flavour in there so might stick that in the fridge for us please and we'll start the dolce de leche biscuits nice the argentinians call these shortbreads alfa jorge and they're the favorite sweet treat on the streets of buenos aires they're light crumbly shortbread biscuits sandwiched with gloriously golden caramelly dolce de leche sauce for the shortbread beat together softened butter granulated sugar and beat until

floured hands roll into small balls flatten into discs and place on a baking tray [Music] chill for 10 minutes until firm to touch then simply bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until pale golden once cooled sandwich two biscuits together with a camry dolce de leche sauce [Music] finish with a dusting of icing sugar [Music] delicious my dessert and pickles are ready the buttermilk should have worked its magic on the chicken all that's left is to fry it now we're gonna roll the chicken out of the buttermilk into the flour so that's why it gets nice and crispy and blistery on the outside okay cool so what we've got to make sure because the flour is the last coat yes this is nicely seasoned yeah okay so salt and pepper in there nice and this is smoked paprika so that gives it a little bit of sort of uh making yeah yeah spice that's right a little bit of heat and this one my favorites what's that cayenne pepper that's right again slightly spicy but the heat works brilliantly well garlic powder traditionally are used a lot in the steaks onion powder garlic powder just run your fingers through that please cool i'm gonna get the pan on now two centimetres of oil this is a really good mix for fish as well gushons biting a nice spicy texture helps fish so first thing is we just shake off some of the buttermilk lay that down yes okay really important to get them covered

smells of delicious food that all centered around an asian staple noodles learn to cook those properly and you'll be surprised how quick and easy it is to knock off a delicious dinner first off we're gonna soak our noodles now these are rice noodles into a bowl and just pour the hot water over the rice noodles soak and rehydrate 12 to 15 minutes to soften up if you've got a wok perfect if not just a normal size frying pan with big sloping sides pan on get it really nice and hot chicken breast very lean hardly any fat on there you've got this little fillet just slice that off now the secret to getting it really nice and thin and to cut it into strips take your knife keep it nice and flat on the board and sort of slice it in half like a sort of scallop like that we call this butterfly in the chicken take a rolling pin and nice and gently roll over the chicken what it does it sort of flattens it allows you to slice it even thinner and the thinner the slices of the chicken the sort of crispier it gets the quicker it cooks slice it in half just start slicing these nice thin slices and the good news is one chicken breast can serve two or three easily next wash your knife and finally slice garlic the thinner the garlic the crispier this is a young tender broccoli just slice them down i want a bite to the broccoli and normally you sort of paste the dish with one-third noodles one-third vegetables and one-third of your protein chicken with a dish that takes literally minutes to put together it's really important to get everything organized everything needs to be at your fingertips touch of olive oil get a pan really nice and ready just starting to smoke drop the chicken in first salt pepper open up those little strands of chicken nice once you've started to sear off

chicken thin strips because it colors and cooks at the same time as well really really crucial now that garlic's getting really nice and crispy broccoli in feels strange putting raw broccoli in like

join the chicken for your favorite real fast food dishes open up the legs and just pierce the skin there careful not to cut into the breast and hand on top of the breast and pull the drum back pop out and then slice the knife straight across there's the thigh there's the drum get your thumb and feel the joint and with the weight of the knife just slices through now two beautiful thighs now a bit of a chef's tip halfway down the drum just slice through onto the bone and then from there scrape the tendons and then hand down nice and firm on top now i'll get this beautiful bone presentation as it cooks it cooks evenly now pull out the wing feel where the end of the joint is and just slice in there through a beautiful big whole delicious wing now this is the rolls-royce part two breasts that's the breast bone there place the chicken on the board and then just slice down on the back of the crown everyone always cuts around just tilt it upwards straight through that way we get straight to the center of the carcass and therefore there's no waste and look we end up taking off his plump chicken breasts nice two drums two thighs two wings two breasts of chicken and one amazing carcass for a stock and not an ounce of waste a great tip to stop your skewers burning when you're making kebabs is to soak them in water first or for skewers with added flavor strip your rosemary branches of their leaves and use instead [Music] for no fuss marinading my tip is to place fish or meat in a plastic storage bag while they marinate it's easy to store and there's less cleanup lime juice or lemon juice make great marinades my tip for getting maximum amount of juice from a lemon or lime is to roll it hard under your palm for a minute before juicing lemons are also useful for rice add a couple of drops of juice while you cook it to keep your grains looking nice white and bright this is my ultimate cookery course 100 recipes to stake your life on i'll be showing you how to make mouth-watering burgers with a difference pork is perfect for a slider but i want a little bite in there but first my guide to getting the best ingredients for your money whether i'm knocking out fast food or planning a feast i want my dishes to be the tastiest they can be and to do that i always start with the best ingredients i can get my shopping manta is very simple knowledge is crucial the more you know personally about where your ingredients are from and how they produce the better so ask lots of questions and learn [Applause] here's a quick rundown of the six most useful vinegars and what you can do with them all my great fast and easy dressings with the exception of malt vinegar use this for pickling or splashing on your fish and chips tangy red wine vinegar is great for marinades red meats and card liver white wine vinegar is good for sweet and sour recipes as well as butter sauces cherry vinegar nutty and virgin on the sweet side this perfect splash into gazpacho or team with sweet seasoned veg like asparagus or artichokes while cider vinegar tart and fruity is ideal for pickling fruit and for vegetable chutneys rice vinegar is an essential for chinese and japanese dishes and is lovely and mild in flavor balsamic vinegar widely considered as the king of vinegars is the one i use time and time again dark and syrupy its sweet and sharp taste is a great addition if you're frying juicy steaks or chops in marinades or on fresh sweet strawberries like fine wine the price reflects the time it's been matured anywhere between three and 25 years look out for the stamp to make sure you're getting the genuine article from italy's modern region you can pay up to 200 quid for just 100 mils of top quality balsamic vinegar like this one and if you do splash out on one of the fine types you'll have to taste it to believe it [Music] there's a wealth of classic fast food dishes we know and love from hot dogs and kebabs to tacos and burgers but the great thing about making them at home is you can throw away the rule book and get creative my next easy recipe is a miniature version of an american favorite the burger smoky pork sliders with barbecue sauce everyone loves a burger they're a true fast food original and that's the exciting thing about street food you can take an old classic like that and reinvent it into something really exciting when you think of a burger what you need is a great sauce an unlike smoky barbecue it goes hand in glove with a great burger start by finely chopping one onion and three cloves of garlic nice hot pan tablespoon of olive oil onions and garlic into the pan nice seasoning salt and pepper now the secret of a good barbecue sauce is that really important caramelization to begin with a nice tablespoon of brown sugar it darkens the onions but it really starts to sort of give that nice syrupy body to the sauce i'll put a little bit of heat in there now a nice teaspoon of smoked paprika that's the important part of working with spices you've got to cook them out and almost sort of burn off that rawness especially with a smoked paprika that's exactly where i want it to go onions and garlic beautifully caramelized cider vinegar in reduce that down now i've got a fantastic smoky base to complete the sauce i'm making my life really easy and adding pre-made worcester sauce and tomato ketchup cook that out for two to three minutes now depending on how thick you like the barbecue sauce that determines how long you cook it out for i don't want it to be too runny but i don't want it too thick either that's the consistency we're looking for lovely turn down the gas charger seasoning now take that out it's the kind of sauce that i like to have sort of bottled up in the fridge it's great for sandwiches but goes brilliantly well with these sliders homemade smoky barbecue sauce [Music] give the pan a little wipe now start the mix for the sliders to give my mix a really interesting flavor and texture i'm gonna be using unsmoked back bacon i travel all over the world and i spend a lot of time in the states they know how to make a great slider pork sliders beef sliders chicken sliders and it's almost like a way of having a burger but on a much smaller miniature level a little teaspoon of olive oil i want that bacon to get really nice and crispy bacon in this just gives the really nice sort of chunky delicious mix i want texture and pork is perfect for a slider [Music] and choppy shallots slots are a lot sweeter than your normal white onion fine fine fine and in [Music] now that bacon's getting really nice and crispy i want a bit of heat in there a little teaspoon of smoked paprika in there when you see these sliders in the states for one portion there's like four or five of them little mini one biters incredible now take your pork just open up and give that a really nice seasoning so important you can't season a slider after you've cooked it it's impossible so season it nicely bacon now that's nice and crispy just take a little touch kitchen roll and just drain that off there nice pat that nice and dry i want all that nice sort of crispiness in there beautiful mix all that in take a nice ball and sort of roll it size of a golf ball get it nice and round first and then three fingers just pat that down don't flatten them too thin otherwise they overcook and they go sort of dry because sliders are bite-sized burgers designed to go in small buns you don't want to make them too big good get the pan nice and hot a tablespoon of olive oil when a slider is literally that thick about an inch thick we're going to take two and a half to three minutes to each side in turn them over lovely once you've turned them tilt the pan and just spoon all that juice back into them keep my mouth watering now very easy to dry the pork out so just feeling it now with your fingers is nice and firm it's a little touch of springiness in the center i'm happy with those add your cheese now so it gets nicely melted i'm using wedgies of smoked cheddar and it has that nice sort of soury smoky creaminess to the slider finally shredded baby gem lettuce just take those buns make sure they're sliced nice and evenly take your lettuce be quite generous with the lettuce just a nice thin slice of tomato take your burgers you see that cheese if you've melted your barbecue sauce place the top on and that is my version of a slider that is small dynamic but packed full of flavor i'll take that over a hamburger any day follow my ultimate cookery course crammed with key

details go on get cooking welcome to my ultimate cookery course packed with quick cooking tips know-how and 100 recipes to take your life on right this is my guide to amazing home cooked street food classics [Music] street food gets its name because it's cooked and eaten on the streets from the hawker marcus in asia to the new york hot dog stands there are some great chefs out there serving seriously delicious food that you can eat on the go my first recipe is a special mix of fantastic flavors from around the world beef tacos with wasabi mayo the great thing about street food is anything goes the only rule is they've got to be really fast and really tasty now these tacos mix are mexican and japanese flavors into a delicious meaty mouthful first off get that pan really nice and hot these are sirloin steaks sear it in the pan with all that fat on i'll add flavor salt and pepper couple tablespoons of olive oil in pan nice and hot hold up the steak and lay it in always lay away give the pan a little shake and it stops the steak from sticking we're looking for color and if it sticks it's gonna burn [Music] while the steaks are cooking i can get on with my super quick marinade now two tablespoons of misood paste that's a fermented soybean that gives a really nice sort of rich sweetness tablespoon of sugar a couple of tablespoons rice wine that gives it a really nice vinegary kick a couple of tablespoons of olive oil salt and pepper i'm looking for a nice sort of thick rich marinade marinade done it's time to turn the steaks sort the pan and to give the steaks a little base all we're doing every time is just adding more and more flavor take your tongs and sort of lift the steak on its back and really melt all that fat down offer the gas take them out just take your knife see all that fat there just slice that off i don't want any of that now in to the marinade [Music] beautiful tacos are one of mexico's most popular street foods they've been made from beef pork chicken or fish and are loaded up with amazing sauces and spices now i want something sort of pickly cabbage these are um chinese cabbages slice it in half look at it really crisp and really tasty we're gonna slice that into quarters and then just shred it and take your time you think of cabbage here and you think of sort of braised overcooked cabbage nothing worse but at a taco you want freshness a little season of chili flakes they sort of discreetly give it a little bit of heat a little touch of rice wine vinegar if you haven't got that fresh lemon juice a small drop of toasted sesame seed oil give that a really good mix now i need something to sort of bring it together we take some wasabi paste very hot very spicy a sort of thumbnail size i'm gonna mix that with a couple of tablespoons of mayonnaise and give that a really good mix these are basic corn tortilla the trick is to sort of color them and then shape them actually place it on the gas ring use some tongs so it's not to burn yourself you can also toast your tacos in a frying pan from there i'm just gonna place it on the rolling pin literally 30 seconds as it cools down the great thing about serving tacos is people can fill them themselves just the way they want them cabbage just squeeze out wet marinade a nice rustic little mountain mayonnaise on wait you see how soft and delicious and almost sort of melting in the mouth texture we've got on this amazing sirloin it's look at that really nice sear around the outside it's just nice and pink in the middle start off with my crispy shell back of the spoon with the wasabi mayonnaise inside taco and just sprinkle that delicious pickled cabbage and then just start lining my tacker with three or four slices touch more on my spicy layer that is how i'd make the perfect taco [Music] when you want comfort food quick fast food classics always deliver here are three more of my street food favorites all super easy but still put the

[Music] you don't need to spend a fortune on masses of kitchen equipment here's my quick guide to another cooking essential frying pan for me one of my favorites why because it's so versatile whether you're searing the most amazing rack of lamb cooking duck breasts sauteing chicken or even a quick omelet or even find an egg all in one look for an oven-proof frying pan with a metal handle if you want to cook like pros by finishing off your dish in the oven or under a hot grill just don't forget when you take it out the handle will be hot if you can get a high quality non-stick one with a thick heavy base which will distribute the heat evenly brilliant welcome back to my ultimate cookery course next on my guide to street food i'll be whipping up an indulgent finger-licking treat that is amazing but first like any passionate chef i want the best ingredients i can find whether it's for savory or sweet dishes next up my guide to buying chocolate chocolate gives you such an instant hit it's well worth knowing about the good stuff and who better to ask than award-winning alchemist of the sweetest kind paul young even when i don't want to think about it i'm thinking about it his cutting-edge approach to chocolate making has won him accolades around the world so when you're not shopping the best way is to look at your chocolate bar look on the back and look at the percentage that gives you how much cocoa is in the bar and the more cocoa the more rich intoxicating flavor so the most exciting bit is tasting chocolate good quality fine chocolate should have that clean snap bite a piece off and crunch it in your teeth but stop chewing let it melt move it around the mouth and you'll find that by letting it melt even dark chocolate that you've had before that seems quite bitter won't be when you chew quickly it releases tannin it releases all the bitterness in the chocolate letting it melt it's smoother and richer and you get all the flavor and most excitingly is it releases something into the brain called dopamine which makes you feel good and that's how you get addicted to real chocolate chocolate is not just an addictive treat it's an amazing ingredient here's my take on which kind to use for what [Music] white chocolate with its sweet vanilla taste is perfect used as a dipping or pouring sauce with fresh fruit or frozen berries for a quick dessert creamy milk chocolate is great for family friendly puddings and treats like quick bake cakes or melt onto homemade crepes or waffles dark chocolate is rich and intense i like using 70 coco stuff use it for ice creams that really pack a punch 100 pure cocoa has a very powerful intense taste and only the real chocolate geeks eat it straight and remember chocolate isn't just for sweet dishes for the famous mexican molay sauce this is the one to grab is there anything better than chocolate they say sex but that's totally overrated chocolate is a key ingredient in my favorite sweet fast food dishes which at their best are always irresistible instant and utterly satisfying so when you want an indulgent chocolate hit my next recipe will be right up your alley malt chocolate donuts street food is all about satisfying your cravings these donuts are sweet sticky and absolutely delicious first off we're gonna make the dough now this dough takes a bit of time but it's really exciting i'm heating all of the milk with the sugar this yeast easy to get hold of now when you make fresh donuts you need fresh yeast adding some of the warm milk to the yeast will activate it which will help the dough to rise just half give that a quick whisk the sugar sugar's dissolved in the milk the fresh yeast disintegrates instantly set the yeast mixture to one side while it does its job to start the main dough mix i'm adding half the butter to the remaining milk that gives the dough a nice silkiness i want it light so melt the butter into the milk flour into a sieve that helps to make the dough nice and smooth and you know when you've got a smooth dough it sort of rises evenly add a pinch of salt and two egg yolks pour in the warm milk and melted butter don't start over mixing it when you over mix the dough of a doughnut it gets really tight you're not gonna let it ariel yeast in nice and warm i love that smell now i'm looking for a sort of elasticy texture just dropping off the spoon nice flour the board take the dough out lovely lightly sprinkle touch more flour and just pull it over and push in every time you're sort of turning it almost like you're turning the dough into itself the dough should just sort of relax it shouldn't be sticking to your fingers now it's just nice and pliable set that in a nice clean bowl a little sprinkling flour in there so as it starts to rise it doesn't stick cover that with some film leave the dough to rise in a warm place for 60 to 90 minutes until it's doubled in size this stage is called proving now whilst that's proving get a panel for the chocolate filling or ganache pour 500 mils of double cream into a saucepan and add honey [Music] bring the mixture to a gentle boil [Music] traditionally we always put jam in there but chocolate and donuts wow to die for add the cream i'll give that a good mix the butter elevates the ganache into a really nice shiny chocolate coat look at that whoa give it a really nice whisk the whistling gives it that aerated texture to the ganache you're just lightening the load a little bit nice chocolate filling done put it in the fridge to cool then it's time to gently roll out the dough just let it roll naturally about a centimetre and a half in depth slice one two place them on to your tray and let them rise again once the donors have had 30 to 40 minutes to rise it's time to shallow fry them in a pan filled one third full with hot vegetable oil risen but look they're sort of like little pockets of air right here we go place these in nice and carefully four maximum if there's too many in the pan the oil will go cold and the donuts will come out soggy turn them over beautiful [Music] they're gonna come out into some sugar mixed with some malt powder 50 50. how do you tell they're actually cooked in the center tap on top should be hollow in and just sprinkle the malt and the sugar shake off the excess i get so excited every time i make donuts now look at those beauties these are delicious eating as they are but the ganache is gonna be the icing on the cake piping bag peel the bag over your hand don't forget to pop the nozzle in i want the texture almost like a little liquid inside so i'm going gonna pipe them on a little bit warm hopefully with that burst of magic operation donut lift up the donut squeeze push in and fill just to start seeing that chocolate coming out and sit that back down nice sit them on there they've got a little bit heavier and we all know why nice that one's got my name on it that is amazing [Music] next my tricks of the trade and kitchen tips starting with how to do your steak the way you want it i want to cook my steak rare so by touching the steak i want the same feedback as it is on the inside of my thumb that's rare as it starts to cook it gets a lot firmer medium is there semi-firm with a slight resistance well done it's there rare a great tip for getting meat or fish to cook faster is to score it which allows the heat to penetrate quicker this also allows marinades to be absorbed more deeply for stain free tupperware coat it thinly with oil which acts as a barrier between plastic and food it's so easy to make your own chili sherry to use in quick stir-fries or sauces take 450 ml of dry sherry such as fino and using a funnel pour into a sterilised bottle add five whole thai chilies seal with a cork or lid and leave to infuse for a couple of weeks my tip for using any discarded chili seeds is plant them to grow yourself some new chili peppers plant in an egg shell or seedling trays start them indoors and move

you i don't like coming second best okay next year i'm coming back oh yes number one thank you papaya and chicken that sounds interesting now doesn't it yeah and i mean okay i didn't win fine but what i did come here for was to pick up some knowledge to see how i can put that in to the streets of calcutta thank you ladies thank you russian dean good bye how are you good to see you excellent and this is annie's sagu zagat are you sure they're not bonking off school no no no definitely he's not i didn't adopt him okay right first thing i need um the fire lighting i'm going to draw on the unique flavors of the northeast to create three delicious curries my first is chicken and green papaya inspired by the winning recipe at the cooking competition it will have that classic asami sour tang that the locals won't be used to green papaya helps it not just soften the chicken but marinate it also gives that really nice tart flavor i'm going to make a fish curry using the dried bamboo shoot from nagaland it's something of an acquired taste and i don't know how it'll go down here it's a combination of a sort of bay leaf stroke lemongrass with a little hint of licorice first time for you i'm so pleased my final dish is a north eastern take on vegetable curry instead of using dried spices i'm using fresh ones making a more subtle flavor finish with a puree of sesame seed almost thickened vegetable curry with a sesame seed paste and then after that the fresh coriander paste just one last thing to do before i open my stall i am sweating like a pig i look like a pig i stink like a pig right i'm gonna get changed right cooler much better so it's not exactly chef whites is it but i suppose it's uh it's equivalent my local chef wise to tell you why it's a lot cooler huh nothing wrong with going commander in the midday sun time to see if my take on the northeast curries can win over calcutta's foodies [Music] you must stress that it's from the north east yeah you must tell them that that's nice tell me how i say okay let's go fish curry certainly sir actually this is a new thing to us in calcutta i don't know other people will like it or not but in my opinion it's really a super bonus let's go let's go let's go the food is very good and uh i have the face with bamboo shoots it's very tasty bamboo with green papaya thank you let's go chicken papaya has gone down a storm extraordinary it was really good i've never tasted a bamboo and the vegetables and these are really good last chicken lovely that is unbelievable that's barely 50 minutes over 100 portions of chicken's gone which is fantastic news with the last of the chicken papaya gone my fish and vegetable curries quickly sell out too so thank you that is now officially gordon ramsay's calcutta cafe closed finished it's been a great day i've enjoyed myself and judging by the reaction my career has been a success 500 600 700 800 900 1000 2000. that my son is a good morning's work okay yes thanks every people say the food is excellent today definitely everybody said that but there's one person's opinion that really matters food writer non don's arrived to give me his verdict hi gordon how are you doing brother how are you i'm good how was your week uh my week has been amazing so what did you cook up today so today we did a um a take on a chicken with green papaya we did an amazing fish carry i saved you a little portion because i was getting slightly worried [Music] no wonder you sold out thank you believe me you happy with that not only that you have actually succeeded in doing something many people would have said is impossible well done that's very kind of very well done very well done i look ridiculous i must have lost half my body weight in sweat but i've proved that curries of the northeast of india are worth shouting about i thought my first week in india was a eye-opener this one was a shock i think because it's hard to believe that exists it's almost like you weren't in india the culture is equally as exciting as the food just an amazing eye opener the simplicity the concentration of great ingredients and not pissing around with it india's helped me to become you know not just you know a proper chef i've never i was never out that bracket but it it's helped me to confirm what i love doing more than anything can we top that i doubt it but i can't

incredibly delicious and really straightforward to do now season the water just a little touch of olive oil stops it from becoming too sticky i love polenta it's a cool meal made from ground dried maize the more coarse the longer it takes to cook but you can also buy instant polenta which is ready in under 10 minutes and always use this at home and then whisk that out as it cooks out it naturally thickens you see the grains becoming almost into one nice fine pureed polenta to take the polenta to another level flavor-wise season with salt and pepper a good knob of butter and parmesan quite generous with the parmesan because polenta can be quite dull i like it quite rich and creamy delicious now mix that in a nice smooth shiny glossy planter you can eat polenta two ways like this it's a glorious fluffy mash or set then griddled which is what i'm doing start by oiling a baking tray pour in your polenta now get that in the fridge and let it set next i'm roasting fine tomatoes to really intensify their flavor olive oil on the bottom of the tray and drizzle extra virgin olive oil on top nip your tomatoes with your scissors if you didn't burst them before they went in the oven they'd explode salt and pepper garlic just squeeze the juice out the garlic so as the tomatoes blister and roast it's going to take on all this lovely garlic to give the tomatoes a wonderful sweet and sour flavor a pinch of sugar and balsamic vinegar this is a wonderful aged balsamic vinegar and then some thyme don't pick the time just trim it like you're having a little haircut nice the tomatoes only take 10 minutes to roast now the plant is set it's ready to griddle it should just fall out beautiful plenty of nice garnish for grilled meats it's great when you're planning a big dinner party the polenta can be done one or two days before a nice season top and bottom a nice sort of coating of olive oil and then onto your grill now this looks very impressive but it's so easy to do get that grill really nice and hot make sure you've got a fish slice and go underneath to turn all that nice sort of marking and char in the blender gives that really nice flavor now tomatoes look you got these beautiful vine tomatoes that have been roasted and all that wonderful flavor [Music] now get your little tomatoes and just sit them on top drizzle over any remaining roasting juices the perfect addition is a goat's curd goat's curd gives it that nice sort of salty creamy taste goat's cheese cream cheese or creme fraiche will work just as well drizzle a little touch of that aged barcelona vinegar and then a little basil i can't wait to dive in this dish is fantastic when entertaining in the morning set your planter the night before and you can have this casual brunch on the table within minutes fuss-free cooking that looks like a labor of love first and my incredibly easy fragrant crispy filo delicious with a simple honey yogurt now these are beautiful fila pastry sheets now it is possible to make it but to be honest to try and stretch the pastry that thin and get it even it's an absolute nightmare life's too short to make it at home when you can buy amazing filo pastry so when working with it always get a nice damp cloth and just lay the damp cloth over it that keeps it nice and moist and it stops the filler pastry from actually drying out put a pan on to melt your butter it's the butter that gives the crispiness to the filo pastry if you're going to brush or coat filler pastry with butter and make sure that butter is nicely seasoned you take your first layer lay it onto the board nice brush that with your butter and the nice thing about filler pastry is that it can be used for savory and sweet these are going to have a fragrant savoury flavor with thyme black pepper and parmesan cheese so no need for salt lift up the corner and fold very quickly brush the ends and just nip those ends together non-stick pan on a little splash of olive oil fry the pastry for one to two minutes on each side so you want them to sort of puff up the secrets get them quickly you can smell that cheese in that time you're looking for them to become golden and crispy simple as that and then out smells delicious and as they sit and cool down instantly they become really nice and crispy the filler goes fantastically well with thick creamy greek yogurt and a drizzle of runny honey there's something quite sort of middle eastern about the herbs the yogurt and the honey and the sort of crispy textures of the filo pastry an alternative savory breakfast when you want a stunning and sophisticated breakfast that mixes fragrant herbs and cheese with glorious honey yogurt this middle eastern treat hits the spot and it's so simple to make we're creating bbq style beef

through his favourite stress-free recipes, including Sticky pork ribs, Moroccan lamb with sweet potato & raisins, Spicy chutney, Meatballs in fragrant coconut broth AND...",2022-11-30 22:16:02.926159, [Music] welcome to my ultimate cookery course packed with cooking tips information and 100 recipes to stake your life on right now it's all about making it easy [Music] making it easy for yourself in the kitchen means using the time you have effectively and the one thing that can really help you do that is your freezer [Music] my recipe for meatballs is so versatile it can be used to make a dozen amazing dishes one of my favorites is meatballs in fragrant coconut broth having a freezer of home-cooked delicious food ready to go can be a real life saver it means you never have to compromise on flavor these meatballs are delicious but more importantly they freeze so well first off get your pan on and start sweating off your onions and your garlic this recipe involves making the meatballs in a classic way but the exciting part is actually cook them in coconut milk and it gives a really nice new dimension to a sort of soft rich sumptuous meatball chop the onion nice and finely keeping those slices very close together close closer the slices the finer the onions pat it back down at an angle slice down and just chop i want the onions nice and fine because i want some finesse to these meatballs and the secret of a really good meatball is the texture getting that balance right between the minced beef the breadcrumbs the milk and the seasoning a couple cloves of garlic slice the garlic really nice and thinly nice pan nice and hot a tablespoon of olive oil quite generous with the olive oil onions and garlic in a touch of salt and pepper with your mince open it up a little bit and sort of pat it out salt and pepper for me a good meatball is all about the softness the texture of that rich beef and the way it sort of melts in your mouth you can color it on the outside but you want it nice and soft and sort of rich in the center mix that in beautifully and then paste it back out again i've got some really nice dried chili flakes i'm gonna season the onions with the chili flakes chili flakes in cook that out for two minutes i'm gonna add some milk [Music] take your bread crumbs make a little well three four tablespoons of milk that makes a sort of nice slightly doughy texture but it lightens the texture of the meatball place that in add your onions your garlic and your chilli in there as well nice put your hands in there and start mixing them if you've got the right amount of milk and breadcrumbs it doesn't mean binding with an egg don't make them too small the problem with making them too small is the fact that they dry out quickly just the size of a golf ball a little bit bigger nice really nice tight squeeze that stops it from breaking up it always pays to double the recipe and spend a bit more time making extra meatballs so you can freeze a batch ready for another time give the pan a little wipe out don't wash out that pan we've got that flavour from the onions and the garlic at the bottom get that pan nice and hot a touch of olive oil in there place them at the top of your pan nice and gently sit them in the oil get a pallet knife and go underneath them and just sort of tilt the pan and let the pan cook the back of the meatball we're going to add some heat coanda seeds slightly spicy and peppery just to give a really nice flavor to the coconut milk in next some cardamom seeds three or four onto the board knife on in a little touch of turmeric into the center of the pan that's going to give it a really nice spicy flavor a little pinch cinnamon all the time you're doing this those meatballs are just getting tastier and tastier a couple of dried chilies let them infuse in that oil and then some lemongrass just take the back of your knife and sort of beat it down that starts to release all that lovely sort of fragrance like someone's just let off the most amazing fragrant air freshener in the lemongrass and finally some fresh ginger just peel and slice nice and thinly time now to turn them over and let the other half a wonderful flavor chicken stock in bring the stock up to the boil turn the gas up and then add the coconut milk i want the coconut milk just sitting underneath the top of the meatball coconut milk in and that sort of gives it that creamy richness but it's not heavy it's a fragrant light richness before we start simmering check the seasoning that nice soft texture of the meatball but that fragrance light richness of the coconut broth just gonna cook those meatballs perfectly bring the broth up to the boil then simmer gently for eight to ten minutes touch them with your finger this should be slightly pliable but slightly springy gas off i'm gonna finish it off with something light and fresh zest of lime but i want the zest on top of the meatball so i'll cut through that richness and then finally squeeze the fresh lime and that just gives it that nice zesty amazing taste stir in the juice [Music] i've got that kick and that vibrant taste the exciting part when you come to serve it be generous with that coconut broth tilt the pan get a good couple of ladles of the broth in meatballs [Music] and that is a very delicious way of eating a old-fashioned meatball and bringing it into the 21st century and they're just as good cooked from frozen as well [Music] the secret to stress-free cooking is making it easy for yourself here are three more recipes all based on my delicious freezer friendly meatballs just defrost them before you get started first up beef meatballs with ariketti kale and pine nuts [Music] add meatballs to hot oil and brown meanwhile cook educated pasta then add chopped garlic to the meatballs and shredded kale a delicious green veg packed with vitamins which cooks in minutes cabbage is a great alternative if you can't get kale put in some of the cooking water from the pasta to steam when the pasta is cooked al dente drain and add to the meatballs season then finish with sweet buttery pine nuts and grated fresh parmesan cheese meatballs with oliketti kale and pine nuts from meatballs to meal in minutes my next easy standby supper is beef meatball sandwich with melting mozzarella and tomato salsa [Music] top a lightly toasted roll with pan-fried meatballs then tear off chunks of creamy buffalo mozzarella pile it on and melt it under the grill for the tangy salsa slice sweet red onion then add juicy diced tomatoes and roughly chop fresh coriander season and drizzle with olive oil spoon over [Music] perfect in a flash beef meatball sandwich with melting mozzarella and a tomato salsa a sandwich to die for my final super easy meatball recipe is fiery meatball soup [Music] fried chopped onion and finely sliced garlic in hot olive oil add cumin seeds for warmth and add your meatballs cook on a high heat to get all those aromatic flavors out once the meatballs are browned add hot chili paste for a spicy kick tinned tomatoes dried oregano and a litre of beef stock [Music] then simmer [Music] next add sweet corn and chop courgettes [Music] to finish add hot jalapeno peppers chopped fresh coriander and crushed tortilla chips a one-pot meatball wonder that really packs a punch fiery meatball soup [Music] one versatile meatball recipe four deliciously different dishes food that's certain to make your life in the kitchen easier and stress-free amazing whether you're making great food to freeze or to take straight to the table you need to know how to shop for the best ingredients next up my shopping guide to oils it doesn't matter if you're baking frying or dressing salads using the right oil can dramatically alter the taste and texture here are the most common oils and what to use them for [Music] sunflower oil is a good value all-rounder nice and light for frying baking in dressings and spicy dishes groundnuts or peanut oil is great for cooking on high heat as it gets really hot without burning sesame oil a flavoursome sweet and nutty oil perfect sprinkled over asian dishes before serving rapeseed oil is a healthier choice for using in salads i love walnut oil fantastically fragrant it's brilliant for salad dressings and it gives cakes a distinctive flavor but the oil i use most in my cooking is olive oil [Music] to find some of the best olive oils sold in britain you have to go to one of the most unlikely places an electrical shop in london's east end [Music] turkish born mehmet morat has olive all in his blood my family's produced this olive oil for centuries what he doesn't know about it isn't worth knowing the very best extra virgin olive oil is first cold pressed it's actually pressed by stone and then it's put through a centrifugal spinner which spins out all the bitter waters and then you've got pure olive oil cold pressed olive oil and you've got to taste it to believe it pour a little sample slurp it draw it in without don't swallow it warm it in your mouth coat the whole of the inside of your mouth with it and then swallow it'll go down like fruit juice and it will leave no greasiness or oiliness in your mouth whatsoever absolutely sensational beautiful my favorite use of any olive oils is to pour it into a bowl room temperature rub some wild oregano into it and get some fresh crusty bread and just dip it it's food on its own don't need anything else welcome back to my ultimate cookery course next on my guide to making it easy i'll be creating a sweet treat to drool over i want the chocolate my little matchsticks dotted around but first my quick guide to the basic kit you need to get cooking fantastic food you don't need to spend a fortune on masses of kitchen equipment here are three more kitchen essentials [Music] whisk spoon and spatula these three items are so cheap yet they are so important to great home cooking a whisk there's so much more control when you've got something whisking in your hand you can gauge it so much better than you can if it's an electric mixer the bigger the balloon on your hand whisk the faster it'll whip as it draws in more air wooden spoons don't scratch pans and should be washed by hand spatulas are indispensable for baking or mixing make sure it's heat resistant so it doesn't melt but more importantly phenomenal for making omelettes great with scrambled eggs and you waste nothing because the spatula almost cleans the bowl instantly with these three you'll be well on your way to cooking like a pro and you'll need all three for my next recipe [Music] my take on classic chocolate brownies is guaranteed but a smart on anyone's face and not just when they're fresh out of the oven blondies stock up in these delicious blondies they'll keep for up to a week and it's a great way of getting ahead of your expecting guest round first off melt the butter for the mixture we've had hundreds and hundreds of brownies the sort of white chocolate version i.e blondies are amazing a little bit more subtle keep a little knob of butter for the end just to grease your baking tray turn the gas down and gently melt that butter caster sugar into the bowl [Music] just give that butter a little whisk sort of makes the mixture a little bit lighter slightly fluffy off with the gas a pinch of salt in the sugar then make a little well in the middle and sort of whisk you can see it's already gone nice and blonde love it give that a really good mix and the secret with the butter be slightly warm sort of it melts the sugar nice and smooth lovely a teaspoon of vanilla extract in next lightly whisk in two whole eggs just give them a little beat this is such a delicious recipe yet so simple whisk in the eggs looking for that nice sort of rich textured smooth paste you can see why we call these blondies beautiful next teaspoon of baking powder baking powder in then half a teaspoon of baking soda that aerates the mixture and gives it that little tartness you'll see this sort of rise instantly the minute they hit the oven and then your flour whisk with one hand and just slowly add half the flour first get that all mixed up make sure that mixture is really nice and smooth check it occasionally no lumps half flour in and then the other half in you'll feel it sort of almost nice and firm and that's why it's so important to add the flour in stages it stops the mixture going lumpy it should be just dropping off the whisk beautiful change over from a whisk to a spoon next i want some texture some nice sweet chewiness to the blondies dried cranberries they bake beautifully but it gives the blondie a really nice sort of chewy sweetness in the center next a white chocolate i'm not gonna grate it i'm gonna chop it up just slice it like little bits of shrapnel i want the chocolate like little matchsticks dotted around now chocolate in lovely fold that in i want a nice even distribution of those wonderful dried cranberries don't over mix it i want to break up that chocolate nice even mix of cranberries and chocolate you can see the chocolate there'll be parts of the chocolate in the oven that will actually melt there'll be like little pools of white melted chocolate in the center now a baking tray small little knob of butter and the grease baking tray and line it some greaseproof paper and just over extend it shiny side out dull side hits the bottom of the tray in greaseproof allows me to maximize on the white chocolate inside the mix no greaseproof paper the chocolate can melt and almost stick to the tray so the paper is just a really nice insurance policy secondly we want that rise and that sort of crispness now with the mix get your spatula all the way around i don't want to see anything left in that bowl position the bowl over your tray nice and carefully loudly don't leave that slice in the bowl nobody's licking that one and then just take the back of the spatula go into the corners push and come back into the middle turn the tray around let it work to your advantage try and get it evenly positioned in the tray if it goes in even it cooks evenly make sure you smooth out the top of the blondie with the back of the spatula and then into the oven it's going to rise nice and crisp all that soft gooeyness in the center bake your blondies at 180 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes that smells incredible it's got that crisp edge on the outside in that sort of soft gooey center leave that to cool down and it's going to sort of firm up and wrinkle but it'll stay nice and gooey in the center once it's cooled down take it out and start slicing [Music] mouth-watering blonde is a fantastic easy treat to have on hand for yourself or to share [Music] next my tricks of the trade and kitchen tips to make your life easier make sure you make the most of your freezer my tip for amazing tuna capacio is to freeze it first and it will slice beautifully it's wise to save leftover wine for cooking my tip is to freeze the remaining wine in freezer bags or ice cube trays it's great in stocks and sauces [Music] when you freeze suits or stews in tubs the tip is not to overfill them leave room to expand in the container a great tip for a cheap homemade ice cream buy a high quality vanilla ice cream and make it your own by mixing in berries chocolate or my favorite rum and boozy raisins [Music] a fantastic tip for leftover lemons and limes is to cut them into wedges freeze and use them like ice cubes they won't water down your drink and they'll also add flavor [Music] follow my ultimate cookery course crammed with key lessons top tips 100 recipes to stay your life on and you'll literally be cooking yourself into a better chef many of these amazing recipes are on my app please check out the app store for details go on get cooking welcome to my ultimate cookery course packed with cooking tips information and 100 recipes to stake your life on right now it's all about stress-free cooking cooking dishes in advance is a brilliant way of taking the stress out of cooking at home and many dishes just get better and better with time first up my amazing sticky pork ribs one of the secrets to great cooking is patience leaving dishes to marinade for one or two days helps to develop the flavor in your food and the end result so much more delicious it's a method i use in the restaurants all the time first off get your roasting tray put the tray on the gas pork ribs 60 meat and 35 40 fat give them a really good season salt and pepper nice thing about this cut they stay incredibly moist when they're on the bone and the longer you cook them the more delicious they become and just push all that seasoning in to the pork olive oil in make sure that tray's nice and hot and i really want that nice sort of caramelization taking place on the pork that's the nice thing about starting it on top of the stove use your roasting tray get them colored and then the oven putting the ribs straight in the oven you don't get the color it looks sort of boiled as opposed to a nice caramelized rib ginger you can't beat fresh ginger with sticky pork ribs place it down nice and firmly and slice the thinner you slice the ginger the more fragrant the ribs garlic now it's really important before you add anything to those ribs make sure we've got the color from the ribs first don't rush it turn them over that's what i want that nice crispy color as they sort of braise in the oven all that color just turns into the most amazing flavor braising is just a chef's turn for cooking something slowly in liquid right ginger and garlic in spread it around on all those ribs to sort of roast the ginger and the garlic chili flakes chili flakes in next szechuan pepper citrusy vibrant peppercorns incredible in next staranese that gives it a really nice sort of aniseedy flavor almost like you're roasting the ribs in fennel and now we've got the heat got the spice i want to sweeten things up a little bit some fresh honey honey glazes the pork beautifully counteracts against all that spice in there but look what's happening a colour on the ribs is extraordinary it's like a really nice chili sweet caramel now soy sauce brings that little bit of sort of saltiness to it really generous with the soy sauce japanese vinegar two tablespoons of vinegar in rice wine it gives it that nice sort of um tartness the ribs if you can't find rice wine our dry sherry's a great substitute 300 ml that takes out the heat of that szechuan pepper those dry chili flakes make sure they all lay down like a nice tight box of matches bring that up to the boil cooking is all about learning to develop your own likes and dislikes so always keep tasting to make sure you're happy with the combination of flavors it's lacking a little touch of vinegar all that sharpness now think what's going on the tartness the heat the caramel the color on the ribs is amazing i want a bit of a sort of oniony flavor put some springiness in whilst these ribs are in the oven the spring onions will sort of puree but give a sharpness the final taste of that pork in with my spring onions and with my stock 400 ml of stock this is just a simple chicken stock the stock just sits underneath the ribs it absorbs into the rib and the top of the rib glazes underneath the rib that gets crispy and rich and that's what makes the ribs nice and moist really important into the oven cook at 180 for 30 minutes then turn the ribs over and cook for a further 30 minutes now wow they smell incredible each side has got that really nice crispy roasted edge becomes sticky and chewy and sweet sour the fats disappeared and the pork just melts in your mouth i want to take them to the next level gas back on now shake the tray and this is the sort of the way that we finish them in the restaurant every minute they glaze in that tray they just get to taste better and better now look at them i'm so happy with those ribs done absolutely delicious now but if you want you can put them in the fridge and the flavor will keep developing then just reheat them when you want to serve so [Music] each rib has a nice slice of ginger on there [Music] wow look at that delicious sticky ribs with an amazing marinade to make my food the tastiest it can be i always start with the best ingredients i can find and the secret to getting the best is simple knowledge is crucial the more you know about where your ingredients come from and how they produce the better so ask lots of questions and learn when it comes to buying pork you can't do any better than ask a butcher and award-winning master butcher danny lidgate knows everything about the pig from trotter to tail his family have been in the meat business for 150 years so this man really is on the money in comparison with other meats pork's really good value you get some really good cuts at really reasonable prices and you can use everything from the tip of the trotter down to the cheek we can see here we've got the leg the leg is about this region really lean really good for things like gammons and hams coming down from the leg we've got the loin and that's where the pork chops come from if you take the bones out you can bone and roll it and you end up with a really nice easy to cook cylinder of meat really easy to carve carve like a loaf of bread coming away from the loin we've got the belly and you can see what belly is made up of fatty parts and meaty parts don't be scared of the amount of fat that's on it you need that fat to give give the flavors coming through also make sure you can possibly buy it with the skin on the skin will crispen up nice and give you good crackling also add flavor into the fat lower down from the bellies we've got the shoulders really the shoulders are a great meat they're slightly fattier than the rest of the animal you can see with this pork shoulder the amount of marbling you get in the muscles the interior marbling make sure you look for the marbling it's essential for the flavor and it's going to make a really good eating experience with a pig there really is nothing to waste the trotters even are really good flavor because they're geletinous qualities and the meat can be really really flavoursome also there's pigs cheeks which obviously require a little bit more cooking because of the use they get but the flavors you're gonna get are gonna be completely different to any other part of a pig pork is an incredibly versatile meat they say the only part you can't eat is the oink here's my guide to getting the best out of familiar cuts smoked or unsmoked bacon is not just for breakfast it's brilliant transforming salads gives a real depth of flavor to stews and is delicious in quick and easy pasta dishes [Music] the leg joint best known for ham also makes an inexpensive delicious sunday roast and it's great served with peas pudding and the tenderloin fillet incredibly lean healthy and fast to cook you can stuff it cut it into scallops or strips that are perfect for asian stir fries [Music] a calm kitchen is an efficient and effective kitchen the less stressed you are the better the food you'll produce so whenever you can get ahead with your cooking here are three of my favorite recipes that can be made beforehand and whose flavour improves over time [Music] first up moroccan lamb with sweet potato and raisin [Music] this super simple hassle-free recipe is cooked all in one pot start by browning chunks of lamb in hot olive oil colour and remove then fried onions season add chopped garlic ground ginger and coriander a teaspoon of whole cumin seeds paprika and fennel seeds a cinnamon stick bay leaf and delicate strands of saffron then fry to release all the aromatic flavors next add tomato puree chunks of sweet potato and the juicy brown lamb for a sweet note add plump raisins then cover with stock and simply leave to simmer for a couple of hours delicious eating straight away but over time the flavors will develop and improve when you're ready to serve simply finish with fresh parsley [Music] minimal preparation and ready when you want it fantastic moroccan lamb with sweet potato and raisin my next super simple dish that just gets better and better with thyme is chili chicken with ginger and coriander [Music] start by chopping chicken thighs into pieces now on with the marinade chopped garlic ginger red chili lemon juice [Music] in a pan toast coriander and cumin seeds to release their flavors grind and add to the chicken [Music] then pour over plain yogurt add turmeric and season mix and leave to marinate from two hours to overnight next fry chopped onions in olive oil then

coriander marinated for flavor and cooked in 20 minutes chilli chicken with ginger and coriander a simple stress-free wonder having a delicious sauce on hand to serve with simply cooked fish or meat is a brilliant stress buster my final recipe is sweet pepper sauce with grilled prawns [Music] for the sauce in hot olive oil fry chopped garlic and diced bread [Music] then put them in a blender [Music] add chopped tomatoes [Music] blister the skin of red peppers under a hot grill intensifying the flavor leave to cool then they're easy to peel chop and add blitz add smoked paprika chili flakes and roughly chopped almonds a squeeze of lemon and a dash of sherry vinegar season blitz again and add olive oil [Music] this sauce keeps really well in the fridge and will intensify in flavor i love it with simple king prawns just add olive oil and griddle for two minutes on each side [Music] sweet pepper sauce with grilled prawns simply delicious [Music] made in advance ready when you want them three stunning simple recipes that take the stress out of the kitchen beautiful this is my ultimate cookery course 100 recipes to stake your life on i'll be showing you an amazing spicy chutney that's brilliant for transforming the simplest of suppers they don't actually smell much but the flavor they give off is extraordinary but first five more of my 100 tips to make your home cooking easier kicking off with how to skin and de-bone a fish the hassle-free way this is basically a filleted side of salmon it's been taken off the bone and now skin off pick up your knife a really nice broad flexible filleting knife a little sharpen lift up the base of the towel and then just nick a little bit at the end there twist the knife almost as if it's horizontally underneath the salmon pull the skin and you slice the salmon underneath and let the knife do the work now get your skin flip it back over and check you're not leaving too much salmon on top of the skin pull it back nice and slowly get the skin wrap it around your fingers pull the salmon towards you and then just all the way through lay that down one nicely skinned salmon just like a perfect snakeskin get your knife and just run the knife down and then with a pair of tweezers these are fish tweezers but you can use normal tweezers look for the head up and pull and with the skin being removed from underneath the salmon the pin bones come out a lot easier and the pimples only go to just basically halfway along the fillet one nice fillet of salmon beautiful [Music] there's still plenty of flavor in the trimmings from affiliated fish my tip is don't waste those fish bones add to water why a bay leaf and some chopped veg to make a simple but versatile fish talk at home the perfect base for a delicious fish soup [Music] a great tip for intensely flavored stress-free veg is to steam them in their own juices simply add to a pan with a knob of butter and seasoning then cook on a low heat with a lid on to lock in the moisture [Music] for crispy roast potatoes you can depend on my tip is to par boil them leave them to steam dry then sprinkle them with semolina or flour and give them a good roughing up this ensures they go really crispy in the oven a great tip for browning meat or fish is to dry it with kitchen roll before you cook it then you'll get a much better color too much moisture makes the meat steam instead of sear and you'll lose that rich brown crust like the one i got on those sticky pork ribs another secret to taking the stress out of cooking is to anticipate the really busy times when you'll need things to hand that are already made my next recipe can be kept on tap in the fridge for weeks on end and is guaranteed to liven up any quick meal spicy chutney with chutney standing by in the fridge you can always add that special little touch to a simple supper prove that thinking ahead always pays off pan on start toasting those spices keep the pan nice and low cumin very aromatic very fragrant and it's almost like a light spice next nice little coriander seeds coriander in now you're going to get a bit of heat in the chutney mustard seeds well smaller than coriander seeds but so much more powerful mustard seeds in now curry leaves they don't actually smell much dry but the flavor they give off is extraordinary coli's in really important not to burn them otherwise you'll have that bitter taste across the chutney keep the gas nice and low the secret is sort of toasting them so it releases that oil and intensifies the spice a touch of salt and then a couple of small powerful chilies keep them whole no one's going to eat them but it gives that real nice burst of heat now let them toast gently there we're not going to chop the onion we're going to grate it why because it sort of breaks down to a really nice puree in the chutney when you're grated hold the root in the palm of your hand and just push nice long grates want those nice long shards look i've almost got a nice sort of onion puree but it's nice and clear a touch of olive oil spices nicely toasted onions in [Music] three nice cloves of garlic slightly crushed on [Music] lay it nice and flat and just slice the garlic nice thin slices garlic in taking your time to get the owners caramelised beautifully will really reap rewards in the long run tamarind paste and sugar in with the sugar first three nice tablespoons of sugar that will give a really nice syrup effect sort of nice rich syrupy texture to the chutney tamarind paste you can get tamarind paste in most delis and the big supermarkets it's really nice thickening asian but gives that tartness the chutney and it's sort of rich sugary spicy next in with my coconut add four nice tablespoons that will give a nice body and a really nice texture to the chutney cook that coconut out and now add the carrot grated the carrot just gives the chutney really nice sort of crunch but also helps to sort of cool down the spice carrots in the water comes out the carrot flavors the chutney beautifully but gives that nice sort of vibrant bright color to it as well and grating it almost sort of it cooks instantly but i want a bit of texture through here turn down the gas and just let that simmer for five minutes if the carrots aren't that moist and juicy then put a couple of tablespoons of water in there to help it along now just cook that out for five minutes just as those carrots start going nice and soft don't overcook them you want that nice texture in there slightly spicy slightly sweet gas off keep those chillies in there for that it's beautiful nice and gooey delicious and ready to go in this jar as that sits in the fridge just gets better and better and better i love to eat this chutney with cold meats or even cold fish but with ham it's amazing it's a really nice way of living up the ham just sort of roll it up get a nice spoon of chutney i mean it looks fantastic chutney onto the plate and serve and that is a nice little gem in the fridge that is worth prepping in advance for follow my ultimate cookery course crammed with key lessons top tips 100 recipes to stay your life on and you'll

a delicious nature and you've got like this gourmet trail starting from the back like a little canopy with the eggs and then you go down to the vegetable then all of a sudden you hit the meat right at the very end and then finish with the desserts there's not a street like anywhere in the world i'm on a culinary adventure through india and i've traveled into the wilds of the northeast where i'm on the trail of india's best kept culinary secrets [Music] i've just arrived in nagaland where i'll be staying with the cognac tribe and i'm the first western chef they've ever met hello this is my father gordon sir how are you your father's name uh what do i what do i call him mr it's very kind thank you very much thank you very much that's amazing i know all these people here these are our relatives and villagers you say hello hello hello [Applause] what is that this is all ball yeah and what these bits here uh these are uh intestines intestine and we eat them as well yes yes it's not numbers the tribe might actually enjoy meat more than i do for jin's father has even got a version of one of my favorites on the go so it's like a blood sausage like a black pudding wow look at that black pudding that is delicious that is very good we don't put chili in our blood sausage blank pudding back in the uk you think of any authentic indian food you never ever think about black pudding but that's just completely different thank you and a great cup of tea as well this is how we eat in scotland yeah black pudding yeah and tea he said that because he's good looking and handsome like he has got three wives oh jesus what about you yeah those laws don't apply in ones worth the news the world would love that one he said why don't you come with him tomorrow for the hunt i would love to go hunting he is inviting you i thought it was banned no no no this is tribal land we are the owners of alain right and we have every right to hunt to hunt yes and that's how the village survives yes to think that 50 60 years ago there was tribal gangs warfare revenge and any way to seek revenge was beheaded your victim and that's that's that's not [ __ ] about now i mean that's pretty uh so they all may look nice and smiley and high fives and how you doing sit down have some black pudding and a cup of tea but you want to [ __ ] with them in the jungle would you now for the real reason i'm here i'm going to see what makes a nagaland curry so different to anything i've ever tasted before as i've been gifted the venison mr honly is going to create a curry using the boar that he slaughtered so in there a kidney kidney are you cooking everything at the same time see normally we'd cook this separately it's very rustic nothing's filleted nothing's ever off the boat and what's that dad's putting there my father is uh putting another kind of leaf which you find in the forest and what's it like thank you it's quite citrusy huh yeah yeah it's like lavender we use even the fruits for like pepper everything mr holly is using in his dish comes from his own land this is the first indian curry i've seen made without any dried spices what's that doing with the chilis he's uh roasting it we have a better flavoring if we roast it on the ash like that yeah it gives a better scent yeah but we do the same with peppers and the most surprising ingredient is something i've never seen before it's bamboo shoot yeah that's a fascinating smell you know that slightly spicy edge to it while the pork and the bamboo curry cooks i'm gonna try out these nagaland ingredients with my saddle of venison to see what i can come up with pure fillet just a little touch they intrigued me the flavor there you know [Music] how do you turn up the gas [Music] thank you how many westerners have come and cooking this kitchen none no i'm the first [Music] it's a tradition in scotland we always have a swig each oh yes it means our passion is joined with the dish while my venison curry reduces mr honly's pork and bamboo curry is already done and i can't wait to taste it the pork is delicious very tasty the chili the garlic and it looked quite sort of boring and greasy but flavor-wise delicious that's delicious the pork the villagers from today's hunt that didn't get a cut of the deer came to share mine very nice [Music] yes jordan yep can you just give them a second of course there's real community spirit here and it makes eating together all that more enjoyable the pork dish i tasted of theirs was amazing you'd think that there was 15 different spices the dried bamboo in terms of flavor it's intense yeah it has an intriguing sort of turnip stroke cardamom sort of slightly spicy edge to it who'd ever believe we're in india no spice no turmeric yeah no coriander no cinnamon no clothes everything's just yeah from the ground it's quite interesting you dive into their world and you get rid of that monkey on your back and all of a sudden you start to relax in a big way and forget anything outside this village [Music] has a massive appetite for them today she's attempted to break her own world record for eating 60 whole chilis in two minutes this is no ordinary chili and andita will be munching on the boot jolokia yeah the whole the whole the whole thing but don't eat it don't don't eat it don't eat it just take whatever he's taking them to

Follow...",2022-11-30 22:16:02.926159, [Music] i go fishing a lot and scotch eggs are the perfect all-in-one mini picnic breakfast first thing get your eggs cooked bring the water up the boil onto the spoon and lower them into the water that way they don't hit the water and crack four and a half minutes that'll keep the center nice and slightly runny now ground sausage meat i'm gonna make mine a little bit spicier i'm gonna crumble in black pudding that helps to season the scotch eggs inside a little touch of salt and pepper and then just to make it a little bit sweeter and a lot easier for the kids to eat some grated apple [Music] combine that blend in the apple and the black pudding eggs once they're cooked drain them and then run them under cold water cracking and cooling the eggs quickly will prevent the yolks turning gray tap them on the side of the pan put them back into the water and what happens the water seeps underneath the shell see the shell come off so much easier eggs still slightly soft in the center i want that little bit of richness with the yolk next you need to get yourself organized with a mini assembly line seasoned flour a little egg wash and breadcrumbs take your mince golf ball size spread the pate manipulate with your thumb and then sit your egg in there and spread the sausage over the egg and you just seal that over it's really important to keep that nice even coating of sausage meat around the egg you don't want it too thick otherwise it gets too dense and it's unappetizing give them a light dusting in the seasoned flour if you don't put the flour on the egg wash won't stick if you don't put the egg wash on the breadcrumbs won't stick into the egg roll it round shake off any excess egg wash and roll it into your breadcrumbs you can use this same three-stage method to breadcrumb anything you like from chicken goujons and fish fillets to fina schnitzel these are panko breadcrumbs japanese white breadcrumb so no crust you can experiment by adding flavours to your breadcrumbs like parmesan herbs or citrus zest i always like to push the actual breadcrumbs into the sausage meat so it gets that really nice golden brown and stops any of the outside burning once bread crumbs lower the eggs carefully into a four centimeter deep bath of hot vegetable oil for 10 to 12 minutes the eggs are actually cooked soft and running the center so the objective is just to cook the sausage meat and the black pudding look great don't they go and grenades there's something so magical about a scotch egg on a picnic because it's like this little mini breakfast beautiful drain them onto the paper roll them round just to get off any excess oil and then to transport them some greaseproof paper that for me is the perfect start to the fishing trip there's no wonder i never catch any fish because i'm always too busy eating my scotch eggs [Music] my ultimate black pudding lace scotch eggs an irresistibly delicious picnic breakfast my ultimate picnic keeps it simple with dishes that all work brilliantly well together and that's one of the secrets you have to treat a picnic like a celebration meal make sure you've got a stunning selection and a great balance of tastes and textures but above all make sure it's fun i've saved my three most indulgent dishes for a tea time picnic treat a stunning prawn and cucumber salad with a spicy yogurt dressing a simply delicious anchovy dip and a sticky chocolate fridge cake that won't fail to revive a flag in family until he's keen to get in on the action [Music] what are your favorites a marshmallow and peanut fridge cake perfect for a picnic first things first we have to slowly melt the chocolate that's bad that's good i'm gonna break up the chocolate right in there next butter goes in couple tablespoons of golden syrup it's so good if we melt chocolate too quickly it starts to separate and destroy the best and safest way to melt chocolate is always use a bain-marie but i'm going to keep a really close eye on mine and heat it over a super low heat this stunning little cake has your favorites in there our digestives now put your hands in there and give them like that one at a time ago and crush what's the one thing that you love about a picnic i love eating outside especially on a nice summery day not so much in the winter though no that's gonna be the crunchy part of our fridge cake and it's called a fridge cake because it can sit in the fridge or you can freeze it now peanuts in please can you use it without peanuts if you're allergic to peanuts oh you can do yeah definitely now what are these little babies cranberries cranberries from there marshmallows my favorite okay they're so bright aren't they why do you love marshmallows so much because they're so squishy all right give that a nice mix up chocolate is melting nicely okay i want you to pour that in and i'll mix it nice and gently slowly slowly slowly soon nice now touch more please good isn't it good give that a little mix with daddy please look they're all melty nice and creamy and gooey now we're gonna line the tray so this is quite easy to make because um you don't have to bake it mm-hmm you just set it yeah i want you to start pushing it into the corners please with your fingers just laying it nice and flat ah it's all nice and marshmallow and oozy to get the spatula okay and look how delicious does that look really delicious i can eat it right now i couldn't because it's not set so when that sets okay it'll go nice and firm and then we can cut it into little bars little squares triangles triangles push push good but the important part pushing it down is that we can slice it and the more we push the thinner we can slice okay [Music] fridge cake's done now i'm gonna make the most amazing anchovy dip with vegetables and bread first cut slices of baguette and bake in the oven at 180 degrees c for six minutes or until crisp meanwhile roughly chopped garlic and shallots and add to a food processor along with a tin of good quality anchovies [Music] sprinkle in some pitted black olives flat leaf parsley and drizzle in the reserved anchovy oil and a little olive oil blitz to a paste and add pepper then decant into a jar ready to transport serve with a handful of fresh baby carrots peppery radishes and your crisp baguette toast anchovy dip a portable and deliciously palatable alfresco treat [Music] now a spicy chilli yogurt dressing with a prawn salad first things first i'd like you to make the dressing fish sauce doesn't really smell like fishes so one and a half tablespoons of fish sauce two chilli i like this especially if you have it on the side of the form a little teaspoon of sugar oh that's it good and so four tablespoons of yogurt three four zest in there why are you making it in a jam jar not a bowl well this is for a little picnic and it's a great way of transporting we squeeze the lime in there and then we put [Music] it's a bit like a tummy see that sounds like my tummy only sometimes only sometimes thank you for that kind of gives you the first time you have it's like a little thingy it's fresh salty citrusy but delicious now cucumber and the salad i want to get rid of all the seeds so if you just nice and gently peel the cucumber why do you feel it can you not eat the skin on it you can eat the skin but i want this salad to taste light and fresh you can use a knife for this too though can't you you can peel with a knife but a speed peeler takes off the slices nice and thinly so much quicker so much quicker that's why it's called a speed peeler looks better now looks a bit naked it does look a bit naked doesn't it now you get your spoon let's see what happens a teaspoon just takes out all those seeds so whilst it sits in the dish it doesn't make the salad go all soft because that cucumber is nice and crunchy [Music] that's really good there you go so see where your knuckles are there that's what's always going to protect if you put that little finger out this little piggy boom comes off what did i tell you about daddy's knuckle that's the first place you cut off all the time there you go the next addition to our prawn salad is firm juicy baby gem lettuce look at the lettuce in half what about the butt the butts [Music] i'm keeping the butts on for now so when i slice it it stays together okay and then a little bit there we don't use okay when you prepare lettuce for a picnic you never slice it too thinly okay otherwise it will it's good prawns are ready [Music] your tummy sauce is ready your dressing is ready take the lid off and the trick is you dress the bottom of your dish because i'm going to put the prawns on here to protect the lettuce get your cucumber i put my cucumber on and then finally that is okay now the salad is not going to go soft why is that because it's not that it's not straight onto the dressing that's right what happens is we wrap this now and then we get to our picnic drizzle the sauce on top we mix it up we've got the dressing on the bottom and the dressing on top of the dressing that's right a little bit of tim film do you know the cling film check i don't know the clint field trick yet no thing fell over the top of the toilet what you don't understand it when you're my age oh you've been my age then well okay salad in the

million bucks and i'm gonna show you how first up my flavor-packed lamb with fried bread whether i'm cooking high-end dishes or rustic dishes trust me it all has to be impressive so this lamb dish proves that you don't have to spend a fortune to create delicious food first off put the pan on this is a lamb steak and it's cut just above the leg just here because you can see that delicious bone running through the center and that's full of marrow so that just gives the lamb a nice added sweet flavor just take your knife cut through each end this stops the lamb steak from buckling so therefore it cooks evenly and colors beautifully salt and pepper lamb needs quite a lot of help with the pepper so be quite generous with the pepper and just pat that down the pan is just under smoke on the outside now put the oil in get that pan really nice and hot because this is a cheap cut so i'm depending on the color of the lamb steak to really sort of impart a lot of flavor that's the noise you want to hear you can't hear that noise don't drop the steak in put a little bit of garlic in there not chopped garlic just whole cloves the garlic lightly crushed don't even waste time peeling them in tongs lift up that bit of fat around the back that's the top of the leg tilt the pan and let all that fat render rendering is a chef's term that means melting the fat it works brilliantly when you're cooking a rib eye as well cut it that over there beautiful now it looks like an expensive cut and we've got that nice even sear all over as it's cooking just tilt the pan and vase and basting the lamb steak just means you're sort of adding all that nice scented garlic olive oil back into the lamb useful now take the lamb out let the lamb rest [Music] now for the perfect rustic crouton so this bread's quite firm a couple of days old just slice it straight down the center dice it up put it into a bowl season it beautifully [Music] from there i'm gonna add some milk sounds strange adding milk to crouton but it just gives it that nice rich creamy texture and just let that milk sort of absorb into the bread while that's soaking i'm gonna make the dressing go back to that initial garlic that was in the pan look at that beautiful into the pest and water anchovies anchovies go brilliantly well with lamb i want that nice salty vinegary flavor and a bit of kick some capers the little baby cats very sweet now just pound that to a nice paste that smells incredible next some dijon mustard a nice teaspoon and a half in a little bit of red wine vinegar two tablespoons and then our extra virgin olive oil now it's got that heat in there i've got a nice roasted garlic a real hearty chunky vinaigrette that sort of seeps into that lamb some fresh parsley crunch up the parsley delicious flavor parsley in nice now get your pan hot for the croutons olive oil in the pan grab the croutons and squeeze all that excess milk out not too hard i don't want them dry and in and then just fry them and the milk inside these croutons give it a nice spongy creamy delicious flavor that's the color i want nice now take them out and lightly drain them a little bit of kitchen roll onto the board out [Music] plate them just take this amazing vinaigrette and spread it get those croutons listen to them like little boulders hitting the play the lamb sit that on next one on the rest of the croutons on now use all those little bits and my chef in paris would kill me right now if you saw me using those because they're the ugly scraps that customers should never see but but they're the best bits croutons on and then just drop that sauce on all those little bits of the lamb and there that is a perfect way of taking a cheap cut is the premier league of dishes stunning food doesn't have to be complicated keeping it simple produces amazing results and keeps costs down here are three more great easy dishes that don't cost the earth but taste absolutely incredible starting with

don't have to spend a fortune to eat amazing food at home nice [Music] five more of my 100 tips they'll make cooking in the kitchen easier first up a great cheap staple how to cook the perfect rice basmati rice the king of all rice is light fluffy delicious and i'm going to show you how to cook it perfectly now start off with 400 grams of rice rice in spot on so what i'm going to do now is just rinse off the dust and the starch cold water always and just rinse the rice that stops the rice from becoming clumpy in the pan and allows it to become really nice light and fluffy once it's cooked rice into the pan now to make a plain fluffy rice exciting we're going to infuse it three cardamom pods and just get the pods and just pierce them so it allows all that flavor to come out cardamom pods and then star anise now these are beautiful whole star anise it makes it really nice and fragrant salt and pepper a lot easier to season the rice now than it is once it's cooked you start to break it up when you season once it's cooked now it's basically one part rice to one and a half part water 600 mils always start off in cold water cold water in onto the gas lid on bring it up to the ball as quick as possible and turn it down and let it simmer for 8 to 10 minutes and that's the secret behind cooking great rice allow it to steam as it's cooking do not lift that lid up lid off [Music] it smells aromatic basically all the water's absorbed the rice has doubled in size and is nice and light and fluffy take the staranise out the cardamom pods they all should have risen to the top pods out take your fork fluff it through basically just sort of starts to open everything back up once you've forked it through it becomes really nice and light and fluffy and there that is perfectly cooked rice always make the most of your leftovers use last night's rice in stir fries scrambled up with eggs or it's simple to make a delicious fresh salad remember a good cook wastes nothing a great tip for stopping potatoes apples and avocados from going brown wing cut simply cover with water and add a squeeze of lemon the acidity stops the flesh from oxidizing which is what causes the color to change herbs are great for adding flavor without spending a fortune to keep them at their best simply place them in a glass of water and they'll stay fresh for up to a week [Music] and if you've got extra herbs left over save and waste by making an amazing flavoured oil place wash and dried stems in a bottle cover with warmed olive oil then seal and leave to infuse great for salads pastas and drizzling on veg [Music] this is my ultimate cookery course 100 recipes to stake your life on later i'll be showing you an incredible spicy sausage rice that cost next to nothing bulky delicious and incredibly robust but first when you're cooking on a budget you can still eat fantastic meats just make sure you're getting the most for your money next up my shopping guide to buying the best hams salamis and sausages these fine italian meats are packed with flavour and a little goes a long way and nobody knows that better than deli maestro antonio sakamani i born in italy and i start eating italian food and i love it i want to change it for nothing else that's why i'm fat he's been selling delicious cured meats in the heart of london soho for more than 35 years this is the best prosciutto they come from italy this is curing parma because it's parma ham divine people love it and it's wonderful the fat is good because you make the meat sweet they should be cut thin like this there is more flavor you can eat with melon with figs with pears with everything any sweet fruit is good it's wonderful you really enjoy when you start eating you can stop wonderful this is called prisaola it's a hair cured beef it comes from north italy valtelina it's so different from pork there's no fat at all it should be no fun otherwise it tastes greasy it's good when it's very dry and you slice it thinner you just eat it like that or you can eat with a bit of rocket or you save some parmesan on top i love it a bit of lemon if you like or olive oil it's delicious this is called felino for me is the best salami take the name of our little place near parma and other is country salami very nice it's one of my favorite because it's not too spicy just meat flavor just salt and pepper i love it i can't resist when i take some meat home i don't eat nothing else especially in the evening just meat with a melon or fish or whatever a few slices of bread a couple glasses of wine that's my meal you don't need nothing else you know you you happy antonio's right incredible italian hams and salamis are fantastic in simple salads sandwiches or even eaten by themselves and you don't need much to make an impression there's an amazing selection of delicious meats from around the world that are great to use in the kitchen another simple meaty staple that's perfect for quick easy suppers with a difference are the exotic regional speciality sausages that have such distinctive tastes and are a million miles from the great british banger here are four of my favorites that are definitely worth your money chirizo from spain these have an incredibly deep red color are full of smoky spiced paprika and are great for stuffing stews and paellas merguez from north africa made from beef and mutton these cook super fast because of the long and thin shape and can be used in tagines or served with couscous fennel sausages from italy made from pork and packed with sweet aniseed flavor fennel seeds these are perfect with pasta or as a topping on a pizza finally jerk sausages from jamaica full of blow your head off scotch bonnet chilis these are super spicy and great in tangy casseroles or simply sauteed with onions and garlic be adventurous with your sausages learn about the different flavors and you'll soon be using them to add extra flavor with ease for dishes that always pack a punch without costing a fortune simple and cheap delicious ingredients like sausages are great and you don't need a lot of them to get stunning dishes that taste incredible so spend your money wisely and you can have amazing midweek meals that don't cost the earth my next recipe is all about great flavors and it's as cheap and easy to make as it is delicious spicy sausage rice whatever you're cooking the secret to making great food is to ensure you're locking every last ounce of flavour in that pan and this spicy sausage rice does exactly that take these spicy sausages and pierce that skin because i want all that delicious spicy sausage meat out of this casing and you get more flavor from the sausage when you take them out the casing sausage is ready turn on the gas bread onion less acidic than a big white spanish onion and a lot more flavoursome tablespoon of olive oil a tablespoon only because i want all that fat coming out the sausages to sort of really help flavor the onions onions in and the onions go in first because you can never rush cooking an onion it's really important to sort of give them five to six minutes in the pan so you can really start to caramelize them my mouth and my pepper slice around wasting nothing i want to see that sort of little core those pips in the center no fine diced pepper the rice is going to be cooking for 20 minutes so i want the veg to sort of have texture after it's cooked peppers in a bit of garlic two nice cloves just slap down off with the shell garlic in now i want to turn up the gas get the pan nice and hot because the minute that sausage goes in everything cools down and you'll end up boiling the peppers and the onions and the garlic so heat up to maximum and then just make a well in the center in now start stirring quickly this is where you get so much more bang for your buck out of sausages because the skins off and the real flavor of that spicy italian sausage is gonna come through what's great about this recipe is that you can use any type of sausage to get the flavor and the heat you want i've gone for the spicy italian but it's just as good with merguez or cheeto a teaspoon paprika in give it that really nice smoky flavor rice in and we're gonna sort of basically sear the rice we call it in the kitchen blasting the rice where we sort of soda the rice for 30 seconds and it takes on all that flavor next white wine so the wine sort of deglazes the pan and washes all that flavor from the bottom of the pan into the rice stock in bring it up to the boil turn it down and let it simmer [Music] double stop to rice turn that gas down and let it simmer for 12 to 15 minutes and just give it the occasional stir keep an eye on it now get ready to finish it slice spring onions diced sweet juicy tomatoes and roughly chop earthy flat leaf parsley spring onions in tomatoes in off with the gas really important otherwise everything becomes overcooked flat leaf parsley in but look at the volume in that pan now that is an amazing way to take spicy italian sausages to a completely different level beautiful [Music] follow my ultimate cookery course packed with key lessons top tips and 100 recipes to stake your life on and you'll literally be cooking yourself into a better chef many of these amazing recipes are on my app please check out the app store for details go on get cooking welcome to my ultimate cookery course packed with cooking tips information and 100 recipes to stay your life on right this is more ultimate food on a budget [Music] vegetables are such an asset in the kitchen healthy fantastically fresh and incredibly versatile and pound for pound they're so much cheaper than fish or meat just make sure you give them plenty of attitude my first recipe is so quick and easy but seriously impressive and deceptively cheap homemade gnocchi making your enoki is so simple to do yet the results are absolutely stunning and it's a great way of using up leftover baked potatoes you can make noki just with flour and eggs however the potato gives it a nice light sort of creamy fluffy texture cut them in half take your spoon and scoop the inside of those potatoes i'm using leftover baked potatoes but this really works as well with leftover ball potatoes two choices you can get a fork and sort of mash the potato and get it nice and light and fluffy or this little gadget it's called a ricer i suppose it's a posh word for a potato masher just squeeze gently you can see how nice and light it is almost like fluffy little strands of potato you can do this when the potatoes are hot it'll go through the rice so much quicker just slice that off there now a nice spoon of okata ring a little touch of salt and pepper it's really important to season the mixture as we go along otherwise the nokia becomes really bland flour over the ricotta sieved so there's no lumps one delicious egg give that a little whisk now make a little well in the center you want a nice soft pliable ball of dough give that a really good mix get some thyme flowers in there and this time is light fragrant and it's just a really nice herb and with the ricotta it tastes brilliant just pick the little tips the time flowers next flour your hands generously and knead the mixture into a dough fold in and push and basically what it's doing is get it nice and smooth as it starts to get a little bit wet and just add a little touch of flour we want something really nice and soft now don't overwork it it stops the nokia from expanding when it hits the pan that's exactly what i want a nice sort of soft fragrant ball cut the ball in half lightly flour the hands and just roll it gently just think of a big long cigar the mixture will start getting a little bit sort of wetter but do not add lots of flour now lightly flour the knife so when you slice the gnocchi it doesn't stick cut the dough into bite-sized pieces just take your finger dip it in the flour and push down why i want my nokia to look like a pillow and for me the most important part there is that not one of them are identically the same shape water on bring up to the boil little touch of olive oil in there lightly flour your hand lift up the gnocchi in to the rolling boiling water turn that pan to stop them from sticking at the bottom and let them simmer and they start to sort of tell you they're cooked when they start floating get a pan on get that nice and hot now they're just starting to come up to the top and you can continue cooking them like that i like blanching them in the water taking them out and then frying them to study the gnocchi heat olive oil in a frying pan gently lift up and look they've doubled in size drain it get rid of the excess water and straight in to the hot pan [Music] this is where they start to take on a completely different texture nice crisp sauteed texture on the outside nokia loves fresh pepper so pepper in and see as i start turning them i've got this really nice little sort of brown color and they're almost popping up now like little parcels so i want them nice and sauteed both sides but light and creamy in the center fresh garden peas in and the butter gives it a really nice sort of bernoulli flavor on the end beautiful a little bit of fresh thyme over the peas and then finally i want to lift it up fresh lemon zest the lemon over [Music] smells incredible and then finally seal the deal with a touch of grated parmesan cheese give your vegetable attitude and you'll get amazingly elegant dishes on a budget that are always guaranteed to impress what more do you want from great cooking cheap to make easy to cook and absolutely stunning cooking great food doesn't mean you have to spend a fortune on fancy equipment get some basic essentials and you'll be set in the kitchen saucepans i mean basically you don't need a collection of ten all you need really is two a medium size one followed by a large one a small pan is great for sauces heating liquids or rice whereas your large pan gives you space perfect for pastas stews or when you're cooking in bulk which keeps costs down made from copper to stainless steel find what's right for you and always get a lid which helps heat the pan up as quickly as possible and the secret behind a great saucepan is the heavier the bottom the more heat it will conduct the thinner the bottom the more chance you've got actually burning your food buy the best saucepans you can afford take good care of them and they'll last you years saving you money in the long run amazing recipes don't necessarily have to include meat cooking vegetarian dishes will reduce your food bills without compromising on taste and flavor here are three more recipes to satisfy even the keenest carnivore like me that will max out on veg and won't break the bang [Applause] starting with spicy black beans with feta and avocado [Music] first in a pan heat olive oil add chopped onion and fry until soft then finely slice garlic and chili add cumin cinnamon and black beans then combined cooked together until deliciously soft these small beans come dried or in tins and they're a great cheap ingredient to make dishes more substantial to serve dollop the black bean mixture on crunchy tortillas topped with cubed ripe avocado chopped fresh coriander and crumbled salty feta cheese spicy black beans with feta an avocado a dish has filling frugal and tastes fantastic my next great veg recipe is leaking green rusty with fried [Music] eggs in a hot pan sweat shredded leeks along with a knob of butter and seasoning next great parboiled potatoes and grill a hard swiss cheese with a great nutty flavor then combine with the softened leeks in a pan heat oil and a little butter spoon in the potato leek and cheese mix cook gently until golden and crisp underneath then slide onto a plate flip over and return to the pan to finish cooking [Music] finally for the perfect topping fry two eggs and place them on top of the rosty top with fresh tarragon [Music] leaking gria rosti with fried eggs a simple but substantial dish that makes the most of hearty root veg addisha takes as much time to write on a blackboard as it does to cook chickpea cumin and spinach coffees with tahini dressing [Music] in a blender put tin chickpeas cumin seeds paprika and turmeric and blitz to a paste [Music] next we'll spinach in olive oil and chop finely then add to the chickpea mixture sprinkle in gram flour made from finely ground chickpeas then shape golf ball-sized chunks of the mixture using a spoon and rest in the fridge when ready to cook heat oil in a frying pan shallow fry the coppers until golden brown on all sides then rest them on kitchen paper to absorb any excess oil for an easy dipping sauce mix yogurt with a dollop of tahini and a squeeze of lemon and stir in freshly chopped coriander a mouth-watering dish that's perfect for sharing chickpea cumin and spinach coffees with tahini dressing [Music] three amazing recipes with fantastic veg proof that even if you're cooking on a budget you can still eat like a king incredible welcome back to my ultimate cookery course [Music] this is how to cook amazing food on a budget next up my guide to getting the best ingredients for your money my shopping mantra is simple first rely on your senses make sure whatever you're buying that it looks smells and really feels good second is to recognize that knowledge is crucial the more you know personally about where your ingredients are from and how they produce the better so don't be scared ask lots of questions and learn [Music] and when it comes to buying potatoes a great ingredient if you're cooking on a budget one green grocer who can always spot a duds bud is borough market royalty fred foster it's all about flavour it's all about choosing the right variety for the right dish he's been selling top quality veg for over 15 years and really knows his king edwards from his duke of yorks basically there's two types of potatoes there's early season and a main crop potato early season is basically round about may time you can't store them they cannot be stored you have to buy them and use them within two to three days when you're buying an early season potato you must avoid green looking potatoes at all costs it really is important and the way you can tell that is if you just brush the potato the skin comes off really really easy and then you want you want a yellowy or whitey looking potato the new seasoned potato is a superb potato to use new season types include rocket home guard and marist bard but my favorite is the classic jersey royal it has a delicate sweet flavor it's packed with vitamin c and is great in salads or simply boiled and mixed with olive oil and fresh mint jersey potatoes early crop are phenomenal look at that keep the skin on it's really important just wash it boil it it's a beautiful beautiful potato and that's what we're talking about we're talking about i know it's a potato i know it's a bit sad but we're talking about flavour right then what is a main crop potato it's the crop that is grown specifically for nine months of the year use when you're looking at a main crop potato you need to see that the eyes aren't too large because they tend to go right through the potato they've got to be firm it's very very important if a potato in any way feels a little bit soft discard it storage wise dark place cool place dry place and that will last until you eat it simple as that both early season and main crop potatoes come in two main types waxy and flowery waxy potatoes have a smooth dense flesh and because they're low in starch they stay firm when cooked types include anya and pink fur but i love charlotte which has an amazing buttery taste and a great sauteed in stews or serves whole with roast chicken flowery potatoes have a fluffy dry texture when cooked which makes them great for mashing roasting or cutting into chips types include king edward whose smooth creamy flesh is perfect for potato gratins or with rich meats like beef and desiree which have an amazing red skin and are great for bacon or as delicious potato wedges old-fashioned types known as heritage potatoes are now widely available and have fantastic colours and distinctive tastes that are great when you want something different this one's called salad blue when you cut it you then see the most amazing color and it's perfect it looks stunning on the plate are really popular it's so important when you're going out to pick your potatoes you already know in advance what you're going to do with that potato so whether you're going to put it in a salad whether it's a masher or a chipper or even a baking potato each variety has a unique flavor fred's spot on whether new season main crop waxy or flowery potatoes are incredibly versatile and packed with great flavor the perfect ingredient when you're cooking on a budget well how much do i love potatoes well cook them simply proper flavors it doesn't get any better [Music] like all chefs for me there's nothing better than seasonal produce at its peak when fruit and veg is fresh in season and fantastically ripe i can't wait to get back in the kitchen to get the most out of your cooking always use ingredients in their prime my next recipe is a proper british classic that's super simple to cook and cost next to nothing a delicious apple crumble crumbles are the perfect way to use fruit when it's in season there's lots of it about it's nice and cheap but most importantly the fruit's at its absolute best first off i'm gonna make a really nice light caramel pan on nice and low great to apples [Music] and this helps to almost sort of puree the apples so much quicker there's a lot of flavor in the skin so don't worry about peeling the fruit whether it's pears plums peaches flavors in the skin nice to start the caramel a couple of tablespoons of sugar the sugar helps to get rid of the tartness in the apple a touch of cinnamon that starts to make it a little spicy open up your vanilla just scrape out all those seeds now this just makes it light and fragrant all those seeds in to the sugar when making caramel be patient and always swirl the dish instead of stirring it when the sugar goes brown add the apple that starts to sort of cool down the caramel but it gives it a really nice sort of caramelized puree apple's almost disintegrating smells incredible turn the gas down slice up two apples it's a crumble that's got no frills straight forward no faffing around no peening of the skin i want them to sort of stand out from the caramel apples in now those nice thick chunks of apple sort of almost bedding itself into the puree dried cranberries gives it that nice sort of shock in the texture sweet and chewy i want it to sort of taste zesty spicy so sit the lemon zest on top of your apples and cranberry fresh lemon juice over and that just gives that extra acidic kick takes the cranberries the apples the caramel and the cinnamon to another level turn the gas off so that that sits and let's concentrate on the crumble flour in a couple of tablespoons of demerara sugar sugar helps to get the topping nice and crispy butter in [Music] give that a nice little rub what we're looking for is like a a bread crumb mixture lightly season it with a touch of cinnamon and the demerara sugar sort of helps to get a nice fine crumble mix and it stops the butter from sort of melting in that flour so that's the basic crumble mix but i'm not finished yet muesli two-thirds crumble one-third muesli mix that in if you haven't got muesli then crunchy granola works brilliantly too lovely now start off in the center and work your way around i want the crispiness on the top the puree on the bottom of the caramel and then the texture in the center a good tip turn the gas back on i want it bubbling before it goes in the oven because then you just got to cook the top so as soon as you see that caramel starting to bubble down the side and she goes let's go bake at 200 degrees celsius for 12 to 14 minutes until golden brown smells amazing beautiful still bubbling [Music] and look at it a delicious but very simple crumble with apples at their absolute best beautiful [Music] next my tricks of the trade and kitchen tips first up cooking pasta a great budget basic to keep in the cupboard it can be easily undercooked or overcooked here's how to do it properly first water in nice large pan to make sure the pasta's got sufficient room to cook evenly nicely seasoned absolutely crucial olive oil in that stops the pasta from sticking together bring it up to the ball that's the rolling boil the secret there it stops the pasta from sticking together and it gently rolls it around now this is angel pasta nice thin pasta takes three and a half to four minutes so into the pan as it hits the water it melts and then you turn it round tongs as that starts to melt gently twist that into the pan bring it back up to the boil if you're bad at timing then set a timer beautiful to test it lift a little strand and you can actually feel it with your fingers it's still nice and firm al dente not a bite not a strong bite but just really nice and firm inside definitely not crunchy and then into a colander drain the pasta in a light seasoning salt and pepper a tablespoon of olive oil mix that through that stops it from sticking together and look there you go beautiful pasta al dente and cooked perfectly a tip for making the most of spare bread blitz leftovers into breadcrumbs great for stuffing or crab cakes or cut into chunks and freeze for perfect croutons on demand or simply tear a news in a delicious rustic salad dried pulses like chickpeas or lentils are great for soups and stews and cost pennies but don't season them until the end of the cooking or the salt makes them go tough for perfect boiled potatoes always start them off in cold water and never boiling water this way by the time the centers of the potatoes are cooked the outside won't be falling apart and when you're cooking potatoes always cook extra so there's leftovers they're fantastic to have on hand for making my delicious gnocchi and potato rusties for a classic bubbling squeak [Music] [Applause] [Music] follow my ultimate cookery course packed with

you so much well done hero staying with the deruva tribe has been a real eye-opener incredible they have nothing yet they've developed these ingenious techniques on how to cook delicious food quite touching amazing stuff sema's got an invite to cook with a real rajput prince nicknamed bozo he's an expert on desert cuisine and champions radishan's culinary traditions hello bozo hi how are you welcome what an amazing place welcome to rajasthan thank you so much we're gonna head off to the desert okay and do a bit of um cooking and all that and rest of them are gonna join us later okay look forward to it shall we hello thank you yeah please yeah that was a journey and a half i'm the only hoi polloi around here bozos are cut above his real name is parikshit and he's a maharaja of john paul's nephew how old is this this is this is this has been there since 1952. that's fine there we go we're traveling 55 kilometers into the desert to bozo's camp amazing it looks beautiful it is nothing good amazing it's just awesome raw so we're unstuck i'm cooking for bozo's desert dinner party tonight and he's teaching me a slow cooked meat dish called could god gosh made with goat very basic there's nothing much no there's no finery in this as i call it in india so this is basically tenderizing the goat it's just tenderizing the goat this is something you grew up with this is what yeah this is this is pretty much the kind of stuff where one sort of always grew up seeing all the elders like uncles and they were my father and they were in cooking when we went out shooting initially now with the masalas the goat leg will be smothered in a masala mix made with chilli and turmeric and now for one local spices it's very indigenous to rajasthan you won't probably get it anywhere else it's something which we call over here kachori cuttery yeah and it's it's it's it's a family of milan and it's it works as a tenderizer it also so it gives it that little tangy flavor fresh kachori comes from a small brown melon and is only found in rajasthan mix the ghee mix the ghee wow this helps to keep it juicy and doesn't let you know things dry up too much take it out now comes the surprising bit we moisten sackcloth and muslin then lay banana leaves on top which we'll use to wrap up the goat now what we need to do is get the indian bread bread the chapatis party so it's almost like a wellington like a goat wellington we have a filler beef wellington okay a traditional you know sort of 70s retro dish wrapped in a pancake then pastry okay it's lined with mushrooms so yeah it absorbs it it absorbs yeah that that's what it's uh that's the general idea it's a whole meal itself yeah yeah this particular recipe was brought to me by one of our old old family chefs he's still around can't see very much but he's he's probably one of the best uh cooks i've known now for the messy part right what do you have to do is take the masala massage in massage it into the meat and the rest of it to spread around everywhere yep okay good so i can see bozo's not a man that likes getting his hands dirty he's used to having servants around so okay here we go take this wow try to hold that and then come as you come around well i think it'll hold itself now okay right you can do that but i think i i just all right chef i'm sorry about that no no no i was trying to help you get me through the shitty [ __ ] you're in there doing the glamorous bits because you want to wrap it up yeah right now you can wrap that up [ __ ] see you next tuesday go on come back come back we need you we need to do the ditch come back please please gordon please i'm coming back we can't finish it without you thank god i wasn't your chef in your palace 20 years ago i swear to god your ice cream would never be the same so i was trying to hold that on there for you so you can wrap the rest i think bozo considers me good below stairs material any other little shitty [ __ ] you want me to do chef if you pulled out i'll just attach it right thank you thank you thank you nice and tight now we've wrapped it up we just need a bit of wire to just tie it up and it's 300 years recipe is ready to be cooked okay where's the oven yeah because the oven is going to be something which you my dear friend are going to dig oh come on come on hey where are you i've made your spices yeah i've wiped your nose i've peeled your garlic i've chopped the onions well you know you've got to get the whole desert experience the hair is displayed oh come on that's the ground you've got to dig up a bit we need about three feet deep three feet wide yeah and three feet right long this is a square bit you're spoiled i am and you know what better way to get someone as great as chef as you to do this for us you just need to bid your back a little more i suppose and you might need to come around this way i'm imagining that this is a certain person's face that bit more and then we are done last time i dug this deep i was in the second household of britain it's gedness have you heard of skegness no i haven't yeah yeah we used to holiday there fish and chips and dinner so what were you digging for there i was playing sandcastles oh that's perfect [Music] now we're surrounding the wrap goat with hot coals and burying it in sand pit cooking was developed by the desert nomads who wanted to travel light without cooking utensils [Music] that one is perfect now it's going to be in there for say about two hours let me pull it out and i'll hope for the best really i think i deserve a beer i think i do too you deserve [ __ ] all right oh god come on i taught you everything okay bozo's dinner guests aren't slumming out here his sevens have laid on some home comforts in the dunes i feel like bloody captain caveman that looks fantastic it's just a red we need to open it up a bit nice all right got the knife and forks there we are please excuse my fingers thank you which one is please bozo that is delicious what a wonderful way of cooking goat what's nice is the you're getting all the spices without being you know chili hot it's wet with the bread around the outside which i didn't think would be tasty but the bread absorbs the juices it takes the juices and it's sort of pregnant with the spices so there's one thing i've learned tonight since being in the desert is sticking to tradition tradition the tradition well done [Music]

first recipe is so easy it removes the stress from cooking and is a pleasure to make chili beef lettuce wraps cooking should never be a chore the more you cook the more confident you become that way you actually start to enjoy it and that's the key to good cooking have a bit of fun along the way this is minced beef and minced pork the pork needs to sit in there otherwise the beef's gonna dry out it's really important to season the mince before you cook it pan nice and hot a touch of olive oil mince in breaking up like that really helps to sort of separate it so we can fry it off with a lot of color with your spoon just go through and start breaking that up the most important thing to remember is mint is made up of cheap cuts brisket belly short rib so it needs help and frying off the mince for color it's so important if this pan wasn't hot your mince is going to boil it's a horrible gray color on there and there's no flavor on your mince taste a little bit [Music] tastes delicious it's seasoned beautifully see how crispy it's going take it much further than you ever taken mince before nice and crispy smells incredible i'm draining it it's crucial it keeps the mints nice and crispy and you get rid of that excess fat that's lovely now just wipe out the pan then wash it low gas now we're going to add texture to the mince finely chopped chili ginger garlic and spring onions spring onions give this sort of mince a really nice freshness because it just gives that crunch nice and thinly now i'm gonna fry off the chilis the ginger the garlic first sesame seed oil teaspoon only in garlic chili ginger in fry that off nicely the sesame seed oil just lifts up the whole flavour brown sugar that starts to really caramelize the chili the garlic and the ginger mince in now my fish sauce that gives it the saltiness you can see now why it's so important to get that mince really crispy because nothing's going soggy staying really crispy fresh lime that makes the mince fragrant and then lime juice roll it and squeeze that in there [Music] incredible i've got the salty i've got the heat i've got the sweetness now i've got the acidicness as well and then finally my spring onions in right at the last minute so i've got crunch in there as well smells amazing literally cook the mince now with sort of 30 seconds to go off and take it out looks incredible smells so inviting [Music] to go with the chili beef i'm making a simple sweet and spicy dipping sauce so everyone can dress the crispy mince to their own taste dipping sauce a little teaspoon the brown sugar soy sauce gives it a nice sort of dark rich color sesame seed oil a tablespoon and just top that up with a tablespoon of olive oil that stops the sesame seed all becoming too rich a teaspoon of fish sauce and then a touch of chili leave the seeds in again i want the heat in that sauce so impressive an amazing show off center piece lime juice in in the coriander chop it through once give that little mix up just check the seasoning that's lovely nice and rich now the lettuce i'm going to use baby gem because it's really nice and durable and sort of quite strong so you just sort of sit these nice trimmed lettuce leaves around now the exciting part to serve take your lettuce up spoon in your mince and then a little touch of dressing just a little drizzle nice and that's the secret of having good easy relaxed food is that you just help yourself food that looks and tastes a million bucks doesn't have to be complex this dish is as fun to cook as it is to eat [Music] my next easy recipe is a miniature version of an american favorite the burger smokey pork sliders with barbecue sauce everyone loves a burger they're a true fast food original and that's the exciting thing about street food you can take an old classic like that and reinvent it into something really exciting when you think of a burger what you need is a great sauce an unlike smoky barbecue goes hand in glove with a great burger start by finely chopping one onion and three cloves of garlic nice hot pan tablespoon of olive oil onions and garlic into the pan nice seasoning salt and pepper now the secret of a good barbecue sauce is that really important caramelization to begin with a nice tablespoon of brown sugar it darkens the onions but it really starts to sort of give that nice syrupy body to the sauce i put a little bit of heat in there now a nice teaspoon of smoked paprika that's the important part of working with spices you got to cook them out and almost sort of burn off that rawness especially with a smoked paprika that's exactly where i want it to go onions and garlic beautifully caramelized cider vinegar in reduce that down now i've got a fantastic smoky base to complete the sauce i'm making my life really easy and adding pre-made worcester sauce and tomato ketchup cook that out for two to three minutes now depending on how thick you like the barbecue sauce that determines how long you cook it out for i don't want it to be too runny but i don't want it too thick either that's the consistency we're looking for lovely turn down the gas chapter seasoning now take that out it's the kind of sauce that i like to have sort of bottled up in the fridge it's great for sandwiches but goes brilliantly well with these sliders homemade smoky barbecue sauce [Music] give the pan a little wipe now start the mix for the sliders to give my mix a really interesting flavor and texture i'm gonna be using unsmoked back bacon i travel all over the world and i spend a lot of time in the states they know how to make a great slider pork sliders beef sliders chicken sliders it's almost like a way of having a burger but on a much smaller miniature level a little teaspoon of olive oil i want that bacon to get really nice and crispy bacon in this just gives the really nice sort of chunky delicious mix i want texture and pork is perfect for a slider [Music] and choppy shallot shallots are a lot sweeter than your normal white onion fine fine fine and then [Music] now that bacon's getting really nice and crispy i want a bit of heat in there put a little teaspoon of smoked paprika in there when you see these sliders in the states for one portion there's like four or five of them little mini one biters incredible now take your pork just open up and give that a really nice seasoning so important you can't season a slider after you've cooked it it's impossible so season it nicely bake now that's nice and crispy just take a little touch kitchen roll and just drain that off there nice pat that nice and dry i want all that nice sort of crispiness in there beautiful mix all that in take a nice ball and sort of roll it the size of a golf ball get it nice and round first and then three fingers just pat that down don't flatten them too thin otherwise they overcook and they go sort of dry because sliders are bite-sized burgers designed to go in small buns you don't want to make them too big good get the pan nice and hot a tablespoon of olive oil when a slider is literally that thick about an inch thick we're going to take two and a half to three minutes to each side in turn them over lovely once you've turned them tilt the pan and just spoon all that juice back into them keep my mouth watering now very easy to dry the pork out so just feeling it now your fingers is nice and firm it's a little touch of springiness in the center i'm happy with those add your cheese now so it gets nicely melted i'm using wedgies of smoked cheddar and it has that nice sort of soury smoky creaminess to the slider finally shredded baby gem lettuce just take those buns make sure they're sliced nice and evenly take your lettuce be quite generous with the lettuce just a nice thin slice of tomato take your burgers you see that cheese melted your bbq sauce place the top on and that is my version of a slider that is small dynamic but packed full of flavor i'll take that over a hamburger any day beef tacos with wasabi mayo the great thing about street food is anything goes the only rule is they've got to be really fast and really tasty now these tacos mix a mexican and japanese flavours into a delicious meaty mouthful first off get that pan really nice and hot these are sirloin steaks sear it in the pan with all that fat on i'll add flavor salt and pepper couple tablespoons of olive oil in pan nice and hot hold up the steak and lay it in always lay away give the pan a little shake and it stops the steak from sticking we're looking for color and if it sticks it's gonna burn while the steaks are cooking i can get on with my super quick marinade now two tablespoons of misood paste that's a fermented soybean that gives a really nice sort of rich sweetness tablespoon of sugar a couple of tablespoons rice wine that gives it a really nice vinegary kick a couple of tablespoons of olive oil salt and pepper i'm looking for a nice sort of thick rich marinade marinade done it's time to turn the steaks sort the pan and to give the steaks a little baste all we're doing every time is just adding more and more flavor take your tongs and sort of lift the steak on its back and really melt all that fat down off of the gas take them out just take your knife see all that fat there just slice that off i don't want any of that now in to the marinade [Music] beautiful tacos are one of mexico's most popular street foods they've been made from beef pork chicken or fish and are loaded up with amazing sauces and spices now i want something sort of pickly cabbage these are um chinese cabbages slice it in half look at it really crisp and really tasty we're gonna slice that into quarters and then just shred it and take your time think of cabbage here and you think of sort of braised overcooked cabbage nothing worse but at a taco you want freshness a little season of chili flakes they sort of discreetly give it a little bit of heat a little touch of rice wine vinegar if you haven't got that fresh lemon juice a small drop of toasted sesame seed oil give that a really good mix now i need something to sort of bring it together we take some wasabi paste very hot very spicy a sort of thumbnail size i'm gonna mix that with a couple of tablespoons of mayonnaise and give that a really good mix these are basic corn tortilla the trick is to sort of color them and then shape them actually place it on the gas ring use some tongs so it's not to burn yourself you can also toast your tacos in a frying pan from there i'm just gonna place it on the rolling pin literally 30 seconds as it cools down the great thing about serving tacos is people can fill them themselves just the way they want them cabbage just squeeze out wet marinade a nice rustic little mountain mayonnaise on wait you see how soft and delicious and almost sort of melting in the mouth texture we've got on this amazing sirloin look at that really nice sear around the outside it's just nice and pink in the middle start off with my crispy shell back of the spoon with the wasabi mayonnaise inside taco and just sprinkle that delicious pickled cabbage and then just start lining my taco three or four slices a touch more on my spicy layer and that is how i'd make the perfect taco [Music] you

everything from how to cook on a budget to baking real fast food and my ultimate feast recipes this is the only cookery course you'll ever need welcome to my ultimate cookery course packed with cooking tips information and 100 recipes to stake your life on right this is my guide to cooking with spice adding big gutsy flavors using spices at the beginning of cooking and then simply letting the dish slow cook is a brilliant way of getting maximum flavor with minimal effort my first recipe melts in the mouth and because the oven does most of the work it's a cinch to make slow cooked fiery lamb cooking's all about being bold and adventurous and this dish is exciting because it's slowly cooked and the longer it cooks the more flavoursome it becomes marinating the lamb first chilis we're going to use a mixture of red and green take off the tops and just slice in garlic crushed don't worry about chopping these ultra fine just get it in there cooking for up to three hours everything sort of blends and almost sort of purees itself together smoked paprika goes brilliantly well with the chilis two teaspoons in a touch of dried oregano some little cumin seeds the blend and the fragrance that they give out is extraordinary they release a little oil as well and helps to tenderize the lamb a touch of salt pepper cinnamon that sort of sweetens up the lamb olive oil just a tablespoon and the olive oil helps to sort of stick all those wonderful spices to the lamb jump in just start really rubbing at this stage you can leave the lamb to marinade for anything from half an hour to overnight allowing the spices to really penetrate the meat giving amazing results when you tuck in delicious vegetables carrots and onions and that's it sliced secret slicing vegetables for braising is not getting too thin you slice the onions too thin they burn you've got that horrible char taste on that slow braised braising it's just a chef's term that means cooking in liquid on a low heat making the meat incredibly moist and beautifully tender so the secret of braising is having a really nice thick durable pan get that nice and hot just a touch of olive oil lamb in hold the bone because you're in control then into the pan i want that white fat to start rendering so it'll add more fat therefore making it a lot more flavoursome as it braises chilies cinnamon in mix that up and don't be scared you're not burning this you're sort of searing the lamb shanks and this is the important part right at the very beginning we're going to the collar on the lamb which washes off as it braises in the oven so be generous with that color vegetables in wow and then a couple of baileys so now you lift the lamb up and get the lamb sat on top of the vegetables now just glaze the pan with red wine the glazing means that you're you're cleaning the bottom of the pan and you're getting that amazing flavor washed off and lifted up into that sauce can really transform that dish always delays then bring to the boil and cook for about 10 minutes to reduce the wine's reduced down by half now for the stock bring that stock back up to the ball and then into the oven now don't cover it when you cover it all the condensation comes off the lid your lamb becomes gray all this effort and that exciting spice gets washed away no lid and in the oven for three hours a slow cook on a low heat of 160 degrees gives the spices time to work and transform the meat so it's mouthwateringly tender now look at those out on to a plate you can just see that meat sliding down juicy and incredibly tender grab it by the the shank rolling around that rich delicious sauce look at that and get your sauce nice beautiful just get some mint don't chop it just pick that fresh mint and let it snow and there you go a very spicy delicious melting of the mouth lamb shank amazing to get the most out of your spices there's only one piece of kit that you need pestle and water i mean they look fantastic and it's essential for any good kitchen these things are so versatile these ancient kitchen tools are perfect for everything from pestos to dressings and cost them around 15 quid use the grind spices

are the more confidence it gives you when you're pounding and there's almost a way of confirming homemade hand pounded grab yourself a pestle and mortar and soon you'll be spicing with ease spices are

packs an amazingly aromatic punch three more stunning recipes that make cooking with spice simple incredible [Music] this is my guide to cooking with spice next up my shopping guide to buying spices [Music] when i buy my spice i only want the best and it always pays to get expert advice berget aerith has been selling every spice under the sun in london's not a hill for over 20 years so she really knows what she's talking about i love spices the smell the texture the color spices are so versatile something very very simple can be really transformed into something really delicious with thousands of aromatic ingredients on her shelves if it smells good she sells it if you buy spices buy them whole then you can try roast them grind them when you need them and then they will release the essential oils whole spices you can keep for years give them a good bashing wine bottle with your rolling pin or whatever and you see there is still aroma and you can taste it you smell it then it's fine there's four main spices one is sweet one is sour one is bitter and one is hot this is cinnamon and that is really a great example of a sweet spice when you buy a cinnamon quill like this you have to check that you have loads of different layers in here then you can either grind this or you'd break a piece off i mean this doesn't smell of anything now but if you roll it in your hand just quickly like this and then you smell it again this is just unbelievable if you have spaghetti bolognese put a pinch of cinnamon in it to bring out the flavor so monk this is one of those really special spices sour like a lemon but it has a salty aftertaste i use this anywhere from marinades to salad you haven't lived unless you tried it a great example for a bitter spice would actually be a turmeric this is actually a root it grows in the ground like ginger use it very very sparingly about that much will actually color you a curry or rice dish wonderful yellow watch your fingers you get really yellow fingers from it and then we come to the hot spices one spice that i couldn't miss and that is hungarian paprika paprika is the powdery form of a bell pepper what makes the hungarian paprika different is that they actually crowd in vineyards it's sort of between the vines it has a sweetness and it has a sharpness to it i have it in ice cream i have it on fish i have it everywhere burger spot on about the power of spices to transform dishes whether savory or sweet here's my quick guide to the spices i use most black pepper this is the spice i couldn't do without always buy a whole and grind yourself so you get the freshest flavor cardamom these pods come in green or black types and have a fantastic spicy sweet taste brilliant for everything from curries to rice dishes and puddings coriander these citrusy seeds are perfect hole in pickles or grind to use in fragrance stews and soups cumin a savory spice that's pungent and nutty it's great in marinades for delicious meat and fish then cinnamon sweetly fragrant and great with apples or in cakes and nutmeg warm and spicy it's delicious and a vegetable sauce finely saffron these sweet strands infuse a brilliant bright red color and are great in risottos and even though it's more expensive than gold a pinch goes a long long way store your spices properly and they'll last for years you keep it airtight in a tin or in a glass jar in your cupboard don't be scared of spices like an aftershave or perfume you have to select it yourself it has to fit in with your taste and with your kitchen supermarkets and good local shops sell an amazing array of different spices so there's no excuse for not being adventurous be bold find what you like and spice up your cooking like all chefs i love the challenge of transforming classic recipes giving them a new twist to make them modern and vibrant to keep old dishes fresh and exciting it's great to get spicy my next recipe is a time-honored british classic but with addition of spices it's given a new lease of life fragrant spiced rice pudding i love cooking with spices but you don't have to just cook savory dishes using aromatics and spices across desserts takes your puddings to a completely different level [Music] first off our spices this is a fresh banana pot fragrant and packed full of flavour use the back of the knife and flatten it that removes all those little seeds off the skin of the vanilla pod take your knife slice down the middle and then when you open that up the smell is incredible take the tip of the knife and you scrape inside and look all those seeds dying to come out that is incredible there are thousands of seeds still ingrained to the pod so put them in to the casserole cardamom powerful spicy take two little pods place your knife on top lightly crack them cracking the cardamom pods helps release all the amazing flavor cloves gives it that kind of aniseed flavor with a lot of depth one two three cinnamon stick snap and in just smelling that level of fragrance you can imagine what the rice pudding is gonna taste of turn on the heat lightly toast those spices just a couple of seconds now what's gonna happen is just gonna sort of enhance those spices in a way that it just draws out an even more powerful fragrance coconut milk in sugar two tablespoons milk and then a couple of tablespoons of cream bring it slowly to the boil to allow the flavours to infuse and this rice pudding reminds me of my time in india where i got really into that chai tea fragrance because it was just so delicious and so comforting take a lime in the lime just cuts through the richness of the coconut gives it that nice little bit of acidity goes fantastically well with the cinnamon and that fresh vanilla nice have a taste now let's come up to the boil give it a nice little clean around the outside and in with the rice use 200 grams of pudding rice don't wash it beforehand because the starch helps thicken the rice pudding in the oven and just turn that down to a light simmer and the pudding rice starts to open up and it absorbs all that coconut vanilla cardamom clove and cinnamon bring up to the ball gently and cook it out three to five minutes boiling it rapidly the rice opens up and it goes into mush we want to keep that nice texture that sort of fragrant rice pudding on a gentle simmer next a little luxury i want to show you how i take this simple delicious aromatic rice pudding to a completely different level here's what i do take two egg yolks separate them now give that a really nice whisk two nice tablespoons of mascarpone cheese whisk that into the egg yolks just so it's nice and smooth it's almost like finishing the rice pudding in a delicious custard turn off the gas add that into the rice pudding what happens it starts to enrich and really thicken this rice pudding and takes it to a completely different level the rice is still not cooked it's starting to go nice and soft you can just see how it's opening up but looks like rich aromatic lava bubbling away finally great more citrus zest the lime on top roasted caramelized lime zest on top of a rice pudding is phenomenal then put it in the oven for 15 minutes at 200 degrees to finish cooking the rice and develop the intensely aromatic flavors look at that an incredibly fragrant rice pudding how beautiful does that look spices are a brilliant way of helping classic dishes come alive i'll guarantee you'll never ever have had a rice pudding like this before next my tricks of the trade and kitchen tips first how to zest the lemon the important part is not to zest any of the pith watch the following technique and i'll show you how we've got these original graters really important when we use this we use the the fine zester not the big rough one not the one for slicing and not the other one for grating this little one here onto a plate because it's always easier to lift off from the plate than it is of the board and the most important thing about zesting a lemon is nice long strokes but twisting the lemon round every time we go down we twist same with the orange and same with the lime little tap if you go too far let me just show you look you got that white bitter piff that destroys the wonderful zesty flavor and look that's what we're looking for there this really nice vibrant lemon zest delicious garlic is a key ingredient in so many spicy dishes my tip for finally chopping a mincing is add a pinch of salt for abrasion which helps break the fibers of the garlic down for a much better result for getting the most out of root ginger simply remove the skin using a teaspoon it's easier than using a knife and you can get around the tricky bits or just keep the skin on and give it a good wash never throw out vanilla pods there's a ton of flavor left in the skin stick inside jars of sugar and leave to infuse great to sprinkle on cakes biscuits or porridge when grinding up spices if you have any leftover you can store in an airtight jar for up to two months great for a spicy kick to have at your fingertips follow my ultimate cookery course crammed with key lessons top tips and 100 recipes to stake

we're gonna make a really nice light sweet chili sauce first off your chili off with the top in half and those seeds inside are very powerful incredibly hot but full of flavor garlic two cloves of garlic slice the garlic nice and thin so it helps to puree the chilies in the pest and water garlic in such a salt a little touch of sugar in and then start grinding push down first [Music] the salt and the sugar really helps to puree the chili and the garlic fish sauce always a base to a chili sauce two tablespoons in and a touch of rice wine vinegar fish sauce gives it the saltiness the vinegar gives it a nice acidic wake up three tablespoons of olive oil nice mix that up beautiful look at it the colors incredible now spring onions i want the texture and the crunch spring onions in the coriander slice it once in fresh lime and that goes brilliantly with a red mullet just really wakes up the chili the garlic and reminds the sauce that we're serving with fish now taste wow that's delicious look at that beautiful the longer that chili sauce sits there the better it gets now for the peanuts and chili that's going to coat the top of the red mullet peanuts in salt in that helps to

when cooking just a little bit of coriander mix the coriander in to the peanuts and look i like them quite textured i don't want them too small as a powder otherwise they'll burn but crushed lightly to coat the fish with the chili and peanut seasoning in a separate bowl beat two eggs along with a splash of fish sauce take your fillet lay in your red mullet dip it in shake up your peanuts and then in and make sure you push that down cover that red mullet up beautiful now make sure that pan is really nice and piping on if you put the fish in and the pan's cold all those wonderful peanuts and chilli just gonna slide off the fish so we need to sear it in and get it nice and crisp in and lay away from you beautiful [Music] if the pan starts getting a little bit too hot get your olive oil and just place another teaspoon of olive oil around the outside so it starts to heat up as it hits the center and it really helps to stay so much more in control and turn nice and gently we want that nice sort of toasted sauteed crispness which adds a really lovely flavor tilt the pan and just baste the top of the red mullet with that really nice piping hot olive oil you've got that really nice roasted crunch and it goes brilliantly with that soft sweetness of that fish inside get off and just leave them sitting in there and finish with lime and just go over each one now we'll take them out and the

make your life easier in the kitchen first up how to de-seed chili to get the seeds out hold it upright and just rub the chili between your hands the seeds are incredibly hot you're just releasing them from the inside tapping it down and then again just a final little rub now cut the top off and then just open up and look they come out like little miniature smarties from there cut the little bottom bit off amazing next a great tip for using spare chilis using string tie together the stalks then simply hang in your kitchen in just a few weeks you'll get your very own dried chilies great crumbled into dishes for adding heat on demand chilies are surprisingly versatile if you love them in savory dishes my tip is to try adding them to melty chocolate ganache for chocolate chili truffles or sprinkled over fresh fruit like mango or watermelon a great tip to prevent burning sensitive skin when working with chilies to get rid of that spice and that heat on your fingers a little bit of lemon squeeze a little bit of lemon juice and that instantly gets rid of the heat fresh lemon juice spice up your drinks for a mexican twist add a dash of hot chili sauce to beer or using cocktails to give your drink a very different sort of kick this is my ultimate cookery course 100 recipes to stake your life on i'll be showing you an amazing spicy beef salad take a little teaspoon of your dressing and just go over the beef but first the secret to cooking fantastic food is to start with great ingredients the more you know personally about where your ingredients are from and how they produce the better so don't be scared ask lots of questions and learn and when it comes to chilis there's no one better to ask than chili grower joanna plum who's been farming chili's from mild to mind-blown for over 11 years i eat chilies all the time every single day she grows over 60 types on her farm and really knows her poblanos from a habaneros people think that chili's are all about heat actually it's about flavor as well some are sweet some are aromatic and they can be used in so many different dishes when you go shopping and you're looking for a chili what should you be looking for what you want to do is look at the chili and it needs to be nice and firm and glossy generally the bigger the chili the milder it's going to be the smaller the chilli the hotter and if it's small and wrinkly like this one it's going to blow your socks off another way to tell if a chilli is hot or not is to split it open and smell it if it's a super hot chili it'll clear your sinuses the heat of a chili comes from an oil called capsaicin and that is concentrated mainly at the top of the chili where the seeds are now when you're cooking with a chili and you want the flavour of the chili but not too much of the heat start with just using the bottom of it as you get closer to the seeds that chili's going to get hotter so if you remove the seeds that also does remove some of the heat there's thousands of varieties out there because they cross pollinate very very easily and that's why the world's hottest chili is always changing joanna's right with over 200 types available all with different flavors aromas and of course levels of heat it's important to buy what you like here are my top chilis whatever your desired kick at the mild end poblano these are great for stuffing have a delicate flavor and often used in mexican dishes starting to get hot the jalapeno when they're green they're like spicy bell pepper the redder they are the sweeter they are bird's eye where they really start to pack a punch long thin and pungent they're great in thai dishes and are often green or red and at the top end the habanero these lantern shaped demons have a delicious fruity taste and they're the firecracker of the chili world another way to use chilies is to smoke them and to make chipotle what it is it's just a mesquite smoked red jalapeno it smells fantastic you can almost get that like smoky bacon sort of flavor out of it so you would use this in anything that you would slow cook so you're eating a chili and it's really too hot for you the best way to get rid of that heat is to drink some milk or a dairy product like yoghurt whatever you do don't go for water or for beer don't be frightened of trying new types of chilies in your cooking experimenting with these amazing fiery beasts is a great excuse for getting hot-headed in the kitchen they give you a natural high much like when you've been exercising so your endorphins are released and you just feel good chilies make you happy and they're also an aphrodisiac [Music] southeast asian chefs they're brilliant at balancing the hot spices of chili with sweet sour and salty flavors if you want a new twist on a favorite dish spice it up with chili my next recipe is super simple to make but has wonderful depth and complexity of flavors spicy beef salad chilies if you use them confidently they can really add a new dimension to the style of cooking but the real trick is finding that balance of flavors that really suits you because that's the most important part so this is the most amazing sirloin you can see it's got that wonderful marble for me the secret behind this is cooking it quickly season the steaks generously salt and pepper push that seasoning in to the sirloin take the soda out the fridge literally 20 minutes before you want to cook them so it gets up to room temperature they cook more evenly but more importantly you can actually season right inside the steak this little bit of fat down here season that as well because that is what we want to roast and get that really nice and rendered olive oil in a tablespoon roll that round as it starts to smoke in with the steaks into the pan and lay away again into the pan and lay away if you don't hear that noise the minute those steaks hit the pan don't put them in so the secret now is getting that color on the steak turning it once and once only and cooking it for two and a half minutes each side what i want to do is to get that bit of fat rendered so it adds a lot more flavor just hold the steak down like that and that starts to melt the fat which makes it so much more tender there should be no white fat left anywhere turn them over really important to have that steak up to room temperature before you start cooking it so the inside is nice and warm so we spend less time in the pan and more time cooling down really important now two fingers touch it goes in says rare i'm happy for them to be rare because by the time i let them rest they're going to go back to medium rare it'll continue cooking out onto a plate and let them rest one to just get my juices over don't waste that really important next the spicy dressing take the seeds out of the chili to reduce the heat by rubbing it in your hands and tapping until the seeds fall out cut it in half and just chop it in garlic and chilli works brilliantly a quick way of peeling it get your knife and just slam it down pops out very very quickly in a little touch of salt rub start going around in circles first you'll see it puring nice clear that off now we've got the heat in there from the chilli and that richness from the garlic two teaspoons of palm sugar this is where it starts to have that nice sweet sour effect fish sauce fresh lime this is a simple fresh chili dressing and it was something i fell in love with in vietnam and cambodia because it was just so easy give that a little mix and dissolve the sugar quick taste wow right vegetables a great fuss-free way to get super thin ribbons of carrot is to use a veg peeler when they're that thin they take the vinaigrette so much better and radishes just slice them down at an angle lovely to give another dimension to the salad i'm gonna use a banana shallot they are incredibly mellow very sweet across just chop up the shallot and mix that through want some sweetness in there now little vine tomatoes slice them in half smarter's in shallot radish carrots and tomatoes next peel and slice cucumber chopped spring onions and shred baby gem lettuce and then finally get some fresh mint there's young men so you don't need to take all those stalks off all you do is hold the bunch upside down and then take it for a little trim and just chop that once through look at that nice minted salad a couple of tablespoons of dressing don't flood the salad with a dressing you can always add but we can't take it away now really mix that dressing in there make sure all that chili and garlic and palm sugar wraps around that salad beautiful onto the plate the steaks rested it's now nice and medium rare that little bit of fat we don't want to find that in the salad just slice that off that serves its purpose it's kept that steak nice and moist just slice going with the grain it's almost like slicing through butter and look inside beautiful pink you slice the beef too thinly then it goes stone cold and more importantly all the goodness runs out of it nice thick slices get the beef and start placing it around the salad take a little teaspoon of your dressing the rest of your salad sit there on top and finish it off with some toasted peanuts peanuts in now those nuts are really toasted nuts on get another pan and just crush once they've cooled down just run them through with a knife they can hear how crunchy they are another texture another taste the salad and then from there sprinkle and then finally take that just finish it with a little tablespoon of that sauce and there is one tasty very well textured spicy beef salad [Music] follow my ultimate cookery course crammed with key lessons top tips and 100 recipes to stake your life on and you'll literally be cooking yourself

Pre-order...",2022-11-29 22:16:02.926159, i've just arrived in india's capital delhi on the first leg of my great escape morning how are you are you well good to see you oh my god it's so hard is that the air conditioning [Music] i want to discover the truth about curry i know our uk version is nothing like the real thing so i want to learn how indian food should be made 99 of the food in the uk regarding the curries are all from north india delhi i don't know if what we're doing the uk is an insult to what they do over here i'm not complete with the level of indian food that i know delhi is the eighth largest metropolis in the world with 17 million residents my issue is are we doing it wrong are we faking it and delhi is going to give me my answer so my mission in northern india is a personal culinary voyage of discovery [Music] all the classics such as rogue and josh biryani and butter chicken come from here [Music] in the 19th century workers in the british raj acquired a taste for curry creating a demand for it upon the returns of britain and we've been in love with indian food ever since india is a big mystery to me it's like the wacky races unbelievable i've never been to india before and i have to say it's quite a shock to the system i mean this is extraordinary i mean kids everywhere people actually living on the street i need a bit of guidance i'm on my way to meet someone who can help at one of india's most famous restaurants the moti mahal it's here uk favorites such as tandoori chicken were invented sima chandra is an expert on the food of northern india and she's helping me with my travel itinerary hi hello how are you very well good to see you see my chandra ah nice welcome to india very happy to be here she's one of india's most respected food writers and restaurant critics why have you brought me here well the reason i got you here is that this place is where most of indian food the way it's known the world over yeah they all began here i love milk mahoney the dal chicken tikka makhani as in butter chicken yes well butter chicken started right here 60 years ago seriously is there a difference between what they're serving here to what we're serving in the uk it is nothing close what you're going to get i mean i was shocked that they even call it indian food in fact i have a problem with it it's not indian cream and they put sugar into everything yeah and they think okay that's it that's done it's not indian food shall we order so we'd like butter chicken of course butter chicken tandoori chicken so you're more convinced that i'm going to taste a big difference to what i'm about to eat out and out thank you okay yeah thank you are you going to eat with your with a knife in front will you tell me you can't get the flavor of indian food with a knife and fork no i should try that back at home it's glass famous it's blasphemous what do you think it's absolutely delicious and it's not um it's not dry it's moist it's moist here that's the dish you've been waiting for so the butter chicken this is it bloody hell it is nothing gives me more pleasure than seeing someone neat and saying bloody hell how does this compare with what you have i mean that already honestly seymour it's chalk and cheese it's very flavoursome yeah and there's no it doesn't taste taint tartare jelly it's not like it's been laced with tomato puree not at all fresh tomatoes i think a working holiday will show me the real india i need to go native if i'm truly to discover how our uk flavors should be cooked i'm not here to watch no i would like i want to cook that's it okay now the thing is not stay away from the touristy traps quite the contrary go into the remote areas right go into people's homes go into the desert the best food is in these little little areas it's not in fancy places go for the humble go for the humble get to know what does this do why is this yellow why is this brown why is this little thing looking like moss i think it's really important for gordon to understand what we indians eat every day a regular sort of food i'm being apprenticed under a chef famous for his intricate dishes and infamous for his lack of patience sounds like my kind of man that's the kitchen [Music] hey how are you good to see you are you well you're very well good excited to be here yeah hi we were just expecting you everything oh well i got here early yeah how are you fight good to see you okay excellent head chef imtiaz qureshi was born into the dynasty of bowaches his five sons including irfan my translator are all chefs too 79 years old he's 79 today he's got a handshake like a 25 year old in england they call you king korma yes in england this man's reputation is called the dog's bollocks yeah the dog's nuts number one yes definitely gonna explain him how old's your father my father is around 1848 84. it's gone up in the last five minutes that's amazing so what's the first thing we're gonna do for today the first we'll do the the marination of dumba biryani okay in the uk the biryani is often a bland dish stodgy rice with frozen veg and a tasteless sauce but it's soon clear the complex dumber biryani is going to be nothing like the dole uk version i would really enjoy if i could do it that's what i'm trying to tell him like you just give it to him he's like me a control freak this is uh videga yes i've never seen two whole goats in a biryani before first i'm tenderizing them with vinegar then they'll be stuffed with chickens quails and eggs and served on a bed of fragrant rice okay okay yeah okay oh out jesus thank you okay now we're coating the goats in ginger and chili you just five five okay like that mtr's makes it clear that great indian cookery is instinctive there's no recipe as such you know what he's trying to say whenever the new student comes and you try to learn so you should respect the the teacher you know i definitely respect the teacher trust me he looks like kind of guy i don't want to fall out with okay in terms of technique this dish is as complex as anything in michelin style cookery i'm now marinating the chicken and the quails in the chili ginger garlic and yogurt mix what is a basic takeaway in britain is a finely tuned feasting dish in india back in the uk every curry house 99 of them use the same base for the sauce here it's completely different individual curry individual sauce there's no same base it's all becoming so much clearer [Music] enough yeah i think it's perfectly okay what's the largest wedding your father's ever cooked [Music] uh he's saying almost fifty thousand to one lakh equalized and uh fifty thousand oh my god oh my god people from all over the world from president to and minister to they always cater to everyone empty ours has got a bigger head than me but i would love to have the chance to work for him you know when he was a rottweiler under the age of 35. yeah but look at the hands they're like shovels look oh my god amazing amazing amazing mate 84 as strong as an ox his father was almost 135 years old his father was 135 years old yeah jesus the one thing into interiors isn't bullshitting about is the food the hard-boiled eggs are coated in saffron egg inside the quail i haven't had a master class like this since my tommy chef days in paris that way jesus the eggs go inside the quail the quail inside the chicken and finally we stuff it all in the goats it's almost like sort of rewinding giving birth yeah you're putting it back in once it's been born we're going to stitch it wow it was a dish that was put together for why right this this dish was made for only for a king don't light it down just make him stand i'll stand them up very good this show beats a supermarket curry ready meal the goats have been left to cook for three hours old boy empty house he's a he's a legend no one knows his age but he's a hard ass trust me you don't want to mess with him more importantly he doesn't speak a word of english but we're communicating through the food taste understanding but what a technical genius way of putting together a goat biryani the final stage is the rice for the biryani first we clean and part ball basmati rice so the rice is cooked with a bag of sort of aromatic spices so it's like a bokeh garlic [Music] now i'm learning the technique known as dumb cooking the rice is placed in a special pan and saffron is added then the pan is sealed with pastry and the rice is left to steam but one small mistake can mean disaster know saffron time to put on the pastry seal but it's not happening quick enough for emptiers what's wrong [Laughter] huh in situations like this you keep your mouth shut and finish the job quickly the whole style behind dumbbell cooking is keeping all the flavors locked in so sealing with the pastry on the outside is that little sort of work of magic so how long for that now i think it will take uh 25 minutes we've been cooking all day and the first guests are starting to arrive time to assemble adam biryani [Music] you gonna pick this yeah [Music] the biryani is finished with spicy indian meatballs called kofta coriander and dried apricot amazing ask him for the first time this morning is he happy with it good excellent at the beginning i felt like a bit of a spare prick at a wedding 10 minutes into it he made me feel like a chef thank that's you delicious refined wine if he was living in britain for the last 84 years would have a completely different take on indian food you know that i don't know i swear to god it's delicious authentic and amazing

perfectly now start off with 400 grams of rice rice in spot on so what i'm going to do now is just rinse off the dust and the starch cold water always and just rinse the rice that stops the rice from becoming clumpy in the pan and allows it to become really nice light and fluffy once it's cooked rice into the pan now to make a plain fluffy rice exciting we're going to infuse it three cardamom pods and just get the pods and just pierce them so it allows all that flavor to come out cardamom pods and then star anise now these are beautiful whole star anise it makes it really nice and fragrant salt and pepper a lot easier to season the rice now than it is once it's cooked you start to break it up when you season once it's cooked now it's basically one part rice to one and a half part water 600 mils always start off in cold water cold water in onto the gas lid on bring it up to the ball as quick as possible and turn it down and let it simmer for 8 to 10 minutes and that's the secret behind cooking great rice allow it to steam as it's cooking do not lift that lid up lid off [Music] it smells aromatic basically all the water's absorbed the rice has doubled in size and is nice and light and fluffy take the staranise out the cardamom pods they all should have risen to the top pods out take your fork fluff it through basically just sort of starts to open everything back up once you've forked it through it becomes really nice and light and fluffy and there that is perfectly cooked rice always make the most of your leftovers use last night's rice in stir fries scrambled up with eggs or it's simple to make a delicious fresh salad remember a good cook waste nothing spicy sausage rice whatever you're cooking the secret to making great food is to ensure you're locking every last ounce of flavour in that pan and this spicy sausage rice does exactly that [Music] take these spicy sausages and pierce that skin because i want all that delicious spicy sausage meat out of this casing and you get more flavor from the sausage when you take them out the casing sausage is ready turn on the gas bread onion less acidic than a big white spanish onion and a lot more flavoursome tablespoon of olive oil a tablespoon only because i want all that fat coming out the sausages to sort of really help flavor the onions onions in and the onions go in first because you can never rush cooking an onion it's really important to sort of give them five to six minutes in the pan so you can really start to caramelize them my mouth and my pepper slice around wasting nothing i want to see that sort of little core those pips in the center no fine diced pepper the rice is going to be cooking for 20 minutes so i want the veg to sort of have texture after it's cooked peppers in a bit of garlic two nice cloves just slap down off with the shell garlic in now i want to turn up the gas get the pan nice and hot because the minute that sausage goes in everything cools down and you'll end up boiling the peppers and the onions and the garlic so heat up to maximum and then just make a well in the center in now start stirring quickly this is where you get so much more bang for your buck out of sausages because the skins off and the real flavor of that spicy italian sausage is going to come through what's great about this recipe is that you can use any type of sausage to get the flavor and the heat you want i've gone for the spicy italian but it's just as good with murgues or chorizo a teaspoon paprika in give it that really nice smoky flavor rice in and we're going to sort of basically sear the rice we call it in the kitchen blasting the rice where we sort of sorted the rice for 30 seconds and it takes on all that flavor next white wine so the wine sort of deglazes the pan and washes all that flavor from the bottom of the pan into the rice stock in bring it up to the boil turn it down and let it simmer [Music] double stop to rice turn that gas down and let it simmer so 12 to 15 minutes and just give it the occasional stir keep an eye on it now get ready to finish it slice spring onions diced sweet juicy tomatoes and roughly chop earthy flat leaf parsley spring is in tomatoes in off with the gas really important otherwise everything becomes overcooked flat leaf parsley in but look at the volume in that pan now that is an amazing way to take spicy italian sausages to a completely different level beautiful [Music] starting with my easy fragrant fried rice first get prepped chopped garlic ginger and chili keeping the seeds for extra kick slice spring onions chopped spring greens and trim ahead of broccoli then whisk two eggs prep done stir fry on add a good lug of oil to a hot pan garlic ginger chili next the spring greens and broccoli add water to steam [Music] then cook rice this dish is perfect for using leftover rice make a well add the eggs spring onions and a dash of fish sauce scramble then mix season [Applause] top with lime and spring onions fragrant spiced rice pudding i love cooking with spices but you don't have to just cook savory dishes using aromatics and spices across desserts takes your puddings to a completely different level [Music] first off our spices this is a fresh vanilla pod fragrant and packed full of flavor use the back of the knife and flatten it that removes all those little seeds off the skin of the vanilla pod take your knife slice down the middle and then when you open that up the smell is incredible take the tip of the knife and you scrape inside and look all those seeds dying to come out that is incredible there are thousands of seeds still ingrained to the pod so put them in to the casserole cardamom powerful spicy take two little pods place your knife on top and lightly crack them cracking the cardamom pods helps release all the amazing flavour cloves gives it that kind of aniseed flavor with a lot of depth one two three cinnamon stick snap and in [Music] just smelling that level of fragrance you can imagine what the rice pudding's gonna taste of turn on the heat lightly toast those spices just a couple of seconds and what's going to happen is just going to sort of enhance those spices in a way that it just draws out an even more powerful fragrance coconut milk in sugar two tablespoons milk and then a couple of tablespoons of cream bring it slowly to the boil to allow the flavours to infuse and this rice pudding reminds me of my time in india where i got really into that chai tea fragrance because it was just so delicious and so comforting take a lime in the lime just cuts through the richness of the coconut gives it that nice little bit of acidity goes fantastically well with the cinnamon and that fresh vanilla nice have a taste now let's come up to the boil give it a nice little clean around the outside and in with the rice use 200 grams of pudding rice don't wash it beforehand because the starch helps thicken the rice pudding in the oven and just turn that down to a light simmer and the pudding rice starts to open up and it absorbs all that coconut vanilla cardamom clove and cinnamon bring up to the ball gently and cook it out three to five minutes boiling it rapidly the rice opens up and it goes into mush we want to keep that nice texture that sort of fragrant rice pudding on a gentle simmer next a little luxury i want to show you how i take this simple delicious aromatic rice pudding to a completely different level here's what i do take two egg yolks separate them now give that a really nice whisk two nice tablespoons of mascarpone cheese whisk that into the egg yolks just so it's nice and smooth it's almost like finishing the rice pudding in a delicious custard turn off the gas add that into the rice pudding what happens it starts to enrich and really thicken this rice pudding and takes it to a completely different level the rice is still not cooked it's starting to go nice and soft you can just see how it's opening up but looks like rich aromatic lava bubbling away finally great more citrus zest the lime on top roasted caramelized lime zest on top of a rice pudding is phenomenal then put it in the oven for 15 minutes at 200 degrees to finish cooking the rice and develop the intensely aromatic flavors look at that an incredibly fragrant rice pudding how beautiful is that look spices are a brilliant way of helping classic dishes come alive i'll guarantee you'll never ever have had a rice pudding like this before [Music] you

and i promise you'll find these three recipes a pleasure to make amazing [Music] you don't need to spend a fortune on masses of kitchen equipment this is my quick guide to kitchen knives basically three knives a heavy duty chopping knife followed by a small paring knife which is brilliant for prepping vegetables and then this baby here a serrated edge knife for carving and slicing basically that is it before you buy a knife hold it in your hand and make sure it feels right for you the secret behind a great set of knives is in the handle if you're comfortable holding the handle your cutting can be so much easier the firmer the grip the better the chopping the heavier the handle the more control you've got over the blade with these three knives you can't go wrong welcome back to my ultimate cookery course [Music] this is my guide to keeping it simple my next recipe is easy and a pleasure to make if you're organized with everything ready in advance [Music] miso poached salmon with asian vegetables organization is key in the kitchen take a couple of minutes before you start and set yourself up make sure you know where everything is stock spatula pan etc it becomes less stressful but more importantly the end results are incredible [Music] first off get your pan on whisk and stock start off with this amazing fermented soy bean puree into the pan three nice tablespoons gas on now get your fish stock and whisk into the puree be generous with the stock you want this nice light broth basically you can buy miso paste from big supermarkets and it works brilliantly with salmon poaching the salmon in the miso stuff gives it a really nice sort of sweet earthy creamy flavor it's incredible bring up to the bowl i'm going to infuse the broth and make it a little bit more fragrant kaffir lime leaf is very lemony inside the miso broth then chopped chili chili's in and finely sliced ginger that's simmering beautifully now we're gonna poach the salmon poaching means cooking it in liquid but it's cooked gently and the secret here is to keep that salmon skin on if we took the skin off now the salmon can actually break up whilst it's poaching skin side down i'm just going to slide that in under nice the minute that stock starts boiling turn it down let it simmer take a little ladle and just every couple of minutes pour over that makes sure the top of the salmon is cooked evenly and keeps it nice and moist and poaching is one of the most delicate ways of cooking so you have to handle it with care whilst the salmon's poaching in the miso broth start preparing your vegetables i'm using tender stem broccoli and bak choy i always like to cook the leaf and the stem separately the leaf is like sort of spinach and the stem is so much thicker it's almost as thick as a stick of celery so i like to get the stems sliced just so i've got that nice sort of christmas place the leaves together nicely roll them up nice and tight and then slice them down now my salmon already the flavor in that broth has been elevated now it tastes really fishy got the heat the chili spiciness the ginger and the caffeine lime leaf take your fish slice and place it very gently underneath the salmon and push it down fish slices are flexible for that reason bend it lift it up just touch looking for a springy firm texture and just sit there on top and it will touch the broth over it it stops it from drying out leave that to cool down for two minutes bring the stock back up to the boil broccoli and bak choy stems in a little taste it's getting better and better and better cook the broccoli and the bok choy stems for one minute and then add the tops in turn the salmon into your hand and just peel all that skin off the skin also helps to keep the salad nice and moist then gently flake the salmon that's the secret behind poaching everything just stays so moist wonderful long shards of pink now just before we serve we're going to add our mushrooms these are enoki mushrooms you can buy these enoki mushrooms in big supermarkets and good grocers slice them off i'm going to put half in and the other half i'm gonna serve with the salmon toasted sesame seed oil put a little drip in there just rub and you're just lining almost like a little coat of varnish start off with your mushrooms and then my salmon four nice layers and then finally the mushrooms top with the vegetables and then finally a nice ladle that beautiful really sumptuous rich stock lovely and that is an amazing misu poached salmon soup simplify your cooking by getting organized and amazing food will be coming out your kitchen every day and for great food you need great ingredients [Music] next up my shopping guide to getting the finest fish when i buy my fish i only want the freshest and the best and if anyone knows how to get the best it's roger kent barbara he's been buying and selling fish at the world famous billings gate market in london for over 50 years i love fish i think it's the greatest food of all time i sell literally every variety there is i could feed you a different fish 365 days a year this guy really knows how to sniff out the good from the bad all fish smell different the longer it's around the more fishy it will smell when it's lovely and fresh it doesn't smell whenever you're gonna buy fish don't be frightened get your nose right into it don't go like that get it into it smell it smells delightful it smells what i call salmony and it's lovely barramundi it's a lovely fish the way to tell good fish is look at it closely it's shining it's still got the bloom on it his eyes are as bright as yours look in the gill lovely and red put it in a bag for the gentleman please people should always be asking about their fish what kind of fish is it where does it come from a nice salmon 19 pound it's a bargain at 20 pounds roger's right salmon's brilliant value and a great all-rounder really healthy and super delicious here's a quick look at the different cuts and how to use them [Music] whole salmon always impresses it's fantastic stuffed and steamed either in a fish kettle or in the oven wrapped in foil steaks are great value and brilliant baked a cider salmon is perfect for poaching home curing or baking in pastry the fillet is so versatile easy fast to cook and great for pan frying smoked salmon delicious cooked or raw i love it with scrambled eggs [Music] broadly there's white fish and there's oily fish they come under two different sections here we have white fish it's lovely it's cold it's the best cot in the world it comes to a place called peterhead it's nice and white the whiter the better one of the most oily fish you'll find mackerel there it is lovely color with most fish the fresher they are the harder they are if you're not well and you're ill have a mackerel sprats otherwise known as top hats here we have flat fish and these are known as place as you can see they've got spots the redder they are the fresher they are it really is a lovely fish to eat king jules couldn't have better for fish fresh enough for royalty follow your fishmonger's advice and you'll never ever have another dodgy dover sole again [Music] next my tricks of the trade and kitchen tips first how to chop an onion this is the root that's absolutely crucial leave that on there if you cut that off the onion will start to bleed and you'll start crying rapidly slice going forward let the weight of the knife do the work three fingers one in front two behind and this part of the knuckle is going to guide the knife fingers on top of the onion point the knife towards the root and try to get as close to the root as possible nice long stroke and then push the onion back together push the knife halfway in to the onion slightly tilt the knife down one at the top and then gripping the onion like a tennis ball holding it together in place with the weight of the blade to cut through that onion to get to the base of the root again turn it round up and down motion and that's what we're left there no waste just the root and look there you've got a really nice finely chopped onion so much great cooking depends on starting with a high enough heat if a recipe calls for a hot pan put it on early so it gets smoking hot and always remember to preheat your oven at least 20 minutes before cooking clean cook is an efficient cook my tip for a tidy cooking area is to always have a waste bowl next to you it saves you going back and forth to the bin never add salt to eggs before cooking them because it ruins the texture and dulls the colour instead save your seasoning to the very end [Music] the key to cooking meat is to make sure it's at room temperature before you begin cook straight from the fridge the mussel fibers will be tight which results in tough meat and always let it rest afterwards so relax is becoming tender and juicy [Music] follow my ultimate cookery course crammed with key lessons top tips and 100 recipes to

olive oil in [Music] i'm going to saute them which is just the chef's turn for shallow frying on a high heat for maximum taste some salt and pepper add a tablespoon of sugar sugar helps to break down the peppers quicker but caramelize the onions frying them in a frying pan perfect it's one of the sort of basic essential tools of any kitchen because it's so multi-purpose great for sauteing tossing

speeding up the cooking process at the same time i'm keeping the pork chop really nice and moist and now look at the color of that butter it's almost like sort of a nut brown check the color on the other side useful when they're that thick three and a half to four minutes each side 30 seconds from now they're going to be medium so i'm going to take them out and let them rest the secret to

coming up on my ultimate cookery course along with 100 recipes to stake your life on i'm going to give you 100 quick cooking tips to make your life in the kitchen easier first up how to keep your knife sharp it's far harder working in the kitchen with a blunt knife than it is with a sharp knife the secret behind keeping a sharp knife sharpen it before and every time you use it first grip the steel feel really comfortable about holding the still imagine you're holding a tennis racket or you're playing squash you've got to be really comfortable with it now 45 degrees confident grip confident grip with the knife this is the butt of the steel really important you keep your fingers behind there you never grip a steel with your fingers over that because the knife comes back in you've just lost a finger always grip behind nice long strokes so we get the whole of the blade over still stroke and we start from the bottom to the top so there across there across slow strokes over the top of the steel and then come back underneath then back in the knees it is so dangerous working in the kitchen with a blunt knife you can cause so much damage working with a sharp knife is 10 times quicker more efficient now that's ready to start chopping to stop your chopping board rocking or slipping a great tip is to simply wet a kitchen cloth kitchen paper or tea towel and place it underneath now you can chop with confidence [Music] my next top tip is get the most out of your humble veg peeler it's brilliant for slicing ultra thin ribbons or veg perfect for asian dishes great for making long delicate parmesan shavings to top soups and salads it also makes wonderful chocolate curls your pepper mill is more versatile than you might think tighten the top screw to get finely ground pepper ideal for soups and sauces [Music] for general seasoning you want it medium ground so set the screw in the middle and loosen it right off for coarse pepper perfect for steaks and fish [Music] peeling garlic for one clove simply bash it with the back of a knife and the skin comes off easily for a whole head crush separate into a bowl cover and shake hard for about 10 seconds then simply pick out the peeled cloves [Music] this is my ultimate cookery course 100 recipes to stake your life on i'll be showing you a roast chicken recipe to die for hold the drum and slice straight through but first like any good chef i'm always looking to get great ingredients at the right price my shopping mantra is simple first rely on your senses make sure whatever you're buying it looks smells and really feels good and if you get the chance taste it before you buy it second is to recognize that knowledge is crucial the more you know about where your ingredients come from and how they produce the better so ask lots of questions and learn you're never too old to learn from experts and when it comes to buying great birds one person knows what to look for is award-winning fifth generation master butcher danny lid gain poultry is a great meat because there's many different types of birds it's worth tasting the variation of flavours between different birds to birds is massive turkey's a great lean meat that's available all year round not just for christmas anybody who's worried about eating fatty meats it's a really healthy flavoursome meal game birds people don't try them often enough once they're shot they're hung up for a little while but a few days at least it means the meat's going to be more tender it all adds flavor to the birds we've got a wood pigeon and a red leg partridge both really good and cook really quickly when you're buying a chicken some of the things to look out for is obviously the smell and when you're smelling a good quality chicken you can tell the difference the skin's a nice white color and it smells like a fresh chickeny smell when you're buying from a good butcher you'll find you tend to get the giblets as well which is basically the neck and other organs this is great for making gravy once you have cooked it you can use all the offcuts for other things stir fries curries pasta dishes save the bones use the bones for stocks and soups they're really packed full of flavor and remember there are lots of different breeds of chicken all have different characteristics and flavors so shop around and find the ones you love here are three of my all-time favorites the label anglais these come from an old british breed they've got smaller breasts but the meat's delicious the black leg a fantastic french variety succulent with bags of flavour and really meaty thighs and the pulley device this is the rolls royce of chickens rich gamey and delicious one for special occasions i think people should maybe try and buy less meat but aim for the best quality you're only going to get out what you put in by putting the best quality into a dish you're going to get the best results no matter how seasoned the chef you are there are always new ingredients and recipes to get fired up about so if a tired old recipe is getting you down spice it up with fresh ideas and flavors my next recipe is an old classic roast chicken but with a simple twist it takes on a new life and it's guaranteed to impress one of the things i love about cooking and that keeps me excited after 25 years behind the stove is that there's always something new to learn every day new ingredients new techniques and new cuisines start off with the stuffing it's amazing how exciting a stuffed roast chicken can be because it keeps the chicken incredibly moist and gives a delicious texture inside the bird i'm going to start off with cured cerrito this is a traditional spanish sausage and it's garlicky spicy incredibly meaty that gives a little bit of sort of richness to the stuffing get our chriso in start cooking that down and getting all those oils out a little touch of olive oil in there to get it going right onions chopped add the onions to the cerezo and in a matter of seconds they'll change color as they soak up all the flavor that lovely spiciness has been stolen from that sausage now the onions smell incredible garlic garlicky fresh thyme just hold it down and put your fingers on there and it's a really nice way of taking off all those nice fragrant little time flowers you can hear it crackling in the background these are cannellini beans they're waxy very soft not so delicious but very dense but for stuffing they're so robust nothing breaks down drain them off in they're going to take on all that juice as well from the freezer i'm going to season them now because they're very dense so it needs some help i mean that looks like it's a dish on its own good enough to eat now i want to sweeten things up a little bit tomatoes half dried in that sweetens up the stuffing beautiful the stuffing's ready look at the color everything looks spanish it looks delicious now stuffing the chicken i like taking off these

mulch for this salad inspired by my travels across thailand i'm starting by making a wonderfully spicy paste a little salt in there in just break them up this paste is like a staple ingredient in thailand that's what we're looking for almost it's like a powder right next just one clove of garlic slice up the garlic and get that into the pest and water bird's eye chili incredibly hot powerful but wow it does give an amazing kick to the paste in to the mix now a couple of tablespoons of brown caster sugar that softens the blow with a chili and then just to give that nice sour taste a little bit of hot water into this tamarind paste it's really tart but sweet paste one tablespoon in fish sauce now it's got that almost sort of pickly smell slightly salty but the flavor is intense two tablespoons and bring that together and give it a really good mix some lime juice in half another touch of tartness the pace is nice and thick and fragrant but it's got the heat the sourness the tartness incredible green papaya stand it up and give it a little peel you can find green papaya and local asian shops and bigger supermarkets and as it doesn't weld like more delicate veg it's perfect for robust salads like this i grate it look that's what i want these thin slithers next a nice rich sweet banana shalom [Music] nice some carrot carrot gives it another texture now little that and mix it [Music] finish that off with thai basil and fresh coriander thai basil is a much more fragrant basil it's stronger and it's slightly thicker as well like papaya and tamarind paste you can get thai basil in good supermarkets and independent asian stores but normal basil works well too next prepare the crunchy topping pan on and toast some peanuts chop the nuts but it gives a really nice crunch in they go roll them around the pan gas off and just stick them out now for the exciting palm we're gonna dress the salad nice spoon of dressing in to the papaya mix that in and then finally a nice general sprinkling roasted nuts and that is one delicious very fragrant very robust green papaya salad so easy to make and guaranteed not to go limp a perfect party salad and with such incredible colors textures and bold exciting flavors it's sure to grab your guests attention spicy chutney with chutney standing by in the fridge you can always add that special little touch to a simple supper prove that thinking ahead always pays off pan on start toasting those spices keep the pan nice and low cumin very aromatic very fragrant and it's almost like a light spice next nice little coriander seeds coriander in now you're going to get a bit of heat in the chutney mustard seeds well smaller than coriander seeds but so much more powerful mustard seeds in now curry leaves they don't actually smell much dry but the flavor they give off is extraordinary coli's in really important not to burn them otherwise you'll have that bitter taste across the chutney keep the gas nice and low the secret is sort of toasting them so it releases that oil and intensifies the spice touch of salt and then a couple of small powerful chilies keep them whole no one's going to eat them but it gives that real nice burst of heat now let them toast gently there we're not gonna chop the onion we're gonna grate it why because it sort of breaks down to a really nice puree in the chutney when you grate it hold the root in the palm of your hand and just push nice long grates i want those nice long shards look i've almost got a nice sort of onion puree but it's nice and clear a touch of olive oil spices nicely toasted onions in [Music] three nice cloves of garlic lightly crushed some [Music] lay it nice and flat and just slice the garlic nice thin slices garlic in your time to get the owners caramelised beautifully will really reap rewards in the long run tamarind paste and sugar in with the sugar first three nice tablespoons of sugar that will give a really nice syrup effect sort of nice rich syrupy texture to the chutney tamarind paste you can get tamarind paste in most delis and the big supermarkets it's really nice thickening asian but it gives that tartness the chutney and it's sort of rich sugary spicy next in with my coconut add four nice tablespoons that'll give a nice body and a really nice texture to the chutney cook that coconut out and now add the carrot grated the carrot just gives the chutney really nice sort of crunch but also helps to sort of cool down the spice carrots in the water comes out the carrot flavors the chutney beautifully but gives that nice sort of vibrant bright color to it as well and grating it almost sort of it cooks instantly but i want a bit of texture through here turn down the gas and just let that simmer for five minutes if the carrots aren't that moist and juicy then put a couple of tablespoons of water in there to help it along now just cook that out for five minutes just as those carrots start going nice and soft don't overcook them you want that nice texture in there slightly spicy slightly sweet gas off keep those chillies in there for that it's beautiful nice and gooey delicious and ready to go in his jar as that sits in the fridge just gets better and better and better i love to eat this chutney with cold meats or even cold fish but with ham it's amazing it's a really nice way of living up the ham just sort of roll it up get a nice spoon of chutney i mean it looks fantastic chutney onto the plate and serve and that is a nice little gem in the fridge that is worth prepping in advance for vietnamese style fresh prawn rolls one of the keys to cooking for crowds is creating the atmosphere and that buzz getting your guests to sort of almost get involved and dip in and dip out this is an exciting fragrant wrap that is so easy to do first off soak the noodles these are thin glass noodles basically bring the kettle up to the boil and just pour just let them steep there for a couple of minutes the noodles are for my prawn rolls as they soak i'm gonna make a spicy dipping sauce to go with them start off with sugar we're trying to create that sweet sour salty but a really nice sort of heated sauce as well rice wine vinegar that will dissolve the sugar fish sauce now that's going to give it its saltiness next the chili i want the seeds left in because i want some power chilli in a little bit of garlic don't need to chop it too finely just slice it take a spring onion just top and tail them slice slices bring it in nice and thinly so it sort of almost permeates that dipping sauce i grew up with the love of spring rolls but on the back of my visit to vietnam it sort of transformed my respect for a spring roll give that a little mix a little bit of coriander and fresh mint roll them up and chop herbs in there's no olive oil in there there's no cream there's no butter it's just a really nice light dipping sauce and wow all those senses going on now we're gonna make the filling for the wraps a really nice fresh noodle salad rinse the noodles in cold water then chop them into bite-sized lengths prawns peeled and cooked slice them up the prawns give a really nice sweetness next the vegetables i want crunch freshness texture baby gem lettuce and just shred that lettuce next spring onion the good news about these wraps is that you can make them up in advance sit them in the fridge and then take them out literally seconds before your guests arrive peel the carrot so you got really nice fresh crunchy carrot now fresh mint fresh basil and fresh coriander together sounds a little bit bizarre but it tastes amazing don't hold back with the herbs they'll really help make the filling vibrant fresh and aromatic finally touch a lime just squeeze that fresh lime juice over there a couple of tablespoons of your dipping sauce don't put too much in there it just makes all the filling too wet just give that a really good mix that's a very quick simple salad to eat now but let's get it into a wrap now take your rice paper wrap literally 30 seconds in warm water you can get rice paper wraps from your local asian supermarket or buy them online gently lift it out of the water there beautiful lay it carefully onto your board place the mixture at the bottom don't over fill it because it'll be a nightmare to roll fold them over first nice and tightly halfway then tuck in the ends and make sure nothing's coming out the sides beautiful it's so light fragrant incredibly simple to do and there you go a very delicious fragrant asian wrap certainly different to the chinese spring rolls i grew up with you

From Boiled eggs with anchovy soldiers, a Ploughman's lunch with beer bread loaves to an incredible Stuffed rib of beef with horseradis...",2022-11-29 22:16:02.926159, there's something quite nostalgic about a bald egg it's something that's never lost it's magic when you slice that top off and dunk that soldier into the yolk [Music] an anchovy soldier anchovies interpersonal water no salt naturally yeah anchovies are very salty so just a touch of pepper grind them it's a really nice smooth paste the smell of that is almost like being at the seaside now get your soft butter and just put half the butter in first 50 50 is the way 50 percent anchovy 5010 butter that way got that real nice salty creaminess mix that up that's absolutely delicious trust me finishing that anchovy butter on a slice of grilled fish i'm in heaven the bread this is a sourdough delicious very crusty take four nice slices now get that pan nice and hot a couple of tablespoons of that anchovy oil into the pan and then get your bread and lightly fry each side the smell of the anchovy oil is incredible take that out now bring your water up to the boil the secret of softly boiling an egg is to place them into the water gently on a spoon in and just tilt so they don't hit the bottom nice and light up to the boil count to five turn the gas down is it four and a half minutes is it five minutes for a softball day i've cooked thousands of them and every time it's four and a half minutes whilst that's boiling get your bread and spread that on there that is incredible chopped parsley brings that kind of freshness goes brilliantly well with the anchovies hear that crunch on i'm sorry but i can't resist oh my god right gas off one beauty in two i feel like a five-year-old again this is that moment when you open the vault and that little magic inside is all yours there's a great twist on a great classic wow [Music] who would have thought that egg and soldiers could be that delicious [Music] a fish becomes a classic because it's delicious and somehow strikes a cord with us it just works sometimes these dishes can become tired but a clever twist helps make them fresh again [Music] like plum ones with the most amazing but super simple beer baked bread hearty and full of flavor [Music] salt is really important for bread it's the first thing i do once i've cracked it and smelt you want to smell that salt baked throughout beer in about 250 mils of beer [Music] the reason why this recipe works so well is it the beer it's got that yeast so naturally it's gonna work beautifully give that a really good mix i'm looking for the mixture to be quite wet if the dough becomes too firm then it's gonna cook dry in the center just as it starts to fall through the whisk that is perfect beautiful small tins give it that kind of intimacy and i quite like having my own little loaf give the moulds a really nice lining with butter make sure you butter the top now a tablespoon of flour dust inside the mold that will stop your mixture sticking tap out any excess three quarters fill your little molds we're going to allow it to sort of rise just so it comes above the mold and forms this really nice miniature loaf onto the tray a centimeter apart into the oven 25 to 30 minutes at 180. something quite nice about the smell of home baked bread in the kitchen delicious red onion is a lot sweeter less harsh than a white onion the early days of ones you've got those ghastly sharp pickled onions that make you almost cry when you're crunching them i'm gonna lightly pickle my red onion just push your fingers through so you get these nice sort of onion rings a little touch of salt a little sprinkle of sugar and then a couple of cloves in there that gives a really nice sort of perfume and sort of makes the pickling slightly more mellow red wine vinegar now if you haven't got red wine vinegar white wine vinegar it's just as good but red matches the red onion so it goes hand in glove a couple of tablespoons of vinegar just give that a really good mix [Music] as the weight presses down on the onions the clove the salt the sugar the vinegar worked their magic and it comes out with a really nice light fragrant pickle [Music] [Music] now generally it's sort of three parts oil to one part vinegar that's the sort of general [Music] base hmm you don't really think of a vinaigrette with a plan ones but this is a really nice sort of modern approach to plan ones [Music] if i was making a watercress soup i'd use the stalks but the stalks are a little bit bitter so i just grabbed them like that pinch them and then twist [Music] very peppery very hot but so juicy watercress in your celery chop it nice and finely it's the one thing that everybody leaves is that stick of celery so scatter it amongst the sellers [Music] before it comes out i'm going to glaze the top with a little touch of milk that will put a really nice finish to the bread back in for the last five minutes now for the magic and the plain ones generally you'll see it as a ham or cheddar or stilton flour it's hard to dictate which one's the best [Music] brilliant peel some nice shards of that delicious creamy cheddar just get them dancing on top the dressing drizzle ran in circles and then finally our delicious lightly pickled onions give them a good squeeze and look just dot the onions around bread it's ready it's got that nice yeasty smell warm crusty and delicious there you go that is my classic modern version of a traditional stunning playerman's wow [Music] to make the most out of my roast my main course is the delicious stuffed roast rib of beef complete with tangy horseradish yorkshire puddings [Music] but first i'm enlisting the help of my eldest 15 year old megan to reinvent one of my all-time favorite classic desserts eaton mess bomb right eat a mess what's the one thing you love about is a mess i love the meringues now this is a eaten mess with a twist what's the twist in it compared to the normal one we're gonna freeze it so it's almost like a sort of eaten mess bomb wow now i'd like you to whisk the cream please half the strawberries are going to go through the mix and half the strawberries are going to be turned into a coulis strawberries in first a little dusting of icing sugar into the pan and now the icing sugar will withdraw the sweetness from the strawberries and start caramelizing so let me show you a nice quick way of whisking secret whisking is like 10 seconds on and 10 seconds off that way your arms don't get tired now i'm going to take the cream to a three-quarter stage what is a three-quarter mix so we leave some sort of texture in the cream and that's what we call three-quarter whip you've got a nice soft peak they're caramelized there you go we'll put a little touch of water in there that'll help break down the sugar and turn that into a really nice strawberry liquid now to get it really nice and fine i'm gonna blend it on and blitz off okay that's fine i want you to use the back of the spoon and push that through the sieve okay now that way you don't get those seeds it smells so good i love this now nice this is the exciting part wow hold up oh mag megan right now the meringue with your fingers just crush and flake the meringue into the cream how big should i crush it dado there nice big chunks okay lovely oh you okay yeah got me wrangling my eye damn to make this dessert even easier i often cheat by using good quality shop port meringues a little taste that's just cream and meringue wow it's a little tasty okay strawberries in next a couple of spoons of the cooling now look at that now to prepare the mold to transform the traditional eaten mess into a frozen bomb form a triple layer of clim film adding water to the bowl will help the cling film stick as i pour that in i want you to spread it down okay at the bottom and push it down can you hear that crunch yeah the line all right now fold the cling film over put that in the freezer please make young please in the freezer she goes [Music] dessert done now for our main course with a twist that is the rib eye we've had that in the fridge not wrapped so it sort of almost air dries and it intensifies the flavor gross so much quicker and there's less water in the beef for me the only downside to perfect roast dinner is the fight about who washes up afterwards so meg and i are going to avoid that by cooking everything in one roasting tin starting with the spinach and mushroom stuffing [Music] let's do it with a salt and pepper please here we go some of your left shoulder some left shoulder thank you in with the garlic and the mushrooms to toss the pan you push down and pull back down and push back off you go take your time push it down and flip very good that's it push down nicely that was lovely and again nice i'm gonna drop let's see well done well done well then right we're gonna sort of make a little well a little touch of butter in the middle now we need to start putting the spinach in the middle piece so you can push that down the spinach is cold so you're not going to burn yourself be confident in the pan toss it and you'll see it wilting and disintegrating away wow who would have thought all that spinach could fit in this pan because it's a very delicate leaf it sort of cooks so quickly put this all on your board now and then i just want you to go and give that a nice chop then when you're confident with one hand we need to pick up the other knife the other hand chop it nicely good now outside and come in gently good regroup and take your time yes mmm right i love that smell what is that lemon thyme lemon tan that's right so you get your little thyme stalks and you pour down you sort of strip lemon thyme in now tarragon it'll taste brilliant with the beef fantastic with chicken and fish roughly chop the tarragon and i sprinkle the fresh breadcrumbs so the breadcrumbs almost sort of bring the stuffing together next we're gonna get an egg yolk now with the beef this is the exciting part slice with the bone and then come inside and go two thirds of the way down hold that open for daddy salt and pepper and then look we pack our stuffing in there this is amazing it's incredible now just gently hold out there like that okay yeah i'll see you tomorrow what tying string around the rib will keep it all together during roasting not too tight if we tie it too tightly what happens the stuffing will come out that's right that's ready for roasting but we're going to protect it and sit it on a trivet so trivet basically is almost like a sort of little little bed a little bed that's right if you want to enjoy these delicious roast vegetables at their best make sure you remove them from the hot oven after 35 minutes and reheat before serving with your beef now a little mix for the top a couple of teaspoons of mustard powder in salt a couple of tablespoons of olive oil mix that in i'm gonna pour my mustard powder over the beef so this forms a really nice glaze my one pot roast dinner goes into a hot oven 15 minutes at 230 degrees then down to 170 degrees for another two hours for a delicious twist on traditional yorkshire puds i'm going to lace mine with fresh horseradish [Music] start with plain white flour in a bowl and crack in the eggs adding only half of your milk at this stage makes it much easier to whisk all the lumps out and if like me you like your puddings a little lighter and crispier add a dribble of cold water and add salt to season when you're happy your batter is lump free whisk in the remaining milk peel and grate horseradish and add a handful to the mix we can leave the batter to rest while we get the meat from the oven that is beautiful and this is where you really need to let it rest how long would you say to rest it for um i like to rest the meat for at least 20 minutes just the right amount of time for us to whack up the oven and to get our yorkshire puddings in i love using the rich dripping but vegetable all is a healthier option to get the fluffiest yorkshires your tray and fat must be piping hot for best results take your jug of batter to the oven and pour the mixture in there it takes just 15 minutes for our yorkshire puds to puff themselves up and turn a delicious golden brown with the yorkshire puddings on the way and the beef rested we can finish off the eater mess bomb run the bowl under the hot water twist and pull nice wow look at that beauty it's amazing sit that on to your plate now the finishing touches a drizzle of the remaining strawberry coulis i'm just going to pour this over amazing flavor and some grated mint chocolate and that is a nice twist on a classic eaten mess a delicious eat and mess bomb beautiful let's go baby please don't drop that baby meg please it's not around as much dessert sorted and the beef is ready to serve up lift that up place that onto the board parsnips parrots you can see why we kept them in half they've got all that flavor one beautiful big slice for daddy one for maggie and then on the side it's stuffing the stuffing a bit that's the best to die for now fantastic yorkshire amazingly beautiful mm-hmm that's for my daddy and that one that's for me beautiful roast beef with a twist wow [Music] these are my ultimate classics with a twist juicy river beef with horseradish spiked yorkshire puds and scrummy eaten mess bomb topped with strawberry coulis and mint chocolate you

Pre-order your copy of Ramsay in 10...",2022-11-29 22:16:02.926159, [Music] bonaparte's restaurant is in dire straits new owner suray has sunk everything into it it's frustrating the hell out of it because i'm going nowhere the customers are nowhere to be seen how many books non-garden nothing at all no chances of walking perhaps the kitchen's down to two staff and the money has nearly run out i'm going in to identify the problems [Music] i'll find out if the market's there how would you pay for that if a team are pulling together take a [ __ ] penalty and if the head chef is cleaned up enough you're taking the pistol you know i've got just one week to turn this restaurant into a viable business honeymoon's over got to start making profit now [Music] next to its posh neighbors ilkley and skipton sid silvan a little working class town yet to make his mark on the cunnery map of britain lots of fish bars cafes quite a quaint little place little small yorkshire town bonaparte's wine bar and basement restaurant on the high street was taken over by its current owner just over a year ago in her time sue ray has sold everything from donkey rides to cavity wall insulation but the restaurant business is totally new to her and so far the locals aren't biting good afternoon good afternoon sue it is yes please meet you likewise so how's it going a bit quieter today how many did you having for lunch about two two ready that's it and last night last night i think we did only two again that's all two customers the whole because i missed a whole night yeah unfortunately it's just died of death absolutely the stark truth is that two-thirds of russians don't survive past their first birthday and as things stand sue's in danger of adding to those statistics as a last resort she's placed all her trust in a 21 year old head chef together they believe that fine dining will guarantee bonaparte's a brighter future it's like being an artist you know i mean you just start from from nothing and create something so i think that's why i love being a chef from a humble start five years ago washing dishes tim has had a meteoric rise obviously i would like a couple of restaurants maybe three being leeds in london new york you know wherever just big cities you know so that's my main ambition and obviously to make a lot of money tim's ultimate dream is to become a tv chef you put parmesan for this stuff but for now he's embracing his first opportunity to run his own kitchen how did you find tim uh he found me he knew i'd been struggling with chefs and uh lack of them and he's very ambitious he must be [ __ ] good if he's a head chef at 21 no either that or he's a [ __ ] good bullshitter pleasure to meet you sir likewise and just pleasure lee lee so you're the head chef yeah and you're the well you're obviously gonna be the second chef there's only two of you busy lunch no no absolutely not no i didn't think so are you standing there twiddling your thumbs no sue's food takings are a dismal 200 pound a week she should be clearing at least 10 times that but she's not even covering tim's wages let alone food costs and overheads chefs can't get excited unless there's customers to cook for i'll never know how good they are unless there's any customers in the [ __ ] restaurant uh tim hammy's booked non-garden nothing at all no chances of walk-ins perhaps slim i want to see you on a little bit of pressure tonight right it's five to six i want you to get out on the street go knock on a few doors and invite some locals to dinner get your coats on and [ __ ] off for some customers if the customers won't come in off their own free will these two young chefs are going to have to go and drag them in excuse me we'd like to invite you for free fine dining requires the ultimate in presentation [Music] it's like a big cake you've got all the ingredients and you can mix it you're just going to find like consistency to make it rise your goal okay i'll see you there the reputation of this place can't be that great even with free food from the fine dining menu on offer they've only managed to pull in 11 guests for any head chef this would be a walk in the park first order two pigeons main goals one venice one bro where do the tickets go um well i'll just put them there because we never really get enough to worry about it oh [ __ ] me that's nice who's doing what who's in the fish i'll do the fish what would you like to do tonight uh i'll do venison what i'm trying to say is how the [ __ ] do you organize your kitchen take care of the hot starters i'll do the cold stuff did you do the fish i'll do the meat we jump [Music] within reason okay here we go where did you put red bars with the first orders in now i can really see what's going on in the kitchen [Music] what was that i just trashed a load of balls everybody's in the breakfast don't you yeah never mind fine dining they can't even get the bread right it's [ __ ] frozen get it back in the oven are the pigeons ready yes we're about to put them in the bin because the bread's frozen pigeons are coot and the [ __ ] bread's not even out there and if you toss that [ __ ] cabbage once more i'm gonna ram up your ass okay can we yeah everything you turn around yeah let's go even when the kitchen's busy you should be looking to get the starters out within 10 minutes of receiving the order thank you very much these poor souls have waited half an hour for the pigeon breast with mushroom ravioli and that's not the only problem tim you made it over here yes it's burnt can you not taste that man no smell it you honestly can't taste that burnt but now you point it out yeah get that [ __ ] a little bit this is really worrying a head chef we can't even taste his own foods burnt he's not going to win any prizes for his control of the kitchen either and there's only two of them in here can you hear oh no no no buzzing the background that's the veg of the microwave that should have gone with the main course four minutes ago come on tim get the [ __ ] things out for some an hour's weight is just too much desperate to keep our staff costs down sue has got a handful running the bar upstairs and seems blissfully unaware of the farce that's taking place in the basement kitchen's a disaster a desire my disaster beyond belief the blind leading the blind the left arm not knowing what the right arm is doing and you want 50 or 60 seats filled down there and they've got 11 customers in for dinner and up to eyeballs and [ __ ] i mean real [ __ ] everything's going in these cutters for some bizarre reason they think that rings is the sort of ultimate fine dining experience but it's superb i don't understand what what the hell's going on there i don't know all i know is i'm not making money so i don't know what they're at or where they're coming from but it's sue's business and she should be in charge [Music] look at the [ __ ] mess huh i've never seen such hard work for 11 guests doesn't make you feel good does it no not really i've got just one week to make a constructive impact on bonaparte but by day two i'm clutching at straws to find any positives to build on sue lacks focus and has clearly lost control the kitchen's such a tip it's a health hazard and worst of all the head chef and his mate just aren't up to scratch i must be missing something um gentlemen tim sings a dish scallops scarves can't wait to see it nearly every successful resident has a dish that is renowned for i'm hoping that by cooking his tim will produce something truly memorable something truly worthy of a place on a fine dining menu that's your signature dish which is um scallops with uh deep fried powder and black pudding sauce hollandaise certainly looks okay what do you think he's got to be sick he's only gone and giving me a rancid scallop someone get him a drink [ __ ] how can you eat that if you knew they were off what didn't you say no i didn't i didn't know they were off they're [ __ ] minging do not taste that i do now yeah it took a while somehow i know what it means i feel sick myself now it's um it's grim it's [ __ ] grim and it's out of order well i didn't realize you were [ __ ] off so i suppose it's my fault really i could kill some that's the bottom line in the two days i've spent at bonaparte's i've witnessed total incompetence in the kitchen total lack of direction for the management and last but not least they've tried their best to kill me with a rotten scallop what the [ __ ] you playing at sorry well it's not about being [ __ ] sorry you shouldn't be in a [ __ ] kitchen if you don't know what's right and what's wrong in that sense this is basic [ __ ] cooking you know that i need to check if there's any more surprises lurking in tim's kitchen there's a look in here where are they from uh saturday saturday would you use them today no no what the [ __ ] they doing in the fridge it looks like rabbit [ __ ] that one that's just some lentils oh this one's stuck to the [ __ ] glass it looks like sheep's turd that's been infested with ants we've got [ __ ] fur on [ __ ] potatoes when's that from i can't tell you what we do with them throw them in bin but you keep in the fridge for two days before you throw them in a bin do you see what i'm trying to get at you yeah does it make [ __ ] sense yes or no no it's so this [ __ ] fridge is jam-packed with [ __ ] and we're standing here saying i'll get them in the [ __ ] bin this whole kitchen is disgustingly filthy in allowing things to fester tim's putting sue's business at risk can we get that one cleaned out as well yeah just one bad thing can contaminate a whole fridge tim may as well just chuck money out the window a health inspector would have a field day you know what i'm [ __ ] gobsmacked you know i've got a good [ __ ] mind to get hold of [ __ ] sue and just tell her to [ __ ] close the place for me you know that because this is the [ __ ] pits you should be ashamed rock bottom i've never seen anything like this in my entire [ __ ] life you know that because this is a [ __ ] embarrassment to catering let alone [ __ ] ringed out fine dining let's move her not best start it could have been where it to be honest [ __ ] like sorry i saw it out the pitch is becoming painfully clear tim's completely unqualified to do this job he's blagged his way in and sees being naive enough to take him on when you do put so much like hard work into creating stuff and then you know you don't use it you then you get bored that's what i've done like footballers playing with no football in it they just run around what's point will sit on their asses after a while or they that's how it is all this ingredients in there and no customers to send it to and yet none of them have been communicating with each other you know that's got to go tomorrow can we turn that into a fish pie can we do something with it but no they're blindly in the blind and every bloody ingredient in that fridge um is money your money sue has no idea what's going on in her own kitchen key to any successful restaurant is regular communication between management and the head chef i really need to get these two talking everyone just had a word with me and said he's not very impressed we need to keep the place clean and everything tidy otherwise i can be sued in which case i'm out of business and you're out of a job i realise yeah i know and i've technically have to take it on board as well well i'll just have to stick her orange she was gonna say i told you so but that's what she was doing yeah fair enough she had the little dick solo relations between tim and sue clearly aren't healthy lee yeah goggles gloves before we do any [ __ ] cooking in here now i want the place absolutely spotless goggles on please that's it show me you handsome bastard it's not just the kitchen there's a thought here any clued up restauranteur knows it's damn stupid to attempt fine dining in a basement let alone one that's beneath a busy bar [Music] sue's panic is obvious when you see the weird mix of fine dining menus and scrappy handwritten boards advertising tv named cabarets bonaparte's image has clearly confused potential customers she was trying to think to do too many things to be all things to all people so she was trying to have you know live music and have an internet camera and uh also the impression that you got when you came in was she'd be shuffling around in her leggings and her slippers i don't think she's gonna attract the people that she wants to attract it's not as nice as the one that started to cross the road the newly opened competition just 200 yards away has been fully built since it opened so the bundles are definitely out there it's time to find a clear identity for bonaparte and make a clean start valentine's night is just four days away it's one of the most important nights of the russian calendar and it can make or break a new venture if we're going to reinvent bonaparte's image we've got to do it now but we'll sue accept the drastic change of direction i'm about to propose [Music] it's clearly not going to work as a fine dining experience does tim know how much pressure you're under financially i say flippantly you know i'll end up going bankrupt if you're not careful but it doesn't realize how true that is yeah may have close eye in real terms in real terms um probably i've got probably three months maximum jesus you know i'm willing to take constructive criticism it's not working is it otherwise we'd have more people in the basics are wrong i mean the basics are so so wrong and it's you know it's embarrassing it's gonna go back to comfort rustic easy-going food it's gonna become more of a bistro because the place oozes that kind of style i know sue's convinced but if i'm to flush out tim's pretensions to fine dining once and for all i need to provide him with evidence that he can't fail to take on board gentlemen tim right this is a sea of scallops with a uh baby block put in with a nice hollandaise km pepper sauce and a bit of deep fried parmesan it looks like potato but i'm not sure first time you had a scallop and this is a beef and all pie i love it i'm a fashion man yeah beautiful the scallops and the black pudding and the parmesan how much you pay for that well i wanted to pay a lot what do you mean well i don't know anyway aren't there so 850 850. what about and what would you pay for the pie oh my eight pound about eight pound seven ninety five oh i'm not far off an 8.95 well done which one would you prefer well i like the pie personally well i like the me and the left field there mate thank you gentlemen thank you one nil you [ __ ] tim needs to learn a few basic russian rules if you don't know your market you'll never get bums on seats i would probably go with this one two [ __ ] nil next please oh you got two seconds here's another one have you got two seconds russians without customers will go bust you don't like scallops excuse me put another way tim needs to start producing food the people of silson won't be able to resist that is gorgeous you wouldn't pay 8.95 for that in the major cities yeah i'd expect to but that is very good very reasonable and delicious are you listening i am listening be true that's where we're going yeah fine dining who's going in for it it's not bad news you know that it's [ __ ] good news yeah and it's it's it's clearer the writing's on the wall she's come the end of the title up there that's pretty obvious that yeah she's she's had enough huh yeah is that clear yeah it's clear yeah and you know you're [ __ ] cocky with her you know that yeah yeah and she pays your [ __ ] salary are you mad how much have you put in here yeah not a [ __ ] penny not a single penny but you've taken from haven't you yep so now it's time to give back absolutely definitely and not cooking for egos get rid of it back to basics you know that what i want you two to do just to confirm that you do know the basics both at the same time cook me a [ __ ] omelet show me something that i can eat and be happy with anomaly is probably one of the first things you learn to cook at catering college was last time cooked only and cooked one before i've known i've never cooked an omelette before oh don't be stupid look inside what is that telly um slightly overcooked slightly it tastes like [ __ ] rubber i'm both overcooked that was [ __ ] by any standard you're a head chef you're taking the picture you know that you are taking the piss you know that yes carter gives you nothing back and the whole idea of telling him off is to sort of help train him and educate him but clearly not used to being told what to do right make me another omelette [ __ ] it let's go any chef worthy salt should be able to source good quality ingredients at a good price the locals already think bonaparte's is too expensive they want value for money for su to start making any sort of profit tim needs to be clever about what he buys i have two bank assemblies please and two cups of tea he needs to wake up to the real world he's clearly in need of some inspiration for his new bistro style menu thanks donnie thank you that's your on that one don't spill it on those new trainers will you no try not to the chinese tongues tonight we've got a table of four in i want you okay dubai starter main course and pudding 20 quid 5 quid per head right i want to see how clever you are with that money right [Music] good morning good morning i'm making french onions right we're making some french onion soup today so we're looking for some like sort of rustic like baguettes [Music] clearly tim's never bought anything from a market before in his life discount for the trade any discount for the trade it's always worth before you know that so when you're on the telephone in the morning you're checking with your suppliers and you want to know how much the fish is you can always bargain with them i bet you don't seize money this way do you i will do from now on [ __ ] right you will tim's menus are packed with expensive fish and meat cuts he needs to open his eyes to the tasty less expensive options on offer yeah what's that next to the pig's head what is that there um that's oxtail oxtail you ever used oxtail before no what would you do with a braising steak i don't know really maybe barbecue it's quite nice on barbecue you know and when she gets them going raisin steak means [ __ ] braising so it's telling you what to do with it so what would you do with it where is it like a stew you can't put it on the [ __ ] barbecue just looking for some chicken breasts it's a nice pretty blessing yes thank you i love you it's nice check it out have a look how much is it how much is chicken per breast is it your butcher's more expensive yeah jesus four of them please any uh discount for trade just call for trade how much was it you'd come again absolutely the more they see you the more banter you have with them the more bargains you get with them and the cheaper it becomes yeah yeah oh definitely then the restaurant starts to make a bit of [ __ ] money yeah get the picture yeah i get it thanks for that how much we spend just over 12 quid 12 quid fantastic for four portions brilliant okay french on your suit it costs 75 pence to make a portion okay how much does it go on the menu for you times by four and that should cover everything 295 for a bowl of soup and we've made money on that and one thing we're not going to do with ingredients we bought this morning is waste anything we waste nothing with the valentine's extravaganza just two days away i'm under no illusions as to what we're up against [ __ ] limp dick in the kitchen you know give you some [ __ ] energy [ __ ] 21 for god's sake you should be getting [ __ ] 12 hard-ons a day not one a [ __ ] month let's go lee's got a bit of now like whis i've got to hold tim's hand every step of the way are you sure you want to be a chef yes you are yeah in right into the center this is our one chance to see if tim can cope with his new bistro style food turn the knife out put it back in and bring it to the edge there yeah yep gently gently gently make love to it don't [ __ ] it outside leaves yeah what do you do with them you throw them away yeah we usually throw them away but before we let him loose on the pain customers i've asked him to cook for four special people in the privacy of their own home well i haven't told him it's for his own family he's like stir it into it hard no you leave it dangling on top so it gets perfect of course you let it [ __ ] stir inside we've got soup chicken lemon pie yeah let's go and surprise mom dad shall we let's go around to their house and you cook their tea okay create a juice sauce for the chunky um [Music] i don't i don't know i'm asking you yeah i don't i don't think so good because the center is is the sauce the garlic sauce is hello madge how are you surprised i hate to use tim's folks as guinea pigs but with the three-course meal already prepared all tim needs to do is reheat the soup and cook the kievs so we get cracking where's granddad this should be a walk over even for him he was always in the kitchen as a boy wanting to help bake because he loves talking about it doesn't he yes yeah but then he decided whilst he was at school that that's what he wanted to do and he got himself a job in the kitchen and it just went on from there told me that he was going to be a chef and he was going to the good food show to meet gary rhodes and off he went fantastic look what's happened yeah burn it don't burn it here we go sorry keep you waiting that's quite all right he's ready let's not forget tim is a head chef [ __ ] it oh whoops burnt my pants have you don't forget your croutons he's managed to [ __ ] them with his grands house ladies first this is some french onion soup minus the croutons what we're gonna do with this num fun ah look at that superb torched on the outside and pink in the middle as for the lemon meringue pie you would get a better reception if you threw it tim's family wouldn't dream of criticizing him but the paying customers on valentine's night won't be as forgiving we've got 44 books for saturday night and you [ __ ] it for four what chance have you got for 44. now starting to [ __ ] myself it's my fourth day at bonaparte's tim's first attempt at cooking a simplified bistro meal may have impressed his granny but he and i both know the awful truth it was a spectacular flop you paid as a head chef aren't you yeah do you think you should be a head chef not really thank [ __ ] for that don't start crying i'm not well you look you're about to [ __ ] bubble okay so you're delighted with that bookings for tomorrow night valentine's cabaret are piling in with the restaurant nearly booked to capacity i'm trying my hardest to stay positive that's fine mr lowe i'm sure you'll enjoy it but with just a day to go it'll take more than high energy drinks for these two to put it off when someone's been told off the first thing you do in a kitchen is come back at 100 mile now and this guy disintegrates every time you tell him something he just disappears into oblivion and loses all sense of concentration that little short span that he has why don't you swap the rolls around tomorrow why don't you become the sous chef and lee becomes the head chef for tomorrow night no answer whatever you want to do it's your [ __ ] kitchen you're supposed to say bollocks no i'm the [ __ ] chef my name's tim graham he's me on the menu no yes or no yes maybe it's me i should try the softly softly approach we've got a big night saturday night it's full yeah and it's the first time since you've both been here that the place is full okay and whilst i'm here you're not shafting me as well at the same time you know that yeah we're gonna work together over the next 15 20 minutes i want you both to think of something really simple menu wise three starters three main courses and three puddings one definitely soup yeah by passing some of the decision making back to tim i'm hoping to build up his confidence and instill some pride in his food it's hard to write a simple menu when you've had your head up your ass for so long doing trying to make fancy silly food that's the kind of stuff we're going for in it so up main classes living onions mashed potato macaroni cheese fish and chips mushroom peas lemon shot what language hot pot that sounds nice can you come up with the ideas together yeah we'll just flick through some books and thought what what's simple and um you know basically thought what did we used to have at school what did we like at school and i'm not forgetting where are we in yorkshire in devising this new menu i'm aiming to take most of the pressure off tim and lee during service ninety percent of the food can be prepared and perfected a day in advance let's go see if you can show me you can handle two pans at once as long as it's made well they can't fail to be a hit with the customers there should be 15 things going on there all the same time coordination understanding medium pink is it well done onions roasted in short bonaparte's new bistro menu is designed to be idiot-proof definitely identify them as vegetarians yeah let's go come on [Music] so far tim's attitude towards soon has been that of a stroppy teenager rather than a respectful and supportive employee i'm gonna go on um tomato soup rustic tomato soup yeah yeah some little uh cheese that's probably a first it's actually come to us i've had to run down and chase all the time and then i need this and then oh yeah yeah yeah yeah it'll come late i said i need it now basically you just put them through some butter crush them up today seems a lot better i don't know what he's been doing to him down there but he's certainly improving in the week i've been here i've hardly seen tim or lee sample or season anything they've made no wonder their tasteless food is failing to woo the customers everything we do in this kitchen has to be tasted i don't care if it's a [ __ ] bread roll a lemon meringue pie or a chicken kiev you have got to start tasting things from now on bland is off the menu and to teach these two a lesson they'll never forget i'm resorting to dirty tactics you know what a medium steak tastes like yes does that taste like a sirloin t-bone steak or is it a rump steak a sirloin sirloin it tastes like salad [ __ ] your meal here we go now for the cake open up okay tell me whether it's medium or is that well done medium and long well done none of you got that right yes yes pork and [ __ ] lamb [ __ ] it now you don't you don't realize until someone blindfolds and feeds you that your palates are not active could have been worse could have been chicken then we wouldn't look like [ __ ] idiots oh [ __ ] tim's had a week of non-stop grief from me wait wait this boy has really tested my patience all right how do we know they're ready now you can lift them upside down yeah there you go and i really don't know if any of it sunk in do well i'd love to just get it but with more than 40 guests expected in just over two hours time he'll soon be tested to his absolute limits i slipped no no don't tell me it was the mud [Laughter] can't even take a [ __ ] penalty i'll say this for tim he's no quitter and i don't want to see him fail but now he's got to prove he's master of his own kitchen we're not leaving this there's a draw you know that hey in cooking nobody draws ever one thing's for sure tonight he'll either sink or swim [Music] another two upstairs possibly okay good news good news another two so we're up to 50 48 now sue's never had so many bookings she's having to move furniture out to fit more tables in you happy with that chicken kiev we roasted vine tomatoes t-bone stay with homemade chips because there's so many involved for dinner i wouldn't stall them upstairs for too long you're really going to dump us in it big time prawn cocktail three bean salad with mustard dressing what do you think [Music] i hardly dare say it but this place has got a real buzz about it there's one thing missing what do you like on all your menus oh bingo we work as a team and it's a giant effort and bistro you know that's it that's the most central thing you've said to me all [ __ ] wii you know that thank you every decent restaurant in the country is full on valentine's night the competition down the road is packed to the rafters and for once so is bonaparte's in a small town like silson business thrives on word of mouth and if tonight's a disaster it could break soon i have got a fear that he will not be able to cope with the numbers especially when he's saying that 11's busy i don't think so so we'll see what it's made of tim has got to get this right stairs two soup two chicken okay hey six o'clock first order's in okay hello chef yes well why is it give it to scott scott first order in hey are we going to let the kitchen border call out the tickets or are you going to call

repay them for the rubbish he served up a couple of nights ago with a delicious welcome meal [Music] it was lovely that thing it was beautiful [Music] did it yeah hey do you hear what granddad said yeah [Music] [Applause] did you really surprise me tonight and i'm really seriously over the moon that you didn't [ __ ] it i'm serious sir yeah because the first 15 minutes of six o'clock you actually like the biggest twenty in britain you know that all over the shop and you pulled it back together and that wasn't me that was you and the feedback from them out there has been brilliant what does that tell you what does that what does that put in there i had a service like that for a long time and these stupid [ __ ] illusions of grandeur all this stupid fine dining crap that you're trying to do it's gone do you understand yeah exactly where you are now yeah yeah totally do you understand what you're capable of doing within this restaurant yes stop trying to take it beyond something it's never going to be you'll [ __ ] the restaurant and you'll [ __ ] yourself big time to never forget tonight it's up to you now not to allow it i also think you've been confused to what you want because you haven't been focused on one direction for the restaurant because you've been jumping all over and that's part of a panic yeah and that's right and now tonight clearly evident exactly what you need to do from this day onwards and if he changes anything i'll pick his nuts when i arrived at bonaparte a month ago it literally had no customers head chef tim gray was a liability i didn't realize you were [ __ ] off he couldn't even cook an omelette you're taking the pistol you know in one grueling week we transformed bonaparte from a failing fine dining restaurant into a buzzing bistro with tim sending out quality food to nearly 50 contented customers on valentine's night but since i left sue's given tim two written warnings over his attitude now i'm back unannounced to find out what is going that on thing off my god what's going on chilling chilling it's friday night it's 7 30. how many's booked four four and you've got the music blaring away yeah i'm just wesley he's upstairs i'm back he's in a bar what the [ __ ] is that in there muscles you're not serving them are you yeah what the fridge is like oh my god oh my what is that [ __ ] in there there's mold and fur dear oh dear so you haven't changed have you oh [ __ ] you now a whole week drumming into their thick skulls and it comes to this holy [ __ ] this is a living [ __ ] nightmare nobody in this place is taking control and in this state a health inspector would close them down without a second thought so i've got to show you this because it's part of your responsibility and this is your gaff there you go you didn't see this no i didn't actually in fairness to tim he was he was doing okay it seemed to be okay for the first three days then it went from there this is not right this is this is [ __ ] miles away this is a nightmare you know that because it's more loss on top of more loss and more loss and more mold that's what worries me because you need to touch that you need to rub your finger on that you need to go to a chip you need to season something you put your finger in the tomato soup and then they're all [ __ ] you've just contaminated the whole place and that's what really worries me this kitchen is not fit to cook a [ __ ] thing in right now and that's your problem okay i think i better just close and put due to refurbishment and you should burn out gracefully yeah just been giving him another chance and another chance that's that's i can't tolerate that it's just going to end up but it's professional suicide isn't it he's congley as simple as that i don't honestly think he did it deliberately i don't think he's a nasty piece of work i just think he lives in a walter mitty world i begin to think that he's just convinced himself to be honest to go from valentine's day evening to this is it's not even funny there's just something wrong with it valentine's day look good man i don't think i've gone home to bed or whatever feeling in a better happier state of mind and tonight i don't think i could go to bed in a worse one just beyond recognition really anyhow [ __ ] stupid that someone could be you know i mean it's a dog one and who is that someone too no that would be me pretty much yeah at least the bar's busy that is one saving grace but really thank god she closed that kitchen down because it was [ __ ] disgusting i mean really appallingly bad shockingly bad just let me get on with it it'd be a damn sight let you get on with it this floor being needy in sh1t well before you rang me up all aggressive i would get in on me you're fine i was respecting you and giving it all the like gentlemanly bloody stuff i could do and then you went and shot it down [ __ ] pan no don't turn it on me if a floor is filthy before it doesn't matter anymore what's filthy it doesn't matter yes i think it does i think we've established that look yeah [ __ ] the [ __ ] fly that's worse [Music] [Applause] [Music] you

#GordonRamsay #Cooking 

Pre-order your copy of Ramsay in 10...",2022-11-29 22:16:02.926159, [Music] and this is one of my favorites a comforting smoky bacon sweet corn and potato soup thrifty for me is about ingredients that are in the cupboard smoky bacon onions potatoes sweet corn it's amazing how cheap the ingredients are they go into this get your bacon and just cut into nice chunks i want these nice bite-sized pieces smoky chunky and just absolutely delicious it's almost like an american corn chowder potatoes give it starch thickness sweet corn gives it that glossy delicious flavor a couple of baileys they're always hanging around if they're not in your cupboard they're on someone's drive so ask to borrow them they are so powerful and it goes brilliantly well with the onions and the bacon bay leaves in a couple of potatoes it's incredible how far you can stretch something out especially when you bulk it with potatoes slice them and dice them nice and chunky soups are a fantastic way to use up leftover veg or meat that might otherwise go to waste and if you make it in bulk freeze it in individual portions and save on lunches throughout the week so you can see already how hearty and robust the soup is it's a delicious combination onions bacon potatoes and now some fresh leeks open up the leak into four give that a nice wash licks often have soil left in their tops so it's important to clean them thoroughly start sweating that down we haven't even got a corn in there yet and already it's looking and smelling incredible add salt but remember you've got bacon in there which is salty so proceed with caution really important to sweat those potatoes off i love getting that flavor from the smoky bacon in with the potatoes now once the leek is sweated off creamed corn a popular side dish in the states creamed corn is made from fresh frozen or even tinned corn cooked with onion butter and cream and can be bought ready made that starts to give the foundation the soup the creamed corn add the sweet corn then your stock don't flood the soup just bring the stock to underneath the ingredients you can always add very difficult to take away homemade chicken stock is so cheap to make just boil up your roast chicken bones with a few fresh veg and freeze in batches for when you need it lighten the load with a touch of milk that gives a really nice bright color now bring that up to the ball turn it down and let it simmer for 12 to 15 minutes as it cooks slowly the starch thickens the soup the bacon renders and that leek onion starts to puree and the corn just shines okay next we're gonna make the american cheese biscuits in the uk they're known as scones but in america they're called biscuits [Music] first put plain flour into a sieve add baking powder and sift both into a bowl next add some salt pepper and grated mature cheddar cheese mix the dry ingredients then make it well in the center pour in double cream and gently combine with a wooden spoon turn your dough out onto a floured surface and knead for a few seconds only if you overwork it your cheese biscuits won't rise roll out your dough to about two centimeter thick and cut into four centimeter round biscuits [Applause] place well apart on a lined baking sheet and leave to rest on the tray for about 10 minutes then brush the top of each biscuit with melted butter and bake for about 30 minutes at 160 degrees c in a preheated oven when your cheese biscuits are well risen and a beautiful golden brown remove deliciously moorish served hot or cold time to dole out my thrifty lunch i always like to leave a soup to stand or rest it looks richer it gets rid of all the stock i like to have two thirds ingredient one-third of the stock so it looks like a nice delicious chunky soup into the bowl [Music] beautiful tin sweet corn a leek potato and some streaky bacon but it doesn't look like it's just come out of a store cupboard that is proper hearty food [Music] served with my american style cheese biscuits this thrifty lunch may have been made on a shoestring but without an ounce of compromise on freshness and flavor noodle soup with poached egg and spring onions [Music] add miso paste to boiling water japanese misu has a wonderful deep savoury richness and is brilliant in soups grating fresh ginger add dry shiitake mushrooms that have been soaked in water season with soy sauce crack an egg add it to the broth and poach for two to three minutes add thinly sliced portobello mushrooms to a serving bowl put in fresh medium egg noodles which will heat through in the hot meso broth add spinach [Music] then simply spoon the broth into your bowl top with the egg and fresh chopped spring onions so simple so good and so delicious ready in 10 minutes super fast noodle soup with poached egg and spring onions my recipe for meatballs is so versatile it can be used to make a dozen amazing dishes one of my favorites is meatballs in fragrant coconut broth having a freezer of home-cooked delicious food ready to go can be a real life saver it means you never have to compromise on flavor these meatballs are delicious but more importantly they freeze so well first off get your pan on and start sweating off your onions and your garlic this recipe involves making the meatballs a classic way but the exciting part is actually cook them in coconut milk and it gives a really nice new dimension to a sort of soft rich sumptuous meatball chop the onion nice and finely keeping those slices very close together closer the slices the finer the onions pat it back down at an angle slice down and just chop i want the onions nice and fine because i want some finesse to these meatballs the secret of a really good meatball is the texture getting that balance right between the minced beef the breadcrumbs the milk and the seasoning a couple cloves of garlic slice the garlic really nice and thinly nice pan nice and hot a tablespoon of olive oil quite generous with the olive oil onions and garlic in we'll touch the salt and pepper with your mince open it up a little bit and sort of pat it out salt and pepper for me a good meatball is all about the the softness the texture of that rich beef and the way it sort of melts in your mouth you can color it on the outside but you want it nice and soft and sort of rich in the center mix that in beautifully and then paste it back out again i've got some really nice dried chili flakes i'm gonna season the onions with the chili flakes chili flakes in cook that out for two minutes i'm gonna add some milk [Music] take your bread crumbs make a little well three four tablespoons of milk that makes a sort of nice slightly doughy texture but it lightens the texture of the meatball place that in add your onions your garlic and your chilli in there as well nice put your hands in there and start mixing them if you've got the right amount of milk and breadcrumbs doesn't mean binding with an egg don't make them too small the problem with making them too small is the fact that they dry out quickly just the size of a golf ball a little bit bigger nice really nice tight squeeze that stops it from breaking up it always pays to double the recipe and spend a bit more time making extra meatballs so you can freeze a batch ready for another time give the pan a little wipe out don't wash out that pan we've got that flavour from the onions and the garlic at the bottom get that pan nice and hot a touch of olive oil in there place them at the top of your pan nice and gently sit them in the oil get a pallet knife and go underneath them and just sort of tilt the pan and let the pan cook the back of the meatball we're going to add some heat coanda seeds slightly spicy and peppery just to give a really nice flavor to the coconut milk in next some cardamom seeds three or four onto the board knife on in a little touch of turmeric into the center of the pan that's going to give it a really nice spicy flavor a little pinch of cinnamon all the time you're doing this those meatballs are just getting tastier and tastier a couple of dried chilies let them infuse in that oil and then some lemongrass just take the back of your knife and sort of beat it down that starts to release all that lovely sort of fragrance like someone's just let off the most amazing fragrant air freshener in the lemongrass and finally some fresh ginger just peel and slice nice and thinly time now to turn them over and let the other half a wonderful flavor chicken stock in bring the stock up to the boil turn the gas up and then add the coconut milk i want the coconut milk just sitting underneath the top of the meatball coconut milk in and that sort of gives it that creamy richness but it's not heavy it's a fragrant light richness before we start simmering check the seasoning that nice soft texture of the meatball but that fragrance light richness of the coconut broth just gonna cook those meatballs perfectly bring the broth up to the boil then simmer gently for eight to ten minutes touch them with your finger this should be slightly pliable but slightly springy gas off i'm going to finish it off with something light and fresh zest of lime but i want the zest on top of the meatball so cut through that richness and then finally squeeze the fresh lime and that just gives it that nice zesty amazing taste stir in the juice mmm i've got that kick and that vibrant taste now the exciting part when you come to serve it be generous with that coconut broth tilt the pan get a good couple of ladles of the broth in meatballs [Music] and that is a very delicious way of eating a old-fashioned meatball and bringing it into the 21st century and they're just as good cooked from frozen as well [Music] you

Whether you want a roasted tomato soup or fancy something with a bit of a kick, like a spicy clam noodle soup - we've got you covered.

#GordonRamsa...",2022-11-29 22:16:02.926159, soups can be light and delicate or rich and gutsy they're versatile practical and easy to make and for my ultimate hearty lunch i'm making one of my childhood favorites roasted tomato soup beautiful vine tomatoes the riper the tomatoes the better the soup take the core out get your thumb and place it half a centimetre underneath the tip of your knife place it in and then just twist around that's the only part of the tomato that we're not using red onion and garlic red onion because it's sweeter than a white onion slice your onions and your garlic nice and fine traditionally be making it in a pot it's so much better to start it off on top of the stove searing the tomatoes and the garlic when it goes in the oven you actually roast the tomatoes and they don't stew there's a big difference in flavor be quite generous with the olive oil it makes the soup nice and glossy shiny salt pepper and then a little teaspoon of cayenne just gives it that heat but it's not as fierce as chili take your tomatoes and just slice them in half and then a little touch of sugar that's gonna help intensify the sweetness a little sprinkle of aged bottled vinegar it gives that nice dark rich acidity to the soup into the oven 20 25 minutes 180. to make my soup even more irresistible i'm going to make a punchy sun-dried tomato pesto to drizzle over the top now i'm making this in a pestle and mortar because you feel so much more in control and you're not depending on a blade that's whizzing around at a thousand miles an hour next in a dry pan toast off some pine nuts toast them the absolute max and then in smell in there is incredible parmesan lightly grate that this is where it starts to become creamy extra virgin olive oil doesn't need salt because the parmesan is going to season it for you and just take a couple tablespoons of the oil that the sun-dried tomatoes are in really helps to make that stunning pesto i can smell those roasted tomatoes want them out wow next pour in a little vegetable stock or chicken stock so it sits halfway up the tomatoes put your spoon through those tomatoes they break up instantly bring that up to the bowl let it simmer for three or four minutes i want to make it a little bit more creamy now cream in give that a little stir you can keep it rustic and you get your masher in and you've got that nice thick rich chunky tomato soup or get yourself a stick blender blitzing it like that you delays the bottom of the pan and you get all those amazing flavors from the bottom that's delicious to make my lunch extra hearty i'm gonna knock up a deliciously gutsy version of cheese on toast to go with my tomato soup whilst we have it an absolute classic i'm gonna make a roux 50 grams of butter three nice tablespoons of flour and that's all the roux is basically traditionally you would use flour butter and milk but in welsh rabbit the milk is often cheekily substituted for a stiff slug of stout gives it that strong gutsy flavor i want it nice and thick make sure those lumps are out a nice teaspoon of dijon mustard and then season it nice and spicy moisture sauce gives it that delicious intriguing flavor now that smells amazing almost brings tears to your eyes beautiful now whilst rabbit wouldn't be a stunning welsh rabbit without rich mature cheese soap and a great montgomery cheddar goes well with the beer and drop that in really important to put this in while the roux is still nice and hot because the cheese melts now for the bread i prefer a good rustic country loaf that will stand up to my hardcore topping i want that nice crisp base to my welsh rabbit so toast it both sides [Music] spread that beautiful cheesy berry spicy mixture just great got a blister and bubble and gratinate god a little splash alien perry and back under the grill for 90 seconds in one delicious creamy roasted tomato soup it's coming back to me all those days i had off school i used to purposely lie about feeling ill just to get a bowl of my mother's tomato soup how bad was that but my god it was worth it oh now my welsh rabbit [Music] look at those babies that just takes cheese on toast to another level wow roasted creamy tomato soup with a sun-dried tomato pesto served with the most amazing delicious welsh rabbit i feel like ringing in sick [Music] all over southeast asia you find people cooking and eating the huge bowls of delicious noodle soups it's a very simple dish but the variations you get are extraordinary different meats different fish and even different dumplings but what i love most about noodle soup is the fact there's a complete meal carbs protein and vegetables in one big bowl of happiness for my ultimate southeast asian lunch i'm showing you one of my favorites spicy clam and noodle soup followed by sweet morish banana and coconut fritters for dessert first up my dessert banana fritters take your bananas and to get them really nice and soft just rub the banana sip together flour and baking powder sugar into the flour then add coconut for texture and a pinch of salt sounds strange in the dessert but it works brilliantly especially with the fritters it makes the batter nice and crisp start crushing and use the back of the fork and just push it against the side of the bowl and then once you've mixed that through i'm gonna make that mix now slightly fragrant with some lime zest now the lime just really elevates the sort of richness and the denseness of the banana cover with tim film so it doesn't get a skin on top sit that in the fridge for 15 minutes as the banana fritter mixture rests i'm getting on with my broth for the noodle and clam soup fish stock is the base bring that up to the boil now to take that broth to another level in with chopped shallots fresh ginger add a whole chili seeds and all i actually quite like it spicy adjust chop once and into the broth bring up the ball and let it simmer galangal it's sort of almost like a softer version of ginger slightly milder you can use galangal paste but i prefer the fresh stuff the stems for the coriander we'll finish the broth with the heads and that's what endeared me to the southeast asian style of cooking across my travels there was there's no waste in lime leaves for me one of my favorites incredibly pungent strong full of flavor very acidic but gives a really nice aroma to the broth just tear them in now the lemongrass so the secret here that's where all the flavor is right at the very end so you take the back of the knife and you just bash the lemongrass it's all that flavor is going to run out in seconds that's the base of the broth done the longer you leave it the more intense it gets whilst the broth infuses soak your rice noodles in boiling water for 10 minutes just enough time to fry your fritters the batter now is ready use a metal spoon to drop the batter to the bottom of the pan they hit that oil they puff up that's why it's important to put your spoon into the oil so the mixture runs off and creates this lovely little fritter and then gently fry get a slotted spoon and nice and carefully turn them the smell of that lime is extraordinary fry for two to three minutes as they start floating it signifies the fact that they're cooked off with a gas and just let them drain are those beauties lovely sprinkling when they're hot with a sugar actually sticks to them they're done ready to go the last job before serving the clams never be scared of cooking shellfish the most important rule is if they are slightly opened a millimeter discard it make sure mussels clams are always tight cook the clams for just three to five minutes or until they're all open bring that up to the boil and this is where we finish the broth touch of fish sauce a little sprinkle of sugar drain your noodles into the bowl for added texture some delicious bean sprouts get your lime fresh squeeze and lime juice in beautiful literally as the stock comes up to the boil the clams open automatically so they cook beautifully the flavor from inside the clam has enhanced the broth smell is incredible the clams cooked finish with fresh coriander and serve there you have perfect lunch a delicious spicy clam noodle with an amazing banana fritter my spicy clam noodle soup and banana and coconut fritters made in minutes and proof you only need to travel as far as your kitchen to get the taste of southeast asia [Music] spicy mexican soup it's hearty delicious robust but served with some tortillas and a wonderful salsa it's almost like a complete meal in one starting with some finely chopped red onions for my soup let's get some heat going early these are chipotle so they're smoky rich they don't come with any warning signal and these are seriously hot so be adventurous but beware a nice teaspoon of toasted cumin oregano dried now start frying off spices the heat you'll see the chilies start swelling up delicious garlic be quite generous on the oil because that helps to blow out the chili right now those onions and garlic are on fire we're gonna balance the sort of heat from the chipotle with sugar turn up the heat and really start caramelizing that sugar and the chili gives off the most amazing aroma next fry up a tablespoon of tomato puree add a can of chopped tomatoes cook kidney beans and vegetable or chicken stock to cover there's something quite exciting about big and bold flavors because in the restaurants you have to be somewhat controlled you can't go crazy so cooking these kind of dishes at home gives me that kind of release chilis particularly when they're dried continue to swell and release their heat as they're cooked so the longer you cook your dish the hotter it will be but it's not as powerful it needs to be yet and every five six seven eight minutes that's gonna get stronger hotter and more delicious bring that up to the ball and cook that out for 15 minutes whilst i allow the chili heat to infuse i'm going to crack on with quick crunchy tortilla chips and a fabulously fresh and spicy tomato salsa known in mexico as pico de gallo start by finely dicing three ripe tomatoes one or two deceeded fresh jalapeno peppers and half a red onion then chop a good handful of fresh coriander add the juice from two limes salt and pepper and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil for the tortilla chips rub a little olive oil onto six large shop bought wheat wraps sprinkle with smoked paprika and gently massage in cut each wrap into triangles and spread them onto a baking tray bake for three to four minutes in a preheated oven 180 degrees until golden brown and leave to cool to complete my mexican lunch i need to finish my deliciously fragrant spicy soup the spice is there it is absolutely spot on now for the cooling down process the mexicans are brilliant at building layer upon layer of flavor with delicious chilies and spices but they're also experts at tempering their dishes with cooling ingredients like avocado sour cream and cheese that's why you can take that amount of chili you'll have a spoon of richness spice and all of a sudden avocados almost like a little fire blanket over those chillies to further counter the chili heat mexicans use a rich tangy crumbly cheese but i'm sprinkling on lancashire which is a great british substitute and last but not least cooling fresh coriander one delicious spicy mexican soup serve that with your tortilla chips and your pico de gallo salsa a phenomenal blend of textures and layers and spice and creaminess big bold and delicious

still doesn't erase the bad taste of the rest of the meal let's talk about the food dessert let's go backwards okay yeah that was delicious good great enjoy it really good great way to finish clearly but i certainly didn't start off like that i said to you show me your best give it to me big time the risotto was embarrassing paul it tasted the way it looked damn is that normal bland mushy and it looked atrocious honestly it was [ __ ] disgusting the chicken how many days were you baking that for seriously i mean you may laugh but it's not funny honestly i thought i'd lost my tooth it was so crunchy on the outside dry in the middle it wasn't intended to be dry or to be overcooked uh you sent it out i know that that's the way you normally cook it over done certainly don't think that i cook food over time okay risotto overcooked chicken overcooked you certainly did for me okay i i need to get some fresh air i'm gonna come back later i'm here tonight show it to me okay hopefully this time with a little bit more effort okay did you think that he was gonna like it [Music] it angers me that paul has given up because i haven't given up you're like i want the nightmare to be over [Music] this former manhattan star chef failed to impress chef ramsay at lunch now it's time for chef ramsay to see how paul handles the customers of ridgewood new jersey in a dinner service all right guys we got to get ready i hope paul could get his [ __ ] together the food is there the capability is there you just have to do it it's like you have to [ __ ] our cut off the pot hello good evening can i take your wine there you go you can enjoy and this is ow ow good to see you you're a sous chef right yes this kitchen's like a [ __ ] shoe box in here yeah i know holy crap i think chef ramsay doesn't realize that i worked with a lot of very well-known chefs it's not intimidating i have the talent the desire and i definitely can do the job crab cakes across the board so for this result you smell good i smell good i have to sharon are you hitting on me no i like the aftershave it smells nice oh maybe just brush your eyes halfway no i'm not gordon is adorable and of course he's not quite the butt i'm sorry order in the crab cakes are ready okay thank you how come they cooked already they're pre-seared [Music] you sarah crab cake no we appreciate the crab cake and then it goes into the oven now hold on a minute why wouldn't you do that to order for it to expedite it out a little bit faster we're sure that it'll take longer to get yes hotter one's already cooked yes is it new or does that not make sense it doesn't make sense it doesn't make sense [Music] here is your crab cake sir may i get you any fresh pepper on that oh no thank you no how strange how are they doing this is a bucket of crab cakes that just go into the oven to be reheated but they were sit off like yesterday did you know they were done the day before of course not i thought everything was fresh everything i feel like paul is losing his artistry and that he doesn't care it's not affecting him it not only pains me it it angers me quite frankly i mean that's just not okay it's all burned on the side all i can taste is the food it's burned is it really yeah is everything okay with your pancakes i need another crab cake on the fly what do they say i was burnt burn yeah there's two more we're about to go out please tell me i'm not gonna serve them no i'm not sure we had issues with the crab cakes tonight it's not the right way to do it it should be done a different way and i know how to do it a different way but that's not how it was done that is not it's [ __ ] disgusting yes do something about it please pull yourself he's a garbage this is not a reflection of the way that i want things to be okay so how are we doing back there right i'll go check for you it's an hour into dinner service and very little food has left the kitchen in order to get an accurate picture of the slow down that's not ready there's no potatoes on it honey okay chef ramsay times how long cooked food sits at the pass [Music] i just think i eat sitting here waiting for our food okay four minutes sat there steak paul that's still there yes i'm working on everything everything is working hey let me bring some food out there yeah but does she have her paul is communicating but most of his communication is that he can't handle it and it's going too fast you're going to have to leave though yeah no all joking about this yeah at a good point it is a little bit like a little yeah okay these people are gonna leave if i don't get this one out he decides how fast things come out i don't know why it takes so long i just know what takes so long okay table 32 can now go thank you i love them finally yes and now after a long wait those potatoes look a little overdone the customers aren't satisfied okay no problem i'll send that back for you okay thank you paul what's wrong hi it's cold oh come on i've certainly become annoyed with clients and i feel like you know people that want to give you criticism they just don't know like what you're going through and if they just knew like a little bit of what you were going through they might be a little bit more compassionate but it's not a compassionate business is this going paul i'm just worried about food coming back cold and this is sat here i was told that the salads would be ready i'm waiting for the salads take half of that salad off me are you building a [ __ ] christmas tree no half the plates don't look the way they should when i don't do them well when i put them just take half of the salad off please follow my direction so i'm gonna help you okay i'm not here to hurt you i'm here to help you contrary to what everybody says i do know a few [ __ ] things easy to sum up paul's moods if he were a woman he would have pms 24 7. okay so let me demo a chicken milanese for the 400 [ __ ] time which is nothing more than chicken and salad and my 12 year old can [ __ ] do it yeah listen don't push it paul when i don't put it high enough you yell at me that it's not freaking high enough why do you have to make it so difficult for it why can't we why can't why can't we just finish this chicken milanese and make this particular chicken milanese a right one not talking about yesterday not time or next month but what's with the [ __ ] sarcasm you don't want [ __ ] well i'm not saying you changed a year what the [ __ ] you want from me changing it right well you told me the first [ __ ] time we already have to make it so difficult why can't we the battle to get food out tonight has resulted in a war in the kitchen well what's with the [ __ ] sarcasm what the [ __ ] you want from me and the impact is being felt in the dining room get my food now who's waiting one 34 has been waiting for like an hour i know this big tail were behind me what are they waiting on who's table was that julie's how long are we waiting on trays over an hour yeah it's over an hour this is not normally surely no no tonight is the worst dinner service that i have ever seen i mean i have never experienced anything like this in my life okay there paul yes sir i don't know what's happened but the level of frustration out there is intense so stop we can't continue like this stop it will you apologize the tables please rebecca what a freaking disaster bad i know it was a terrible night we had people not get food when tickets were here we failed tonight it's my responsibility sorry my friends the kitchen has been shut down i'm so sorry i've never had to do this before i never saw anything like that my weight i understand that do you think that i like this you think that i want it to be like this i don't but but what i'm one person with two hands well you don't please don't start with excuses that's not gonna help paul had a horrible night a hundred percent off his game and i think gave up before he even got started but people hated the food well that's not what we got back here i'm very angry saying that someone liked something 50 people didn't like it open your eyes i have nothing else to say to you equally as miserable as tonight's dinner service was paul's attitude and chef ramsay wants to know why tonight showed me that you hated cooking i cannot ignite that little button i need to see it from you jeff i feel awful i this is not the way that i want to work or the way that i know that i can work why are you doing it to yourself i i why you've got to give me the answer because i can't start helping until you tell me but i mean no one's asking you to rant and rape i'm just asking to have some fire it's not normal for a guy that's been cooking for 20 years plus to stand there with no feel or passion and send [ __ ] like that as if it's just going over your head whether you like or not you have given up your whole family is on the line here do you know how hard it is to look at my kids when i go home at night [Music] for my wife [Music] it's not easy okay it's supposed to be easy i don't care if it's not easy i just want it to be better but don't stop trying [Music] think i'm happy i'm miserable i don't want to get out of bed in the morning i want to stay in bed [Music] okay listen i'm committed to helping you and i'm not leaving this place until it's set we are going to work at this together at turning this around tomorrow i want you at your best yes yes get some sleep thank you good night [Music] after an emotionally draining night chef ramsay has a task in mind to help ignite paul's passion in the kitchen good morning hello um new day new attitude new start so last night it took us an hour on average to get appetizers out so here's what we're doing today i want you to get used to the time pressure see i'm saying like sort of you know kickstarting the [ __ ] car again you know a new battery in it you've got 15 minutes yeah from now to cook me a stunning pasta dish off you go try to kill me you can do it 15 minutes in order for paul to impress chef ramsay this chef is making fresh pasta for the first time in five years i just want to be able to do what i know how to do it just you know just cook from the heart and uh get back to raising the bar for myself what are you gonna make i'm just getting a lady to land that's all yeah 14 minutes the cloth is ticking and it's just you know like everything around me was just turned off like i wasn't hearing or seeing or feeling or worrying it was just you know i was living in the moment [Music] 10 minutes babe he's sitting he's ready he's waiting to be served you could totally totally wow him right now please i was watching everything that he did and i was definitely afraid that chef ramsay wasn't going to like it and and what that would mean can we carry it out i'll carry it out you sure you want to do that yes all right hey here we go chef thank you you're welcome we have a capolini pasta with a chunky pontodeska sauce and some rock shrimp lovely well i used to be a good chef i think i'm still a good chef i would just want him to be able to recognize that there was a passion that went into making it [Music] chef ramsay has put paul's passion for cooking to the test we have a capolini pasta with a pontenesca sauce lovely now it's time to find out if he passed i would hope that chef ramsay would recognize that you know some love went into making this dish will it be to his taste [Music] who knows that's nice capillini cooked perfectly thank you it just felt good to just have a really positive comment i'm chef ramsay i really needed that lift what does pasta mean to you to me it's like bread at staff of life pasta can be anything you can go through all different flavors textures proteins colors you can have dried pasta fresh pasta it's a blank canvas it's no it's it's just something for the artist to paint you're sounding more exciting in the last two minutes talking about pasta than you have done since i've met you it was the old paul he was excited he was energized it was the man that i married and it's really weird isn't it it takes something like a pasta dish to sort of ignite how you feel about it absolutely today at this moment i know that like the healing process has begun after a small glimmer of hope this morning chef ramsay wants to try an experiment time for some sophisticated marketing he wants to take advantage of the ridgewood foot traffic and test paul's speed in the kitchen how are you so for the first time in four years bizzini's is open for lunch having lunch today fabulous lunch menu around the corner business 15 soup salad and the most amazing pasta wonderful thank you so much thank you now chef ramsay only has one thing left to do

could really believe it come on guys please when you just left high and dry like that it's a little difficult listen to me al may be gone but the customers need feeding let's support one another but as a human being with compassion you go in you help and you give it your best shot all right take a deep breath i'm glad to help if you cook the garnishes i can cook the lamb the strip yes yes let's go then i can only imagine what's happening in that kitchen back there start working on three tags two pepper deli straight after yes yes good i'll do the risotto sharon are you with me i'm totally with you shower congratulations to the new sous chef i'm very embarrassed our sous chef walked out it's not even paul it's too tight you know it's like it's like staunch yeah good girl sean thank you chef good girl let's go talk to me come on paul please i'm one minute from dressing i'm one minute from dressing jeff i'm working it's still gonna be a few minutes i apologize tag special in the window thank you sharon service please to save tonight's dinner service chef ramsay has taken over the kitchen come back to the risotto please and along with sharon's help hold on sharon food is now entering the dining room asking each other sometimes in time received but now the question is do the customers feel it was worth the wait the food is fantastic worth the wait risotto has a wonderful taste mm-hmm [Music] we had some challenges you know we had some things that weren't expected to happen but that said everyone stepped up as best as they could got good feedback from the people so you know i feel with success before i spend some time with paul and leslie i just want to say a big thank you yeah your desserts are fantastic over the desserts your personality is for me fundamental to the longevity and the potential success of this restaurant and i just want to say uh a big thank you welcome i enjoyed his company i think he enjoyed mine and i hope i made him proud thank you because i really tried very hard [Music] right that wasn't easy no no nowhere near it uh however i know the customers love the food absolutely yeah and tonight confirmed that you have an identity the fresh pasta is out there but truthfully as hard as this is for me to say to you face to face honestly paul you haven't changed enough to convince me that this can turn around [Music] i was totally focused and totally committed no no no you weren't poor jeff no come on big boy the first appetizer had raw squid not slightly seared raw 20 minutes later the place was sunk you needed me i regrouped got the kitchen back together i've never worked this hard in launching a restaurant the truth hurts paul you've got to start telling yourself some serious home truths the way to becoming a better chef is to realize your weaknesses and improve those weaknesses i've taken all of the advice and i've taken a lot of it to heart and i've seen a lot of it of what i do is wrong here's my advice at the heart of this restaurant has to be you your food you on the plate you have to stand up to the plate and hold the reins i know that it starts and stops with me and i know that i have to be the leader and i know that i have to command the troops and i take responsibility for it you say all the right things always but now it's time to do the right things rice can i think i think that jeff ramsey came in and really identified the problems and i think he certainly helped paul and i totally feel that all the tools we have are enough to save the restaurant chef yes chef good luck thank you very much yes appreciate everything appreciate all your good work and and everything you've done for me it's over to you now i won't let you down this experience has been amazing i've been put on the path to success that i'm really excited about going forward please don't let yourself down thanks very much good night what a week ridgewood may have 60 restaurants within four blocks but i do believe the new bezini's with its fresh pasta can be a huge local success unfortunately i'm just not sure about paul but nothing would make me happier if you could prove me wrong [Music] after gordon's departure paul immediately hired a strong sous chef and with the new fresh pasta identity vizzini's experienced a boost in business sadly sharon left the restaurant to get away from paul and to focus on her own dessert business [Music] you

Follow Gordon:...",2022-11-29 22:16:02.926159, in tonight's final it's india versus britain as two outstanding chefs battle it out for the title of the f word's best local restaurant their challenge is to come up with three stunning dishes made with jani street porter's delicious pork beef and chicken my first finalist tonight is la san from birmingham [Music] when i first walked in the door at la san i could send straight away that it was something special nice atmosphere it was cool contemporary and stylish we were the first restaurant to break away from the mainstream and offer alternatives to your bolts and your tikka masalas that's exquisitely presented vanessa actor how are you i'm very welcome in the kitchen i discovered head chef akhtar swimming against the tide refusing to serve up familiar indian crowd pleasers like chicken tikka masala what's the ambition lasan what is it it's not food for people who haven't got an educated palette it is a very sophisticated cuisine there's something very special about la sam's dishes and they serve me some of the best food i've tasted outside india the murk mahoney and the butter chicken absolutely delicious melt in your mouth and yeah authentic but my winner tonight must also be committed to delivering the very best service to its customers so for the semi-finals lassan had to undergo three grueling tests first up i sent in secret diners is it possible to change it too hot for me sorry oh thank you attentive service yeah good and then 30f where diners visited la san putting aktar's kitchen under immense pressure [Music] how much longer can you give me a time at least 10 minutes at least he's got to get a grip there's a customer set upstairs minus the main course which is not good enough akhtar is very confident and sometimes he can be a bit too cocky for his own good how'd you find the money chef i thought the food was outstanding doesn't mean go finish sorry but i love his ingenuity and his fearless determination to take risks with his cooking pedigree and saffron for the potatoes no the saffron's actually in the uh the gravy and the gravy yeah that's right in the third test at my flagship restaurant at royal hospital road akhtar revealed his more sensitive side we've always been knocked for our approach by people within our industry [Music] you for pushing the barrier wow absolutely phenomenal you taste it and it blows your mind away my other finalists tonight couldn't be more different the pheasant from rural cambrisher as soon as i set foot in this rustic restaurant i was completely seduced by the warm atmosphere that husband and wife team jay and taffeta have created let me get you a menu very cozy those ceilings beautiful buildings from the outside that's roof and feels and looks and smells british the pheasant is a slice of paradise in the heart of the english countryside we have customers that sort of would just turn up and throw abrasive pigeon down or the other day we had a guy gone shooting for some mallard we trade off we might cook them a duck supper and that's payment for it really they just don't want to see anything wasted the pheasant serves wonderful british food and hfj is so devoted to the local produce he gets his ingredients from the farm next door we've got the cows and you know we've got pigs and all that sort of stuff we cook everything of the animal especially like all the awful you know i love offal so why not use it partridge you know tough bird to cook they go dry within seconds so uh yeah that was delicious my team of secret diners confirmed that the pheasant was just as good when i wasn't there would you prefer they're good and when i turned up with my coach of f word diners they cope brilliantly yes service is friendly attentive again and everyone's little busy bodies running around making sure bread butter water and constantly observing which is always nice jay's a very controlling chef very hands-on but everything functions around him he's at the sort of central point on the hot plate and everything comes up to him so he misses nothing everything's scrutinized overseen tasted as well a good sign when things do go wrong however jay's head can drop it's [ __ ] hard it's [ __ ] [ __ ] okay yeah just sat too long or rested like that needed to be on a rack [ __ ] one day it [ __ ] matters and we can't do it [ __ ] properly but in the semi-final at royal hospital road jay proved once again what a fantastic chef he is does it work my god that's amazing now lassan and the pheasant face one last test tonight they'll be batting out for the title the f word's best local restaurant service is about to start and this is gonna be the fight of their lives i will have the final say on who wins so who's it going to be it's too close to call only one can win this needs to be the best service of your lives tonight we're going to be crowning the f word's best local restaurant it's indian versus british in tonight's final the pheasant from cambridgeshire and la san from birmingham are battling out in the f-word restaurant in their toughest challenge yet they're cooking their own recipes using beef pork and chicken that janet street porter has provided from her farm in yorkshire who will like crown the f word's best local restaurant [Applause] wow right first of all welcome back what an amazing journey it's been for all four of you to be here in the final really well done right jay how you feeling anxious welcome back to guy thank you actor how you feeling very good chef um yeah i'm ready to go gentlemen one of you okay who's gonna win the title of the f words best local restaurant tonight there's one shot at this no rehearsal personally the journey has been phenomenal i am so glad that both restaurants are back here tonight why because you both deserve heavily to be here i've packed the dining room purposely okay with food writers critics from all over the country they are a tough budget just have a look at them look at their faces this is the final their comments are absolutely critical but i will be deciding who is the winner now make it your nights okay each restaurant is going to make 25 portions of their starter then you're each going to do 50 portions of your unique main course and then back to 25 portions of the dessert each yes so really make it work yes let's go excellent okay let's send first off here four covers away to everyone four chicken yeah four beef four dessert no answer huh yes chef sorry when you give me that level of confidence shout out yes sir yes sure i turn my back i can continue when it's silent you haven't got it you know the school you've been here yeah let's start again i don't wanna [ __ ] it was table one yes last sound here we go first ticket four chicken four beef for dessert yes chef hassan yes sir thank you welcome back both brigades are cooking with animals from janet's farm here's la san starter with street porter chicken actor's been on an amazing journey during this competition in the semi-final the cocky arrogant facade finally cracked i was so disappointed with the way things went i thought you know i've lost it and that was it but then when chef turned around and he said i've made it through to the finals with my team you know it's absolutely amazing and you know once again i broke into uh tears so i won't be able to walk into a local anymore without having the piss taken out of me there's an order for that tonight is chicken tandoori masala with mint chutney first akhtar rubs the chicken with garlic and a ginger paste we're trying to get as much flavor into the chicken as possible next he makes the marinade most marinades always start off with mustard oil so here it goes next he adds ground cumin tandoori masala garam masala ground fennel seeds and white pepper then he adds coriander coats the chicken and leaves it to marinade i think this marinade is definitely going to quite wonders for janet's chicken actor then fries the marinaded chicken to seal it just trying to get a bit of colour on it and finishes cooking in a hot oven for about eight minutes he serves with a salad in a coriander dressing and mint chutney this is typical aktar he's fantastic at using great presentation to take indian food to another level chicken tadori masala with mint chutney served now even from here yeah that smells delicious tonight you know that hey guys taste taste taste yes asan everything you do you taste yeah nice did you go foraging for them our man did you know he's foraging for us a nice phone call for me at midnight last night saying what good news or bad news telling me to tell you that you got stung picking them by wild bees we got stunned by wild bees at midnight what the [ __ ] we're doing right in the middle of winter was he somewhere he shouldn't have been i think he might have been the pheasant are using janet's pork for their starter head chef jane has upped his game at each stage of the competition he likes to use every part of the animal so for a starter he's going to use the pig's head to make a brawn quite an ambitious dish it's really important not to waste waste a thing so you've got to be inventive in how you're going to scrape the bones down to make a train or or whatever you know that's what we practice here the pheasant is what life is all about we do put everything into it you know [Applause] i want to be the best i want that accolade of being gordon ramsay's best local restaurant check on one check on one prawn the pheasant starter tonight is brawn with crisp pork belly to make the brawn jay cooks the pig's head with vegetables herbs spices and pig shotters rawn is a traditional english coarse pate once cooked he removes all the flesh from the bones along with some of the skin you'll be surprised the amount of meat that there is actually within the head see that's that's the cheek you know there lovely little nugget of meat to flavor the brawn he adds parsley green peppercorns and mixed spices [Applause] jay uses half the brawn to make the capacio the other half is breaded and deep fried jay's braun capacio is served with hard-boiled egg baby leeks and a chopped apple salad finally the dish is finished with a slice of fried pork belly brown with crisp pork belly served hey tell me about the recipe well braun is born yeah uh the reason for the carpaccio just to sort of lose the ick factor yeah they're ladies really i mean it's a very robust yeah you know if they're all foodies though if they even if they don't like the idea of brawn they'll try it and i'm sure if they try it they'll like it okay guys well done yeah they look fantastic you happy with those yes sure yeah yeah yeah they look amazing yeah really really good now we're doing five servers please go next yeah first time why are you slicing it upside down colored side presentation side down yeah presenter no no the other way precise from the presentation side have you not been watching me actor joe's got tablet already but it's not a race yes this is not a race yeah it's all about getting it right come on listen please no problem i've got to put it up there this way now actor happy man i'm very happy with you happy yes good very nice they smell delicious by the way thank you very much absolutely delicious love the colors servers please nice and gentle on the plates four on table one please yeah are they gonna stick stand by yeah yes yeah actually they look fantastic love the smell the chicken dish was really close to being a great dish but it just wasn't quite there in the spicing there was just too much chilli and therefore they lost the harmony of the dish the chicken was excellent um it was really really moist really juicy and tender and i think it's fantastic because it's on the bone and that's really where the flavor comes from i love the mint and coriander chutney jay you're a big lover of indian food it's my favorite cuisine is it really yeah i love it i love it tonight if you lose we're getting promised me a free meal i thought the pork was really it melted in the mouth it was cooked to perfection the crackling was lovely and then against the tartness of the apples and the sweetness of the leeks it was lovely the compaction was quite fatty the small crispy squares were quite fatty fat done very well but also you know there's a little bit too much of it really vibrant start in there jay's got off to a very confident composed energetic start keeping himself to himself but focusing on these flavors that dish is very very ambitious akhtar however has sort of he's come in almost lack of confidence which is a big change around for him but more importantly he started to communicate to his sous chef like he cares which is a really positive sign who's in the lead right now this is neck and neck welcome to you both you look amazing thank you thank you very much how are you i'm fine now java he seems to eat drink sleep breathe food is he workaholic he is here very much in fact i don't know how he does it but he does it well and i think that's largely supported by the amount of passion he has for food and what he does yeah jabba is making money at him so he's not particularly bothered about him being a workaholic do you have any concerns about the level of commitment that guy puts into his cooking there is concerns i always ask him to lighten up and you know either but i think that's his passion and that's where you get the best of actor but i've out of all this sport and i have to thank you he has changed he's he's simmered down he's calmed down i think he's more um he takes on you know positive criticism good luck thank you i'm pretty good thank you enjoy my course thank you jim my goodness me how are you feeling i'm feeling uncentered nervous incredibly excited everything he is very calm yet again in there what is it with this guy that cooks in that unassuming calm style i have no idea but i have to say he is looking incredibly calm today it looks like he's enjoying it today which is another thing yeah now what's he been like over the last seven days to deal with i finally asked a blessing would you love him more if he wins yeah really enjoy your main courses um and you both look great thank you very much thank you tonight i'm deciding the winner i'm gonna be judging jane actor's dishes by my highest standards and every dish they cook needs to do justice to janet's fantastic meat janet now uh great job thank you really good job the mangalyta pig is quite rare having had the royal berkshires and yeah i was excited about it i've never tasted anything well it was a real talking point in the valley because obviously they've never seen these pigs in our part of north yorkshire loads of people came to see them and when i showed them in the show they were really really popular yeah and they had great personalities they really did freddie what were the individual characters like a bit evil be serious so you got on well yes i did i bonded with them and they ran around very very fast and they're like rolling and mud they were very entertaining talking about the chickens wasted time oh no on rather talk to my cabbages and talk than come to a chicken or you the meat tastes great yeah but as an experience they're not that rewarding um beef extraordinary stuff dense delicious and quite a unique flavor i think that is because the animals run around a lot more they they've got their little short legs but they're out shy it was interesting in our valley because you could see the other cattle in the other fields munching away yeah and my textures were much more lively um again another amazing job yeah yeah from the chickens the pork and now the beef thank you it was really really worthwhile and i'm glad you enjoyed it because there would have been nothing worse than to go through all that nightmare and come up with me it was average yeah but it was coming to russians in the final you've made their life a lot easier producing fantastic meat like that thank you so much i've got a present for you you've got all ready this is a rug from one of the dexter's seriously it's a rug type saxon basically gordon so it's the kind of rug that people put in front of the phone the history of my cooking career i never thought i'd touch janet street porter's rug give me this thank you brilliant absolutely amazing job well done and exquisite produce ladies and gentlemen round of applause for janice reporter amazingly thank you well done thank you much appreciated thank you right can't wait to taste the pheasant starter it looks fantastic like the little mangalits of pigs been running around the back garden phenom very cheffy now the taste flavor's amazing you can really identify that pig is unique the brawn delicious you've got the crispness of the deep fried little beignets very earthy very dense and slightly sweet it needed that mustard mayonnaise to really sort of bring it together yeah they've done that mangalitsa very proud delicious really good i want to see what actors is like now he's got the chicken drum marinated smells amazing and the breasts sort of char grilled honestly i thought i'd see chicken tikka from aktar that's delicious i mean really good it's the kind of dish i'd expect aktar to come up with because it's it's packed with flavor it's very mellow very cleverly put together and more importantly it has great finesse from start to finish looking at both dishes this is a tough one because that is jay through and through and this chicken here is aktar through through which one do i prefer it's hard to call i like them both if i had to choose one i'd go for actor's chicken we've got 50 food critics out there i mean you get one or two at the restaurant and you just happen to find that and that's it you know you're all over the place and you know making sure everything's okay double checking everything triple checking everything i am a bit nervous but fingers crossed we'll do it every dish went out looks pretty let's just hope they want to try something different braun pig's head it's quite not controversial but hopefully they'll be brave if the diners don't like the starters they don't have to pay but it's still only a guide for me okay before i get the results okay from the dynasty i want to let you all know they are an indication at the end of the day it's my decision uh jay how you feeling there's a lot of ladies in the audience so um maybe it don't appeal to every lady but you know do not like ladies i know they don't like pork but i don't like popcorn yeah i love ladies out of 25 how old do you think you did i'd like to get 25 but 20 will be fine yeah brilliant actor you seem to have a lot more confidence this time around in terms of opening up and communicating where's that coming from all of a sudden through this experience obviously i've started to talk more and uh and we're talking back to each other so yeah it helped yeah you were having a conversation earlier all about the food how nice is that great change so out of 25 what do you reckon uh let's say 20 20. oh coffee then interesting uh jb these are the toughest dinos we've ever had trust me serious foodies with strong opinions okay let's start with pheasant the number of customers out of 25 that are happy to pay for your starter is [Music] 15 huh 15. not brilliant i'm not bad jb what do they like um the fun is very very well presented great in flavors 10 guests didn't enjoy the pork too fatty too fatty oh come on of course it's fatty right lassen the number of customers they're happy to pay for your chicken is [Music] 22 well done really good indeed 22 hours great start very good start what do they like chicken very tender tender chicken yes marinated beautiful um the marinade great great taste right jay i do not want to see your head go down now you bounce back 15 out of 25 yeah it's not a terrible score yeah yeah so stay with it yeah yeah yeah yeah actor great start don't let that go upstairs yeah you've each got 50 main courses to cook now yeah make it count yeah yeah well done yeah stay down let's get ready for the next course well done tonight we're going to be crowning the f words best local restaurant who's it going to be thousands of your favorite local restaurants were whittled down to 18. and now there are just two fantastic finalists [Applause] british russian the pheasant from cambridgeshire and indian wrestling from birmingham in the starter i was impressed by jay's ambition the train and pork belly both had great flavor but the brawn capacio was a step too far for some diners akhtar played its safe with his starter tandoori chicken with mint chutney it was delicious and definitely a popular choice but i would like to have seen something a little bit more adventurous in the end it's my opinion that counts tonight and there are still two courses to go so if jay wants to stay in the game it's essentially keeps calm and confident yeah that's tough that jay yeah yeah and the chef welders are kicking the balls but you got to stand stand strong up there yes absolutely yeah liam i don't want you dropping your head no chance yeah let's go right now both restaurants are gonna cook their main course first up the pheasant the pheasants hfj needs to stage a comeback with his main course he loves cooking with british meat and he's got ambitious plans for janet's decks to beef i like all the braising and all that sort of wintery stuff that's the food i like cooking and i love eating it as well check out one deck to three ways check out one dexter three ways please the pheasant's main course tonight is beef three ways with beetroot and horseradish puree mash and pickled red cabbage jay's recipe uses a combination of rib shoulder blade and bravely the heart we get the whole animal we use the whole animal for the shoulder blade jay fry's chunks of beef that'll be marinated in red wine with vegetables so you want to sear these lots of color keeping the juices in we then fry the beef with vegetables and bay leaves he returns the meat to the pan and leaves it to cook slowly with red wine and veal stock [Music] next jay slices the heart and grills serving heart is a real risk i think it can be delicious but it's not to everyone's taste the heart is so with pickled red cabbage beetroot and horseradish puree big bold flavors the earthiness of the beetroot and then the kick-ass heat of the horseradish next the river beef jay seasons the rib and fries adds butter yeah i like butter and it's going to give it good flavor and puts it in the oven to finish cooking for the sauce jay fry's finely chopped vegetables adds fried onion lardons and the cooked shoulder blade and its sauce this dish is classic j sophisticated comfort food with amazing attention to detail but it's very complicated makes life a bit harder but not supposed to be easy finally the mashed potatoes then j plates up this is hearty rustic food but the presentation's refined he adds the mushrooms a chunk of beef rib pickled red cabbage the beef shoulder and jay's big gamble nice piece of heart and finally the beetroot and horseradish puree [Music] dexter beat three ways served uh jay start off in olive oil you're basing with the butter get it all nice and sealed yeah and again you seem to love that way three ways well what are you gonna do with the heart put it in the bin yeah no not at all a lot of chefs will take the easy route and just cook it one way i love that level of ambition it's not supposed to be easy is it definitely not no not to become the f1 best local restaurant you're absolutely right okay actor you got six now after the six got four please yeah yeah chef we're good here's what la san are cooking tonight [Music] akhtar has complete confidence in the modern exciting food he serves up at lasan i'd say we're pioneers in that you know understanding indian food for what it is we've got food from south india we've got food from west bengal north india kashmir and pakistan so we've got india on a plate really when you dine at lasan [Music] masala beef table 14. thank you masala beef latin's main course tonight is masala beef with curried pumpkin and a cardamom scented sauce [Music] first act our marinade medallions of rump steak it's a light tandoori style marinade so it's a good all-round mix janet's put a lot of care and attention into uh ruining this wonderful meat for us and i think it's just a befitting end for us to take as much care as possible in uh cooking it up next akhtar makes the masala sauce with green cardamoms we grind all of our spices we make all of our own pastes so that's another thing that sets us apart to make the current pumpkin he heats mustard oil in a pan adding cumin and coriander seeds then he puts in garlic onion salt ground turmeric and chili along with chopped tomatoes actor adds the diced pumpkin and water [Music] once the pumpkin is soft he finishes with chopped coriander he fries the marinaded beef for a couple of minutes on each side just before serving he stirs in cashew nut paste once again akhtar shows real flair with his presentation masala beef with curried pumpkin and a cardamom scented sauce served and you're using the eye of the rum yes chef yeah i'm marinading first get married it's pretty light marinade and what we've done with the cashews have you toasted them uh dry toasted and then uh just splits down with a bit of water [ __ ] sake son how am i supposed to if this f is facing the customer am i going to put the beef behind them huh they said what they say yeah against the f against the f one o'clock one o'clock that's that's not one o'clock at three o'clock i do not have a watch yeah one o'clock yes the masala beef i thought was fantastic that it was a beautiful piece of beef it just melted in the mouth there was an explosion of taste particularly with the pumpkin traditionally you don't really see beef in curry dishes it was an incredibly good cut of beef and very very well cooked tonight's tonight yeah yes chef yours looks plain and delicious jay's looks refined well i've gone for plain and delicious because the battering you've given me over the last few months about about garnishing are you feeling less confident because jay's gone for me three ways not just the heart the blade you know and then the rib more isn't always uh better is it i like to say less is more so i'm hoping on lessons more today so you're confident these two things in the bowl tonight can beat seven things on jay's plate jay's got a fantastic plate i'm not going to say anything other than that because it is amazing i tasted it earlier on but most admiration for it but i'm hoping you know simplicity will win through i mean the fact the marriage of the uh the pumpkin with the cardamom gravy yeah and the way the beef has been uh marinated i'm hoping people will recognize that he took a lot of skill and uh understanding to put that together those two fantastic they smell amazing yeah again perfect yeah i come to them with the beef okay let's do it yeah yep uh beautiful i could lift that now and run down to royal hostel road and put it out on table seven it looks amazing good yeah really good the dexter bee three-ways was a wonderful uh plate full of um ideas i don't know if it quite came together as um as an overall dish next to three ways the different textures of beef were fabulous full marks i loved it this is amazing because jay's dish is very accomplished a very very difficult dish to pull off beef three ways very bold move not everyone wants to go out especially in the f-word dining room and eat heart beautifully grilled but it's clearly obvious he's putting his heart and soul on that plate actor started with such confidence yeah there's only three things on his plate this amazing cashew sauce spiced pumpkin and then a really nice eye of rib of beef so quite interesting he's calm very very confident but he's letting the food do the talking tonight which is which is refreshing upon apologize somebody please yeah yeah all right leaving a piece of clinvar on the plate is a sign that jay's really feeling the pressure i hope this is just a one-off mistake right seriously excited about toasting both main courses let's start off with the sand it doesn't look like the kind of dish should cook normally because it's just so simple but tonight is depending on the flavors rump done with a wonderful sauce with toasty cashew and a spiced pumpkin puree only three things on the plate there and they complement each other absolutely brilliantly well delicious if i've got one complaint in how aptar puts food together the base of the bowl is always coated in far too much sauce it doesn't need all that great flavors great balance j's look at it i mean it's beautiful glamorous and it oozes passion so the braised blade slowly cooked and reheated in the cooking juices taste that one first wow melts in your mouth the heart it's a shame you go from the braised blade of dexa's beef to the heart the beef and it doesn't hold the same kind of quality in terms of taste a little bit rubbery as well what a shame the rib lovely so two out of three things work unfortunately one that doesn't grab me is the grilled heart what a shame getting 50 dishes out was hard work you know each little piece of meat needed 100 attention we're in the final we wanted to win today you know we don't want second place at the moment it is it is very close i look at them and you know find similarities between us both ultimately it's gonna be chef's decision i think it's gonna be the toughest one for him so uh i feel sorry for chef i'm deciding the winner tonight but the diners opinions will help me make up my mind right uh how old do you think you did last time around the f-word kitchen 40 out of 50. paid tonight mid-40s chef mid-40s midfour is 45 out of 50. i'd like to see that i love that confidence it's oozing back in again isn't it yeah right jay uh well we need 50. yeah got to beat 36. yeah for my last one and then need seven on them so 45. jb please excellent thank you right that's them first yeah the amount of customers that happy to pay for your main course out of 50 is 39 out of 50. well done really well done really well done good very good indeed okay well done 3950 good score yeah jb what do they like um they love the pumpkin they love the pumpkin delicious spicy yeah the 11 people that didn't like it why um mainly because they said um the sauce was a bit bland the sauce is a bit black ready i thought it was delicious jay yeah pheasant loved the colors loved it work of art clearly now the number of customers that are happy to pay for your main course out of 50 is wow 28 out of 50. 28 out of 50. no what's all that about too complicated that's 22. yeah as well yes he didn't like the the heart they didn't like the heart what do you mean they didn't like the heart it was a heart salad yeah but maybe you should just put the heart in the bin then yeah and the meat slightly overcooked the meat slightly overcooked which one the uh i thought the dish was amazing loved the composition and to have the balls to stick a heart salad on a plate in the middle of the most amazing beef extraordinary yeah remember one thing tonight i will have the final say i've got a lot to think about yeah and you still got to cook 25 desserts each so make them perfect okay impress me impress the diners one final hurdle yeah yeah well done clear down let's go ready for dessert good next on tonight's menu can the brigades hold the nerf for the final showdown come on guys actually melting please please please ice cream's gotta go on last you could take that long put it on the plate yeah and i'll be facing one of the toughest decisions i've ever had to make who shall i crown the f word's best local restaurant the restaurant that has consistently delivered in every mark across the board is tonight it's the final in our search for the f word's best local russian we had ten thousand nominations we're down to the final two la san and the pheasant are battling out in the final to decide the epword's best local restaurant i want to be first i want the trophy there's only one place for us and that is winning it i'm going to decide the winner not just on tonight's service but how they performed throughout the past few weeks so far tonight jay's ambitious dishes have divided diner opinion but akhtar is playing it safe and his brilliance hasn't always shone through [Music] [Applause] the competition is neck and neck and heading into dessert there's everything to play for [Applause] this was the pheasant's strongest course in the british heat 23 or 24. but lasan have been less consistent with this course 12 out of 25. who's got the edge there's only one more course before i decide the winner guys final round yes everything's still yeah to cook for okay it can be won or lost on this course please focus go for it yeah jay actor good luck let's go last round 25 desserts here we go the pheasant's head chef jane had a tough time with his starter and maine tonight but he's hoping to pull things back with a french twist on a classic british apple pie what's the point of coming second there is no second you know you may as well you know be last it's you you've got to you've got to win check on one task check on one tart to tan please the pheasant dessert is tart to tan to start j pills and cause apples the apples you want to use are braeburn apples they're a firmer texture he lines the saucepan with sugar and leaves it on the heat to caramelise we've got a knob of butter just going to put in it makes it a bit richer it helps it get that sort of butterscotchy taste he lays the apples in a pan and lets the caramel darken next jay rolls out puff pastry if you roll the pastry too thin you get you don't get much of a rice keep it quite fat you're going to get a better rice he puts the pastry lid over the apples and places the pan in a hot oven for 15 minutes jay serves a dessert with a dusting of icing sugar and a scoop of vanilla ice cream the pheasant's tartar tan served jacob yeah you pull it back on this one in terms of numbers yeah yeah liam yeah yeah head up please be careful tipping them out in mid-air yeah guys yeah winning tonight means everything to actor and dessert is his last chance to prove himself to me i'm just zoned into winning and that is gonna be it it's gordon ramsay choosing the best local restaurant i mean dream come true for me doesn't sum it up i think that that's too blase and the words i can't find but i know what it means to me and i know how important it is to me and everyone around me knows how important because i've been an absolute bastard to be around for the last few months of parcel gents la sant's dessert tonight is half a parcels with strawberry coulee and vanilla ice cream act our cooks cassia bark cardamom pods and bay leaves in clarified butter half as a traditional north indian more so punjabi style of pudding he then cooks grated carrot until soft akhtar is brilliant at reinventing classic indian dishes but this harbour is a risk because it won't be to everyone's taste next actor pours in carrot juice and adds chopped cashew nuts chopped pistachio nuts and mixes the thing with this helper is you've got to continuously uh stir it and keep it moving otherwise it will catch and it will burn and that's the end of it then akhtar pours in cream milk and finally stirs in sugar [Music] he takes the puff pastry parcels and fills them with the halva mixture the parcels are then wrapped in silver foil and baked in a hot oven [Music] then octar plates up finishing the dish with ice cream and a strawberry half a parcel with strawberry coulee and vanilla ice cream served [Music] i'm trying to put that sauce on the plate first so the mouth screw doesn't melt i want the ice cream melting at the table yeah so not in the kitchen come on guys that's please melting please please please ice cream's gonna go on last you could take that long put it on the plate yeah go good let's go so ice cream on last guys yeah otherwise trust me first table five but three four tables down the line ice cream's gonna be pissing all over the plate yeah now the pheasant looks fantastic again two very lucky people getting to share this it's huge touch of ice cream tatan wow simplicity at its best rainbow apples puff pastry butter sugar delicious really nice the important part about putting this dish together is every little bit of technical ability has to be spot on now lassans however classic dessert spiced carrot wrapped in pastry baked in the oven smells very fragrant cardamom cinnamon pastry just a little bit doughy and slightly undercooked and it's not very sweet but it's not very spicy so the jury's out in that one i'm not entirely sure it doesn't blow me away if i had to choose between both of these desserts there's a clear winner by a mile and it's from the pheasant just when it looked like jay had lost his confidence he comes back with a winning dessert but tonight is down to me not the diners that choose a winner there's so much at stake here and i know just how much both restaurants really want this we're not prepared to go to go second yeah i don't want to lose i want to go first i don't want to go back home and tell all our staff that we lost so every point counts and there's only first place we want to win it and you know to a certain extent we have to win it that's the way we've put it to ourselves so it is important to us fingers crossed the dessert scores are in tonight i'm going to read them in private before making my decision about who deserves to win the f worth best local restaurant so desserts blimey uh that's a sharp lasagna out of 25. nine customers are happy to pay that's a big shock i knew the car was lacking in spice and slightly dull pastry undercooked however the pheasant scored 18 out of 25. that's a phenomenal performance on dessert for them and more importantly did they pull it back yes of course they pulled it back this is a very close call [Music] la sam is everything a great local indian should be and there are flashes of real genius in aktar's cooking [Music] the pheasant is a fantastic local restaurant great british food and a wonderful atmosphere two very talented chefs and based on everything i've seen and witnessed and tasted from both chefs there is a winner and one of them just edges it this has been a very tough decision in the making but i can put them out their misery and let them know [Music] before i give results for desserts yeah tonight's overall winner does not depend entirely on the numbers from the dining room they're a guide clearly influential guide and they're going to help me decide but i will have the final say on who wins the f words best local restaurant and here's the thing actor asan jay liam i'm taking every little ounce of detail into account what a journey for all of us you've done phenomenally well really well done jake how you feeling bit down why well rubbish scores the food delivered i mean really delivered absolutely delicious yeah great textures and visually yeah it had an impact really good good thank you actor how you feeling um i'm feeling a good chef it was a very tough challenge for us today because obviously uh beef is not something that we used to cook and we've had to create something for today's final so and that went down very well so that you know that's comforting now here are the diner scores lesson the number of diners that are happy to pay for your dessert out of 25 is nine desserts clearly well not your strong point jay the number of diners happy to pay for your dessert out of 25 18 out of 25 well done really well done really well done yeah yeah yeah really well done so lassan 70 out of 100 well done yeah well done that's good very good indeed jay out of 100 the fed has scored 61 out of 100 another good score well done to both of you seriously both restaurants did a fantastic job tonight but who is the f words best local restaurant this gentleman has been a very tough decision to make and it's not just about the scores it's from the start to finish round one secret diners turning up jumping in from a coach royal hostel road customer feedback numbers everything i have scrutinized the winner of the f words best local restaurants is [Music] the restaurant that has consistently delivered in every mark across the board is [Music] time [Applause] [Applause] an absolute pleasure having you in the kitchen now get out and get yourself an amazing drink well done well done well done well done well done [Applause] it's an amazing sensation oh god it'd be like the cheshire cat from now on i'm hugely proud of jay we're both incredibly gutted we're stuck to what the pheasant is about and um you know we got this far we've got to take the positives out of there you know i'm chuffed i'm suffering has an exciting and creative chef in akhtar and the standards of excellence i've been searching for in a local restaurant for me that's what this extraordinary competition has been all about finding that passion on every level i know actor feels honoured to lift the trophy tonight and i'm just as proud to name la san the winner

potato and beetroot gratin now i love hot pot you love hot pot and you love sausages right yeah what do you enjoy most about sausages um i just love having them with the baked beans sometimes with baked beans sometimes these are little button mushrooms okay you just take them into there like that and keep them whole and cut them into quarters please now the important thing about cooking sausages is they need a bit of color right no color no flavor exactly get the pan nice and hot how was school today school was good thanks we got to go out and make snowmen sausages in okay butter mushrooms in there please [Music] see now i want you to wash your fingers but you know how to slice onions right definitely i'll be good right now sausages are getting lots of color because this is going to cook slowly and it's sort of daddy's version of the kind of hot pot the other one nani's to make for me yeah once you've got the color on them and take them out to rest okay a little normal butter okay into the pan now it looks like a lot of onions right yeah as they start sweating down they caramelize so that will go down by half give that a little fry okay salt in i want you to put a nice tablespoon of brown sugar in there that gets them really nice and dark now get your thyme in pick off all the little buds that will get the onions packed with flavor that's kind of nice nice mushrooms in give them a nice little stir did you like to help them make your hot pot when she made them for you i used to always help them make the hot pot always now my mum would never have used this but a's balsamic vinegar brings out the flavor of the onions right now look at her onions look beautifully caramelized the vinegar has given that nice sort of gloss i'm going to put my sausages back in here now from there some red wine red wine end got the flavor underneath there going into the sausages now the sausage is going to release all that flavor inside as well look at the color of that does that look pretty cool and it's still not cooked yet up to the ball really important to boil it here because it won't boil in the oven 170 in the oven literally 18 to 20 minutes then she goes nice to go with my hot pot rich golden creamy potato gratin it's a true comfort food classic and i'm adding a delicious twist beetroot start by gently heating double cream [Music] then peel and thinly slice potatoes and cook beetroot next rub garlic around the edge of your dish to thoroughly season with a glorious flavor then grease with a good layer of butter arrange alternate layers of potato and beetroot seasoning in between end with a neat layer of potatoes and pour the hot cream over the top bake in a preheated oven for an hour or until the potatoes are tender [Music] potato and beetroot greton are bubbling beauty of a comfort food dish now for the apple compote what we need to do first is to get these peeled and sliced i get my pan on to get nice and hot now let me give you a little taste of that is this thanks for the warning you're both so well only blew my head off they're incredibly acidic okay and you need to cook them those wonderful red apples you've got are called brae burns what other apples do you know green ones what they called um i'm not too sure what the green one is another word for your nan grandmas no red no pink lady apple no granny smith granny smith apples that's right what we're gonna do is cook the cooking apples and the eating apples together i love the combination of the tartness from the brambley cooking apple with the sweetness of the braeburn get the pan nice and hot and sprinkle the bottom of the pan with caster sugar three or four nice slices of fresh ginger and three little cinnamon sticks i want you to remember that because we're gonna look for them okay because once we've used them and they've worked their magic i need to pull them out see all the sugar dissolving definitely now we just let that go a little bit darker

knows all about being thrifty in the home kitchen it's my mum god i love you i love you too now you're gonna help me cook dinner and give me some valuable tips on how to save money in the home kitchen right i will do you will do excellent see easy peasy [Music] for my ultimate thrifty dinner we're gonna make an amazing spicy braised oxtail followed by a deliciously juicy pudding chilli poached pears with star and east us now oxtail was something that we grew up with yeah there's something you can do in the morning and put it in the oven because it has to be cooked really really slow yes i'm gonna dust this in flour it's amazing how many chefs are using oxtail on their menus today it's incredible this is very popular it's very cheap as well it's amazing i used to make it stretch for like five or six dinners oh don't exactly it's not that bad now i know why we're all so skinny growing up it wasn't that bad i'm joking come on you know i'm joking you see sometimes we went to the beaches and you had maybe extra two or three i used to put in a saucepan and you had lovely stock for soup what was that spicy soup that really nice mulligatory tony and i used to make the good pot of scotch broth scotch broth i remember now i'll peel a couple of cloves of garlic i'll show you a quick word getting that out get your knife and just brush it nice no it's not a mess just peel them and i'll crush them in the garlic crusher okay all right oxtail in i'm gonna fry that off we can get that nice and brown and we've all braised it in red wine and sort of chicken stock before but i'm gonna get this done with a chinese influence the chinese absolutely love cooking oxtail you started cooking at home quite early on right 17 and a half 17 and a half your mum died quite young very young 26 26 so who taught you how to cook not to talk to you i think you just learn as you get older and you learn by your mistakes and did you enjoy it yes i did enjoy it yeah that was a nice vegetable the fennel panel isn't it that lovely it's beautiful yeah a lot of people don't use it a lot of them use it in salads but no one actually cooks it you just slice that up them now these are nice and brown they look lovely put the color on there you just slice up the chili okay just slice it down and keep the seeds in there because i want some heat as well and that's that star knees that's right yeah i wouldn't have thought i'd put that in there no no one thing you never used to do was work with many spices there wasn't many chinese influences i wasn't very adventurous with spices like me no i like ginger do you i love ginger especially fresh yeah coriander seeds a little handful tim yeah some soy sauce and quite generous in soy sauce four or five tablespoons that helps give it that saltiness and a nice dark rich color on the vegetables so as it raises the meat tenderizes quicker i would never drink fennel and the chilis and that smells lovely does that smell nice and then a little bit of this this is a what's up a rice wine vinegar is it yeah what other tips would you give me in order to save money on cooking what got you through that tough time feeding all six of us and holding two jobs when that was in the oven sea for about an hour and a half then i would think right i'll make a roast pudding i put an apple pie and for the same sort of heat use the other shelf in the oven so you weren't just watching the pennies in terms of the produce you also cut down the gas bill yeah wow super nab yes yeah so oxtail back on top of the vegetables gonna top that up is that beef stock yeah this is uh no a really nice chicken stock why are you putting chicken stock in it because it's quite a sort of light fragrant way of cooking oxtail because oxtail itself is quite rich yeah chicken stock's nice and light just cover it with stock lovely colorism a beautiful color little taste there we go big deep breath okay then well that's lovely i can taste the fennel in that is that nice that's lovely oh jesus damn water for nan [Laughter] take some water now this is water come on while mum recovers from the kick off the chili to go with my oriental influenced oxtail i'm going to knock up a quick fresh radish salad take a bunch of radishes and separate off the edible leaves once washed thoroughly place half the radishes in the bowl with the leaves chop the remaining radishes in half and add them too [Music] next peel and finally slice a banana shallot add them to the radishes and season with salt and pepper dress with a good squeeze of fresh lemon juice and a drizzle of olive oil then mix radish salad it's that simple next up dessert delicious poached pears i love pizza ready so we're gonna poach them with a little bit of chili chili never heard of that little bit of saffron no no now pan on take off a little slice like that so they stand up nicely and then peel okay then and then the chilli you hold that up and just go down yep through and open that up okay into the water seeds in as well a little bit of chilli water and sugar what are they holes saffron is expensive but you only need the tiniest little bit a little pinch to make that water go light and golden star in these how comes the chinese you've like sliced it at the end and it's not put in whole i want all that flavor coming out of the chili we're going to make the most amazing star in east dust sorry stars dust should get your star nice in there seed up and then in see all those little seeds yeah and then you start grinding a little teaspoon of ginger give it a nice mix thank you meg and that's gonna dust the top of the pears once they're cooked ryan get your pears drop them in [Music] there and that's what we're going to sprinkle mmm ginger and sternies wow the rice is that very good that's lovely isn't it so once they're cooked cool down sprinkle that over the top right have you guys got homework yes see you guys come back shortly thank you turn that down and let them pour okay bye thank you guys bye after an eight minute simmer our pair should be ready now just get your knife on put the knife through and see how easy the knife is so that means they're soft and cooked now you can leave them in that overnight two or three days all right and they just get darker and more beautiful the good thing about the cooking liquor is that you don't throw that away because you can use that again for re-poaching beautiful i mean they look impressive they smell delicious don't they [Music] look at the colors nice lovely isn't it because they're amazing and just smells delicious and then take your little star and east dust and just dust over look at that nice lovely now for my favorite part the oxtail wow look at that is beautiful hmm i'm just melts in your mouth doesn't it i love the way you see that just sliding down the bone there's no waste in that at all could you carry that to the table please then yes i will do lovely and i will grab that that is beautiful [Music] this is my ultimate thrifty dinner sumptuous slow cooked chinese braised oxtail with a light and peppery radish salad followed by gorgeous chilli poached pears with star and east

semi-final the pheasant retsina and simply thai at the pheasant in rural cambridgeshire i love their passion for their local produce and i was massively impressed by the sheer hard work and dedication of husband and wife team jay and tafita check on two covers two rabbits and at racine in london i was charmed by another family this time mother and son working together to create wonderfully authentic greek food as soon as our family business it's been going on for around 25 years i want razor to be known as the best restaurant in the uk and at simply thai in middlesex i tasted some of the best thai dishes i've ever eaten well calorie dynamo petraeurapan puts a heart and soul into running this place almost single-handedly she's remarkably talented i've got to pick the very best restaurant how by setting them all three very tough challenges for the first test i've hired a team of food experts to work undercover for me as secret diners i'm quite excited about this place it's a trick of the western trade i use all the time i spend a fortune on secret diners coming to all my restaurants it's a really good way to see how consistent a restaurant is on a daily basis hello i've got a table book yeah just two years yep i'm sending my secret diners to all three restaurants who have no idea they're being filmed i got a reservation um in the name of beth i have to find out how the restaurants perform when they're not in the spotlight and their guard is down this should be interesting whichever restaurant fails to impress me on this test will be eliminated first up the pheasant it's a great british restaurant where huntsman leave their wellies at the front door and they're killed around the back customers turn up and throw a brace a pigeon down or some mallard we trade off we might cook them a duck supper and that's payment for it really i hope my secret diner is in for a treat because i thought the service here was first rate could i possibly have the homemade black pudding please i've asked trish davis to go undercover today because she's an experienced food specialist don't like waiters when they lean on the table what wine would you recommend for me to have with my first clothes please of course yeah that's the black pudding um in comes the owner to the rescue rapidly the hellfire yesterday yeah good here we go i've asked trish to complain about the food even if it's perfectly cooked i'm ever so sorry but my potatoes are just slightly under cooked would you prefer math oh that's really kind of you know i'll just go with one go with them a bit more would you prefer mash again coming up with solutions all the time no negativity the secret is a great solution slow start and then it was brought back to life with taffeta good okay had a cena next up red cena in north london smells good anyway someone's been busy cooking that's what we're all about fantastic it's run by mother and son minos and zeta i'll go with the mitts kebab that sounds great they don't have a clue that my secret diner sam head has booked a table i've asked sam to chat to the staff to see how they engage with everyday customers oh perfect thank you very much so sorry nope [Music] he's not very attentive i keep trying to catch his eye i can't get him he's doing his best to ignore me [Music] i'm actually here because i went around the greek islands in the summer so it's a bit of a treat to try and reminisce ah that's the reason yeah they're talking about the authenticity of the greek isles just come back from the summer holiday and wow he didn't give a [ __ ] he's off looking out the window wasn't even engaging with the customers totally uninterested what a shame are you cooking um lovely to see out comes the chef bless her now you're having a lovely time thank you i'm chubby now i apologize that's how chef should smell onion guys how are you really good thank you we're having a lovely time thank you yeah thank you enjoy your cooking the saving grace there was zita's welcome little kiss on the cheek welcome good to see you and i've just come out of the kitchen and she looks like she's been busy which is fine simply thai so will my final target simply thai and teddington doing you better with just nine tables it's a tiny restaurant run by a tiny chef but betray has a hugely passionate temperament [Music] i feel like i met the female gordon ramsay from bangkok where is it where this is gonna be fascinating what's the reception gonna be here this lady scares me does say if you have a limited amount of time please let our staff know my last secret diner beth heald is about to risk the wrath by the thai culinary fire brand because i've asked beth to act as if she's in a hurry so we've only got about an hour is that going to be okay thank you very much what time do you have that's patriarch coming out of the kitchen almost sort of telling the customers off which we've only got an hour we are in we are in a little bit of a rush but um by nine o'clock and she looks like she just came out of a kickboxing competition i mean she's that she's ready for action the cod balls are still light and fluffy um really really tasty what shocked me more than anything was the i suppose the aggressive stance from patria coming up to the customer we don't do fast food granted but they only ask him we've got an hour we want to spend our money in your restaurant dear idea that's a great shame so it's time to eliminate one of the restaurants [Music] my decision is based on everything i've seen and learned so far including hours of invaluable undercover down evidence no one has any idea i've been spying on them but i have told them that one restaurant is about to be knocked out of the competition today is a big day i haven't felt this nervous since probably when we when uh tough and i got married i'm excited now looking at the clock all the time you know just when the phone gonna ring we hope that we will win again good afternoon the pheasant hi james gordon ramsay how are you hello gordon very well thank you good good good have you had a good week it all depends on what you say yeah the the secret of any good restaurant is in the consistency yep now unknown to you and taffeta we've had the f-word secret diners eating at the pheasants okay well as you know being shortlisted is a great achievement and you know i think you guys did phenomenally well right there's only two are going through to the semi-final yeah [Music] and the pheasant yep it's one of them congratulations james [Applause] i'm totally aesthetic you know it's best the best best news you know apart from my daughter's being born it really is i'm just you know i can almost cry my big tough mum the pheasant didn't put a foot wrong and quite deservely they now have a chance to win a place in the final we are through to the next round welcome back it's the semi-final of my best local wretched competition and three teams are fighting replacing the final only one will go through so far in tonight's second semi-final my best local british greek and thai restaurants have been put to the test we've only got about an hour is that gonna be okay i sent in a team of secret diners to investigate the contenders and the pheasant pass with flying colours [Music] they're still in the running [Music] but now i have to eliminate one of the two remaining restaurants be going out of the competition simply thai or at cena i feel quite confident i think i'm going to win this one as well i'm exciting now looking at the clock all the time you know just when the phone gonna ring [Music] good evening simply try hello now i've had the f words secret diners i had the f word secret diners eating in your establishment zita that food is amazing the important part in order to get 100 record is to make sure that you've got the service to match it the name of the game is consistency so red cena isn't going through unfortunately the secret diners felt that they were ignored by the waiter feel welcome when they come in for the first time we have to learn for our mistake take care zita thank you have a nice week thank you if i say that i'm not disappointed i will lie i am disappointed but i'm not going to let myself feel bad because some these things happen i'm upset that people came here and they didn't feel comfortable in my restaurant and you know that's not good enough and simply ty congratulations the feedback from the f-word secret diners has been extraordinary so congratulations pretty well done and i can't wait to see you in the semi-final oh thank you so i've chosen simply tie from teddington to fight it out with a pheasant from cambridgeshire [Music] to be worthy of a place in the grand final they have to survive two more challenges first i've asked 30 f-word diners to test the pheasant and simply tie to breaking point and i'm going to judge both restaurants performance more critically than ever before we're going to have lunch at the pheasant and then dinner at simply thai your feedback is absolutely pivotal to helping me make my decision on which two restaurants go through the actual final so basically today you're actually my eyes and ears across that dining room so be upfront honest vocal and really give me your opinions in terms of what you think not just on the food from the minute you enter that dining room with the pheasant under intense pressure i'm going to watch like a hawk front of house and behind the scenes in the kitchen i know this is every russian's worst nightmare 30 diners all arriving at once so in terms of the menu we've stuck to what we do at the pheasant i'm feeling excited confident yeah we're good to go i'm going to test the team to the limit and if jamie's staff support each other today it should run light clockwork on a personal note i just want to say really well done for making it this far two hours to cook for 30 guests they're not here just for the food it's everything the warmth of welcome make sure that every plate you send jay you're happy with if you're not happy with don't send it make this now the service of your lives [Music] so the cartridge and the hair straight away i can see the front of house staff are creating a good first impression your service is friendly attentive again and everyone's little busy bodies running around making sure that bread butter water and constantly observing which is always nice the vibe in the restaurant is really nice um really cozy and quite a warm feel to it two covers one halibut one pork chocolate sponge and a brulee yes yeah the first table up now it's it's all going okay it's all good all the orders in here all the orders are in everyone is done we've only been here 20 minutes and my diners are enjoying their starters that smells amazing lovely big hit big hit yeah it smells delicious it's really good how's the beef excellent beef um beautiful flavors the flavours just work really really well together very happy with my dish yeah jay's a very controlling chef very hands-on he's at the sort of central point on the hot plate and everything comes up to him so he misses nothing everything's scrutinized overseen tasted as well a good sign so far so good but i'm worried about jay's main course he's cooking hair three ways with hair wellington lasagna and bray's leg all on the same plate you eat it it's [ __ ] hard it's [ __ ] [ __ ] it's a dish which requires very precise timing and i think jay's misguided to try and offer this to 30 diners all at once these weddings in the shirt they've uh they've just sat like that and the juices have made the pastry go all soggy so they're just rubbish hair's difficult enough to cook cooking it three ways that's ambitious jay's got somewhat backed up in the kitchen cooking it three ways that's like putting that noose around your neck so i just hope he hasn't bitten off too much that he can actually do and the brigade can execute because right now he's in the [ __ ] [ __ ] one day that [ __ ] matters and we can't do it [ __ ] properly [ __ ] rubbish jay has to start the hair from scratch we should leave some of my diners waiting for their lunch uh this one's 100 better yeah the pastry is still soft sorry still crunchy okay hair sauce but when it does reach the table the hair three ways is a resounding success it's just really really succulent really really soft didn't even have to cut it with a knife very tunneling flavors nice hearty tasty food very nice but just as i think jay's back on track there's a problem with the pudding do you want me to take it away i'm gonna go and find out what earth they're up to just asked if actually the pudding which is written as um hot chocolate sponge is i think it's hot chocolate sponge with orange and unfortunately i don't think the um hd really knew that either jay didn't mention the menu that the pudding is orange flavored and it's left a taffeta to deal with his mistake do you know there's orange in the pudding chocolate orange okay feeling pissed off service we didn't work together like i said it was [ __ ] the wellingtons were crapped as well it wasn't cooked properly you know it it just didn't wasn't it was you know it's not good enough despite a couple of issues most of my 30 diners really enjoyed their lunch you got coffees ordered in your room every table sorted and the food was very good indeed but jay's timing today was in danger of compromising the entire service tough challenger yeah 30 guests all arriving at the same time i thought you'd cope brilliantly well walking in and seeing food like that the salmon and it looked amazing tasted fantastic so job well done if i've got one concern cooking hair jay is a very difficult thing trying to cook it three different ways yeah yeah is you know on the verge of you know over ambitious this jay taffeta was a tough challenge today but well done really well done and i mean that thank you i look forward to seeing you the next challenge bye guys thank you overall my diners leave feeling satisfied with their meal but jay knows the performers in the kitchen was far from flawless disappointed pissed off angry i think jay is being incredibly hard on himself i have to say i don't think that it was as bad as he thinks it is he is just being absolutely meticulous on every single which of course you should be but the food came out looking fantastic i was very pleased to serve it next stop dinner at a restaurant that couldn't be more different simply thai and teddington 57 year old head chef petraea runs this place almost single-handedly i'm everything chef accounting bookkeeping managing director cleaner everything when i first ate here the food was stunning so i hope petra will serve exquisite cuisine tonight hello how are you ladies welcome first of all congratulations thank you really well done now you know there's only two restaurants that are going through to the final so tonight yes has to be your best ever service two hours yes two hours starting from now off you go right off you go out to the front now the menu you got all your best dishes on there yes yes yeah okay you got the sea bass yes i've got the zebras then they've got the chicken penang you've got all the chicken they've got all the sauce right look at the prawns it got asparagus okay but but trey will be under pressure and i'm worried this could be a test too far for her tiny restaurant which is now full to capacity so you're on your own um i was on my own but i got in where's my girl who's in the kitchen with you bonnie has she explained in the dishes to you yes what are the starters is that to him no not you [Music] yeah you're doing this on purpose aren't you to give me an ulcer pretty nervous for petraeus i mean she's got no help in there she's on her own two courses each 30 days that's 60 dishes in two hours cooking on your own how's he gonna cope with this one i don't know [Music] the waitresses don't know how to handle my 30 diners and immediately everything's chaotic you take all the food no two person take the drink so it's been 10 minutes now not one order in the kitchen what's going on outside [Music] we've been here for a quarter of an hour and the kitchen's only just kicked into action one quail one spring rolls now please laura watch your hands come here as the orders come in all at once laura the kitchen porter is commandeered as sous chef one spring rolls one smoke clothes spring rolls cycle beach open in it petraeus spring rolls are by far the most popular choice of starter enjoy one more spring roll now please i got another three spring rolls left after this one only three spring rolls left [Music] table three table three half an hour gone are you served four tables hold on a minute look come here somebody didn't listen to me i haven't got any more i don't have enough spring rolls i told you i don't have spring rolls for table two and table four just go and apologize to them ask them to something else now now they're selling food they haven't gone she's running out of spring rolls they told them that 15 minutes ago but no one's listening to her and the food's coming out it looks immaculate and the customers are happy with the food but it's about to go tits up we waited quite a long time for our starters to come out and when it came it's amazing really really good food so we can't really halt the food at all it's just i think it's the actual volume of people arriving at once maybe putting a bit too much pressure on the kitchen table seven i apologize sorry we are late turn up no put it here leave it there in the chaos dishes are being sent out before they're even finished where is the front where young [ __ ] the plan is not finished yet excuse me yeah it's not ready yet laura don't do it again okay i feel much safer on the [ __ ] bus than i do in there um so sad we're halfway through an hour to go and she's only got two main courses out so she has to keep it together she can't talk she's getting frustrated and she's getting flustered and it's such a shame because when the food arrives the diners love it so far the service is nothing short of disastrous but at least petraeus food is amazing it looks fantastic simply thai this has gone fancy thai no it's simple table one that's more complex than my food [Music] oh my god that's delicious that's good you seem to have got some rhythm going on now main courses are flying out table two concentrate don't make mistake please please table two petraeus finally seems to be settling down and there's some semblance of order i had the chicken penang for the main course i thought it was absolutely fantastic it's a shame about the weight but the food and the flavors for me was absolutely delicious if she can sort out the front of house service and maybe get somebody else in the kitchen and i think this restroom will definitely go places right well done you finished and you finished with just over five minutes to go five minutes ago oh that's brilliant well done i thought i'm gonna collapse in the middle of the night no no we're not gonna make it i didn't i said at one point i said in my mind you know in my head no we're not going to make it we're not going to make it we're not going to make it it's a really good job and i'm very proud thank you very much i'm really proud well done thank you i've done at the top of my ability today and um you know and i've got through it the big difference across all the semi-finals is that every other restaurant has cooked for 30 customers this is fully booked for her they've all got 60 70 80 90 seats she never does 30 kills so not only has she managed to do 30 covers within 2 hours she's done it single-handedly amazing thank you for supporting me [Music] next my two contenders will face the ultimate challenge cooking at my three-star flagship restaurant the biggest test is still in front of them who's going through the final right now i haven't got a clue welcome back to the f-word simply thai and the pheasant are fighting out for a place in the final tonight two semi-finalists have already faced two daunting tests under pressure in their own restaurants i'm seeing their true colours at the pheasant jay is a perfectionist check on two covers two rabbit he's passionate about game and awful and obsessed with fresh local produce creating dishes from the same day's kill i love offal it doesn't have to cost a fortune to be good food and you know we're finding customers do love it but i've also seen jay dejected [ __ ] one day that [ __ ] matters and we can't do it [ __ ] properly a simple setback can knock his confidence and affect his performance service we didn't work together like i said it was [ __ ] the wellingtons were crap as well it wasn't cooked properly you know it just didn't wasn't it was you know it's not good enough i want to see jay bounce back with a bit more vigor when things go wrong [Music] at simply thai patriaripan is one of the most dedicated chefs i've ever met simply thai no that's accomplished thai cooking um yeah i mean a real thoroughbred i mean my god that woman's passion her absolute commitment to a tiny restaurant is remarkable table three please table three but petraeus fierce independence worries me even the greatest cooks need support from their staff bonnie has she explained in the dishes to you yes what are the starters oh dear uh patria you're doing this on purpose aren't you to give me an ulcer and if petraeus gonna make it into the grand final she needs to work with the team not just operate single-handedly now both restaurants face the ultimate challenge here at my own flagship restaurant royal hospital road in london [Music] jane petraeu must create and serve exquisite cuisine worthy of a place on the menu at my three mission style restaurant they're cooking one dish the most important dish of their entire lives and with that one dish they've got one final chance to prove themselves i'm sure i'm not going to ever have three stars so given the opportunity here to cook it's going to be brilliant i'm really looking forward to just want to get started to know that golden led allowed me to cook in his kitchen i feel very honoured and very nervous at the moment getting very excited as well [Music] i've worked for over 10 years to build royal hospital road's reputation and tonight i'm putting it on the line and i've invited some distinguished guests including jason atherton who was awarded a michigan star within a year of opening maze i know how tough he is i've worked for 10 years you don't get going around to semi-final unless you're a damp cup so credit to them both right first of all welcome really good to see you now this is where it really seriously matters okay 10 years i've had this place yeah i had to rent for five years in order to save my pennies to buy each and every brick it's been a dream come true this but it's the first time in ten years i've ever handed my ration to any other chef this is it the final hurdle make this the best dish of your cooking career one of you is going through the final really good luck yeah off you go the teams are working in one of the most well-equipped kitchens in britain with the finest ingredients money can buy i've challenged both chefs to create one dish using the best quality cornish beef which i've provided it's been matured on the bone for a month and the meat is succulent with a beautiful even marbling okay jay first take it in four cups away table one four fill it of beef the pheasant yeah excellent thank you nice loud call thank you second table in patria yes chef four comes away table four four b penang yes chef so eight for his dish tonight jay has pushed the boundaries yet again he's serving beef fill it with veal sweet breads and bone marrow bon bons leave a hole yeah like that a little bit less spinach it's an incredibly daring choice because it's a very rich combination of flavours and offal isn't to everyone's taste jay rolls these fillets of beef into cylinders and base them with butter until they're pink in the middle jay coats the bone marrow bon bons in flour egg and breadcrumbs and deep fries them he soated the veal sweet breads in butter for five minutes and then jay serves the dish with parsnip puree fondant potatoes and a rich red wine borderlay sauce three complex elements on a plate can get you into three times the trouble if jay loses his concentration or confidence for even a minute he'll ruin the meal only one of us are going through to the final today um you know we want that to be the pheasant i want it liam wants it to be you know we're going to do the best we can you know we want to win you're using the phillips a little bit of phillip yeah yep um sweet breads you just like blanched this sweet breads we've yeah

quite complex very very rich beef philip veal sweet breads bon bons made out of bone marrow uh yeah this could go completely tits up if he's not careful [Music] service please quit double one please let's go [Music] i am so chuffed that we have got to the semi-finals i feel like you know it's anyone's game from here so we could win i love the presentation i love the palm fondant the cleverness in doing the bone marrow bonbon i thought that was inspired um i also thought that it wasn't a dish you ever got bored of you know sometimes you eat something and you get a third of the way through anything where am i going to go now this one was a whole sort of map of excitement in stark contrast with jay's earthy flavors petraeus has chosen a dish with a complex combination of sweet spicy salty and sour taste i would love to win because we are quite close now i would love to be in the final it would mean a lot to me this is a traditional thai panang beef curry with authentic thai sun-in-law eggs cucumber and pomelo fruit salad with lime and coriander dressing petraeus seals the thinly sliced sirloin steak in oil she drains it and adds it to warm coconut milk she makes the traditional panang curry paste in advance to allow the herbs and spices to infuse she fries in sunflower oil until fragrant and then adds coconut milk and the beef petraeus serves the curry with a quail egg salad and coconut rice there are so many flavors here the spicy curry paste and the sweet coconut the sour lime and the salty fish sauce patria needs to balance them out with immaculate precision or the dish just won't work now just tell me about the dish very very quickly i'm going to do the beef penang and use the sirloin beef yeah yeah put some fat in there as well yeah yeah a little bit it's got a little bit of texture and that's a curry paste that curry paste yeah do you think this dish is good enough to beat the pheasants yes of course it's curry dish it's much more um stronger flavors and a much more interesting dish right have you heard of the pheasants and yes or no i love freshly no not pheasant the bird pheasant the restaurant pudding that isn't the restroom i'm bending down you're bending down low it's harder to come down we'll be down on the bench if i bend down as a torture not for you to bend down even more standing up jesus are you confident with the recipe yes yes i am sir okay good yeah i've worked over the last 22 years to get what i have today in this industry all of a sudden um i allow a mad thai lady to run around in my kitchen i thought she'd be a little bit intimidated coming here to be honest but no this is not a lady that's been cooking like this for the last you know eight to ten years she's been like this the last 35 to 40 years and for her it's all about the food the love and the passion she puts into the dish patra yeah chef you have to clean around the side of the bowl yeah make sure that you [ __ ] sake you have to get a little bit more finesse a little bit yeah so i'm not gonna send those two until the two are ready yeah why does nobody take that because i want to wait till all the four dishes are completed yes yes yes chef thank you service please you said the rest is coming this is very very hot it's delicious very hot the combination of the beef pan and the rice is quite nice but just slightly strong it has some exciting speed for my taste but overall i think it's very good quite sweet but uh you know absolutely full of flavor exactly i was expecting rice cooked perfection i think patria has what it takes to win this competition yes because she's very very determined she she's absolutely crazy about her restaurant and if somebody can win that then it is going to be her if petraeus is going to be my winner tonight i wanted to start communicating with me and a sous chef nong no full salad not 10 12 14 just four yes petraeus dish comes with a salad which needs to be served alongside the curry it's only four salad not eight yeah so don't don't do no she i've told her to do just the egg chef because we got four already because it takes time no i only need four salad not eight yeah okay it's only four portions away you're not yeah only four yeah only four two four six eight ten twelve there's only four only four only four yeah sure only four canal honestly i mean she just relaxes a little bit and opens up and at least talks to nong blank me i'm fine but at least talk to your sous chef you know it's like we're back yeah in teddington again in the sort of nut house uh unbelievable oh jay was overcooked that beef it's not overcooked it's just smaller than the others so consistency jay i'm watching everything you know that yeah everything yeah start to finish chef when i first met jay

service please last time we had table for you go please table four one on j one on lamb thank you well done well done well done so service is over and it's time to discover the truth of my distinguished guests in terms of the dish cooked from the pheasant how was that i loved it absolutely loved it yep it's not something i perhaps normally choose off a menu but it was just so nice the sweet breads in particular were fantastic yeah there's so many different flavors in there all very distinct but together superb yeah the boys have done me very proud i'm really pleased with it it tastes gorgeous the presentation was fantastic and i don't think it's out of place in a three-star michelin restaurant was that authentic beef banana i've eaten in a lot of fantastic type restaurants and that for me was as good as as good as it gets curry wise it was just a shame just like the touch of sweetness just lost that bit of authenticity but in general that's great i preferred to thai dish today absolutely the flavors were amazing it was just the right heat for me the salad the lime and coriander coming through it was very very fresh and it just brought out the ingredients yeah it's went well yeah i i i'm happy with the food that i cooked i'm happy with the side dishes i'm happy with the rice i'm happy with the presentation i think it went really well i think it went yeah no really good um happy with everything you know um i didn't get in the mood um all smiles now i'm not nearly crying um so yeah no i think it was really good yeah good service [Music] only one russian can go through to my grand final and tonight who stays and who goes is my decision it would be disappointing you know to to get out of this stage not to go into the final it would be very very disappointed because um i you know i cook my heart i put everything in you know in into this competition i think we have done enough to you know i go away going that dish was good authentic thai curry done brilliantly against a a british flair with an amazing level of control and a very talented chef right now honestly it's too close to call welcome back to royal hospital road i'm about to choose one restaurant to go through to the grand final of my competition to crown the f word's best local restaurant will it be the pheasant from cambridgeshire or simply thai from teddington in very different ways they are both exceptional restaurants before i make my choice i'm going to taste the dishes cooked here tonight by jay and patria beef plane simply thai authentic got slightly nervous when she was putting all that sugar into the pan is it too sweet my god is absolutely phenomenal a proper authentic thai curry i mean it's sweet instantly then you've got the heat with the chilies but it's instantly cooled down with that wonderful vibrant cucumber salad incredible i mean really incredible she's she's a freak of nature that's the most bizarre thing i mean i've come across amazing thai chefs in my time but this woman not only driving around the bend but she is an amazing talented chef the pheasant's fillet of beef sweet bread bon bon a bone marrow and a fondant potato that is accomplished unique cooking at its very best all together does it work hmm my god that's amazing pasta puree wonderful beef delicious spinach bone marrow that's a little bit gimmicking i didn't think jay would be into gimmicks however it does work so it's the moment of truth two outstanding restaurants but only one can win a place in the grand final okay first of all well done both restaurants absolutely brilliant the feedback has been extraordinary this has been the toughest semi-final so far simply time brilliant again patria in the corner slicing the sirloin ignoring everything i'm saying and just in the food what strikes me about the way you cook is that you cook from the heart i thought the dish was stunning it was authentic i closed my eyes and i ate that dish and i felt that i was back in thailand if i had one criticism it was a little bit too sweet the pheasants tonight's performance was much different than i expected i thought you were going to play safe but jay you came out your comfort zone brilliant absolutely brilliant edgy daring for me that was you showing off tonight the filler beef yes it's the rolls-royce cut so it didn't need much work but it needed accurate cooking the fondant not easy to get crispy and delicious and then the bon bon absolutely delicious it was a foodie heaven done with charm but flair one piece of criticism is the fact that the sweetbread was slightly undercooked in the center i'm looking for one restaurant to go into the final and it's been a real tough decision based on everything i've seen the restaurant going through to the final is the pheasant congratulations absolutely brilliant [Music] i am so proud of both of you i feel absolutely you madam across this search you're one of the best chefs that i've found thank you really well done come here really well done to come this far and um i couldn't get to the final um a little bit disappointed but i i prepare a little bit you know we may not get it very happy probably you know i don't give much weight but i am really really happy both freshmen produced food worthy of royal hostel row tonight but ultimately i was in awe of jay's ambition he was prepared to take a huge risk and it paid off thank you very much absolutely brilliant yeah done with great flair today the pheasant reached new culinary heights if anyone tells me again that this is a little pub in the middle of nowhere there's cooking playing simple food no tonight you've proved everybody wrong really well done they deserve to be in the final now make it yours well done [Applause] so the pheasant from cambridgeshire is up against la sam from birmingham in the grand final both will cook meat provided by janet's farm in yorkshire and i decide who should be crowned the f word's best local restaurant jay's gone for beef three ways now let's say less is more that smells delicious tonight you know that i could lift that now and run down to raw hostel road

here do you know what the longer the better cover that oh my glim film wash your hands excellent good job ideally marinate your wings overnight but half an hour will be enough to get the flavors going [Applause] right so they've marinated now if you take the tray out people bottom one thank you and then we're gonna put some tinfoil on there thank you so pop that in half it stops them from sticking and that will stop the wings from burning so from there get them really dipped in that marinade and try and get the wing like that and just sort of scoop it no like that so get that really nice glaze on there and then just yeah so that garlic will roast and we've got all those wings beautifully done i can make them ready for the oven 170 25 to 30 minutes yep good man excellent nice it's hot wings are in right to go with my ultimate southeast asian dinner rice cooked in homemade thai green curry paste for the easy green curry paste roughly chopped coriander lemongrass green chilies lime leaf shallots garlic and ginger add lug of oil and blitz the paste takes minutes to make but it'll keep for up to 10 days if covered with oil and stored in a sealed jar in the fridge to awaken the flavors

veg to create a fantastic meal in minutes right now for the green beans beans in uh bring the water to the ball what's the first thing i should put in there beans salt salt so nice pinch of salt in there yeah so make an amazing dressing two nine tablespoons yep of a crunchy peanut butter please why is it crunchy it'll give it texture and it'll be nice and sort of chunky green beans in okay got the rice green beans we're gonna blotch them for two two and a half minutes what does blanching actually mean blanching means sort of part cooking okay i'm gonna blanch them in boiling water yeah and then finish them in the pan use the back of the spoon a little bit easier a teaspoon of brown sugar and she goes nice is that a little bit too thick maybe yeah it is let's put a little touch more soy sauce in there let it down yeah yeah much better touch some vinegar nice i'm going to get a pan on now for my beans so i'll taste did you taste it it's so good oh man hmm wow so have you got the garlic like that i'm going to slice the garlic down like this keep the knife nice and flat that way you'll slice through it but take your time don't worry about the speed and technique right first just cut it in half okay your fingers good and then lay the flat side down so it's nice and sturdy and that nail there it's not out like that it's just guiding the knife so you can never cut yourself like that good i'll drain the beans nice a little tablespoon of oil get the pan nice and hot and throw the garlic in people good nice mmm so first smell that already is that lily so give that a little toss so when you toss it push it down push away and pull back okay have a little go push it down and gently take your time nice so push down and pull back up that's it nice so it's getting nice and golden brown green beans i've drained and they go in now to the garlic combination of green beans okay with the rice i don't know it's not about oh wow i want you now spoon the dressing release and she goes nice how delicious does that look wow what's daddy's policy at home no waste no waste no waste but now smell that now oh wow it doesn't smell like green beans it smells like what is this oh thanks how nice is that lovely amazing right that's the rice that's the green beans [Music] now i want you to sprinkle some toasted sesame seeds on top please nice and generous with a sesame seed i'll give the beans a little bit of a crunch now all that's left for your favorites to come out don't those beans smell amazing jack look at those beauties one for me one for you three for me one for you i'd like you to sprinkle some spring onions on top please nice and generous you transformed a very cheap and cheerful chicken wing yeah right you take them over please do not drop them okay jack let's go but nice this is my ultimate simple southeast asian dinner sticky spicy chicken wings thai green curry rice and fantastic beans with chili peanut dressing guaranteed to get the fussiest of eaters into greens made with fantastic chicken cooked using a classic but simple french technique this is my ultimate home-cooked french dinner first job my chicken fricker say tilly would you mind helping daddy with the chicken fricassee please we're going to start off with browning all the chicken off nicely pan on get that nice and hot what i want you to do for me first is to season the chicken with salt and pepper please thank you so that's on one side then we turn the chicken over so we season it on the other side salt good girl and pepper nice now this is almost like a chicken stew okay what's that there [Music] um time time good girl what's that one there that one's real that's right rosalie and because this is quite a rustic french dish we don't need to chop everything so you get the garlic and you just bash it like that now smell mmm that's right so that's nice and hot put a tablespoon of olive oil in there a couple of plugs one two good girl put the chicken in it and you lay away you're like nice and brown i'm getting good at this you are skin side down so we got the color on the skin now i just want you to cut the mushrooms in half the belly please okay these are chestnut mushrooms there are lots of different types of mushrooms out there there are lots and lots of different types of mushrooms one of my favorites is the giro mushroom i like mushrooms that are a bit bigger than this and um some dinners with mum we cut out the middle put pesto and cheese in it and then we bake them uh-oh i want you to sprinkle the pancetta over the chicken please good girl nice put the mushrooms in not yet because i'm gonna get some color on the chicken first okay and as that pancetta starts to cook down it puts a really nice flavor on the chicken so we're sort of soating everything okay right garlic in please good girl just throw them in and i want you to sprinkle the mushrooms on top of that good girl and then there's the rosemary you can get your fingers like that and you pull it down you take it all off hold it put it down good girl so now you've got the nice little rosemary sprigs and we do the same with the thyme now the thyme flour is a little bit smaller what different flavors do they give so the thyme is a little bit sweeter okay and the rosemary a little bit more savoury which ones you like i like them both because they both get a nice smell don't they so bay leaf in i'd like you to put that rosemary and thyme in there please lovely sprinkle it over right i'd like you to stand back now because we're going to flambe this i do not want to get those little slippers caught on fire what are the names rampa and judy judah nice okay great ready yeah in with the brandy and then just tilt the pan gently whoa whoa how cool is that magical beautiful bit like a cauldron all the cognac has been flambe so there's no raw alcohol anywhere so we've got a really nice deep rich flavor i'm going to add my chicken stock you know rampo likes that not my slipper rump or run for the dog ah rumple the dog well he likes chicken stock yes when he's a good boy he gets some he gets it in his um with his biscuit it's gone in like wow really quickly simmer and reduce the stock for around 10 minutes now we're gonna cook the most amazing potatoes soda potatoes are really simple to make and absolutely delicious start by slicing the potatoes into finger whipped pieces then parboil them for five to six minutes when you cook something like rosemary or thyme or basil does it slowly let off the flavor into the bottle very much so in a hot pan add a tablespoon of goose fat and saute the potatoes until they turn golden and add in shallots garlic rosemary and thyme that goes in over top and that goose fat now is starting to fry the potatoes you just leave that sat there to complete my ultimate french dinner my version of a classic a glorious lavender creme caramel for dessert the first job is the lavender sugar you can buy this ready-made or simply add dried edible sprigs of lavender to caster sugar and store you can also try this trick with vanilla pods and cinnamon to bring new subtle flavors to sweets and bacon [Music] for the creme caramel melt plain caster sugar until it turns dark golden pour into ramekins sprinkle with lavender flowers and cool now to make a simple custard gently heat whole milk in a pan until steaming meanwhile whisk together egg vanilla seeds and lavender sugar until golden and fluffy then gradually pour the hot milk into the mix whisking continuously until the custard is smooth and creamy to set cook in a water bath or bamberry a good tip is to line a roasting tin with a cloth to stop the ramekins jiggling around pour your custard then boiling water around the ramekins until halfway up the sides then cook in a preheated oven for around 30 minutes until set cool in the fridge then when you're ready to serve dip the ramekins in hot water to loosen the creme caramel [Music] lavender clean caramel [Music] look at that chicken now so i'm just gonna turn the gas right down and put the lid on just like that but leave a little bit so it can let out some stuff so i can let out some steam that's right now what i'd like to do is to chop daddy some parsley crunch it up nicely tuck your fingers in and take your time [Music] now my hands have got lots of different flavors all those wonderful flavors you could almost be french sprinkle that on there good girl nice messy boku i can tell jack's going to love this is he looks the nest doesn't it smells delicious look at that i could smell that even before you took the lid off let's kill my darling good job by the way thank you i can't wait for the others to try it i hope that i love it this is my ultimate french dinner chicken fricassee with sensational herbie sauteed potatoes and lavender creme caramel the main course will be a crispy big caesar salad but the first job are my peanut butter and jam cookies [Music] start with a cookie dough simply combine muscovado sugar peanut butter and butter until light and fluffy then add your egg a splash of milk vanilla seeds and beat again until smooth sift together salt baking powder and flour [Music] then mix until thoroughly combined [Music] in floured hands roll the cookie dough into golf ball sizes flatten and create an indent with your finger fill with half jam and half peanut butter place the cookies on a tray lined with baking paper and bake in a preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes cool before serving [Music] next job main course and my take on an iconic american salad first made almost a century ago caesar salad is definitely a classic but the trick to keeping dishes like this modern and relevant is to tweak them but not lose what made them brilliant in the first place here's my version for the ultimate american lunch my first twist is in the dressing for me the most important part of the caesar salad is that dressing rich creamy slightly spicy begin by making a basic mayonnaise start off with the egg yolks in just a little spoon dijon and then a little splash of red wine vinegar start whisking once you've got that nice slightly thickened texture drizzle in your olive oil it should fall through your whisk it's like a nice thick double cream texture beautiful now take the mayo to another level with anchovies and crushed garlic now chop up the anchovies and the garlic together so we almost want that to be like a really nice puree then grated parmesan lemon juice that will make the dressing citrusy lighter in color and then a little splash of water in now all of a sudden it transforms that mayonnaise into an amazing delicious light dressing nice next job the croutons and i like using crusty bread for extra crunch and just dice up your bread season with salt and pepper then add to a hot pan with olive oil and fry give that a really nice toss as the croutons start to turn golden simply grate on a generous amount of parmesan cheese keep them rolling around stop them from sticking together look at that really nice cheesy delicious crouton and now they're out now for the fun job assembling the caesar salad starting with romaine lettuce and don't slice the lettuce too thinly a squeeze of lemon on with half of that gutsy anchovy mayo dressing saving some to coat your chicken later then sprinkle half your croutons give that a really nice mix salad in it's all beautifully dressed add the remaining croutons and finish with a good grating of parmesan cheese that for me is a perfect caesar salad however i'm gonna take it to another level and grill a stunning chicken breast start by preheating your griddle pan then butterfly your chicken breast simply slice from the thin end towards the thick bit of the breast let the knife do the work and literally just open up now that's how we butterfly a chicken breast so therefore it will cook twice as quick and just nice and moist in the center season the chicken on both sides with salt and ground pepper lay your chicken breast onto the grill [Music] never oil the grill until absolutely ready to cook your chicken now turn them over [Music] beautiful cook for three to four minutes on each side until the chicken's got those lovely stripes from the griddle which adds a gorgeous smoky flavor whilst they rest spoon over some of the remaining anchovy dressing the chicken cools down the flavour the seasoning of the anchovy the garlic and the pound zone seeps into that chicken slice the chicken into strips wow i serve the chicken warm in a separate bowl so it doesn't wilt the salad just bring the dressing finished out with a little touch of dressing an american classic i think one of the most popular salads anywhere in the world but it's still one of the most delicious [Music] when it comes to lunch this really is an american dream a delicious caesar salad and succulent golden griddle chicken with peanut butter and jam cookies for dessert [Music] your favorite chicken thighs first of all we'll turn on the grill the reason why we're using the thighs are you the brown meat is so it doesn't go dry season a nice salt pepper olive oil then turn them over please come on get your hands in there good don't worry about your nail bun so there's no bones in there so the chicken will cook really quickly why do you do it skin side down skin side down first that'll stop the chicken from going dry and it'll get it really nice and crispy good see the way it's marked the skin now yeah got all that really nice flavor in there as well and we'll turn them every two or three minutes how much do you love chicken lots lots i'm gonna serve that some really nice chickpeas first we're gonna make a little dressing okay one nice teaspoon of mustard in please a little bit of olive oil a touch of salt and pepper give that a really good mix and then just squeeze lots of lemon juice in there a little taste it's nice that is delicious now look at that chicken now follow that beautiful nice and crispy as well turn the gas down now and leave that chicken to griddle right let's get the chickpeas done shall we yep so we've got peculiar peppers so these are roasted smoked spanish peppers have a little taste i would like you to chop up the kettleberries you take off the the top i'm gonna slice them in half like that wash your fingers oh well okay so

TikTok:...",2022-11-28 22:16:02.926159, street food gets its name because it's cooked and eaten on the streets from the hawker markets in asia to the new york hot dog stands there are some great chefs out there serving seriously delicious food that you can eat on the go my first recipe is a special mix of fantastic flavors from around the world beef tacos with wasabi mayo the great thing about street food is anything goes the only rule is they've got to be really fast and really tasty now these tacos mix a mexican and japanese flavours into a delicious meaty mouthful first off get that pan really nice and hot these are sirloin steaks sear it in the pan with all that fat on i'll add flavor salt and pepper couple tablespoons of olive oil in pan nice and hot hold up the steak and lay it in always lay away give the pan a little shake and it stops the steak from sticking we're looking for color and if it sticks it's gonna burn [Music] while the steaks are cooking i can get on with my super quick marinade now two tablespoons of misood paste that's a fermented soy bean that gives a really nice sort of rich sweetness tablespoon of sugar a couple of tablespoons rice wine that gives it a really nice vinegary kick couple of tablespoons of olive oil salt and pepper i'm looking for a nice sort of thick rich marinade marinade done it's time to turn the steaks sort the pan and to give the steaks a little base all we're doing every time is just adding more more flavor take your tongs and sort of lift the steak on its back and really melt all that fat down off of the gas take them out just take your knife see all that fat there just slice that off i don't want any of that now in to the marinade [Music] beautiful tacos are one of mexico's most popular street foods they've been made from beef pork chicken or fish and are loaded up with amazing sauces and spices now i want something sort of pickly cabbage these are um chinese cabbages slice it in half and look at it really crisp and really tasty we're gonna slice that into quarters and then just shred it and take your time you think of cabbage here and you think of sort of braised overcooked cabbage nothing worse but at a taco you want freshness a little season chili flakes they sort of discreetly give it a little bit of heat a little touch of rice wine vinegar if you haven't got that fresh lemon juice a small drop of toasted sesame seed oil give that a really good mix now i need something to sort of bring it together we take some wasabi paste very hot very spicy a sort of thumbnail size i'm gonna mix that a couple of tablespoons of mayonnaise and give that a really good mix these are basic corn tortilla the trick is to sort of color them and then shape them actually place it on the gas ring use some tongs so it's not to burn yourself you can also toast your tacos in a frying pan from there i'm just gonna place it on the rolling pin literally 30 seconds as it cools down the great thing about serving tacos is people can fill them themselves just the way they want them cabbage just squeeze out wet marinade a nice rustic little mountain mayonnaise on wait you see how soft and delicious and almost sort of melting in the mouth texture we've got on this amazing sirloin look at that really nice sear around the outside it's just nice and pink in the middle start off with my crispy shell back of the spoon with the wasabi mayonnaise inside taco and just sprinkle that delicious pickled cabbage and then just start lining my taco three or four slices touch more on my spicy layer and that is how i'd make the perfect taco [Music] spicy mexican soup it's hearty delicious robust but served with some tortillas and a wonderful salsa it's almost like a complete meal in one starting with some finely chopped red onions for my soup let's get some heat going early these are chipotle so they're smoky rich they don't come with any warning signal and these are seriously hot so be adventurous but beware a nice teaspoon of toasted cumin oregano dried now start frying off spices the heat you'll see the chilies start swelling up delicious garlic be quite generous on the oil because that helps to blow out the chili right now those onions and garlic are on fire we're gonna balance the sort of heat from the chipotle with sugar turn up the heat and really start caramelizing that sugar and the chili gives off the most amazing aroma next fry up a tablespoon of tomato puree add a can of chopped tomatoes cook kidney beans and vegetable or chicken stock to cover there's something quite exciting about big and bold flavors because in the restaurants you have to be somewhat controlled you can't go crazy so cooking these kind of dishes at home gives me that kind of release chilis particularly when they're dried continue to swell and release their heat as they're cooked so the longer you cook your dish the hot it will be but it's not as powerful it needs to be yet and every five six seven eight minutes that's gonna get stronger hotter and more delicious bring that up to the bowl and cook that out for 15 minutes whilst i allow the chili heat to infuse i'm going to crack on with quick crunchy tortilla chips and a fabulously fresh and spicy tomato salsa known in mexico as pico de gallo start by finely dicing three ripe tomatoes one or two deceeded fresh jalapeno peppers and half a red onion then chop a good handful of fresh coriander add the juice from two limes salt and pepper and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil for the tortilla chips rub a little olive oil onto six large shop bought wheat wraps [Music] sprinkle with smoked paprika and gently massage in cut each wrap into triangles and spread them onto a baking tray bake for three to four minutes in a preheated oven 180 degrees until golden brown and leave to cool to complete my mexican lunch i need to finish my deliciously fragrant spicy soup the spice is there it is absolutely spot on now for the cooling down process the mexicans are brilliant at building layer upon layer of flavor with delicious chilies and spices but they're also experts at tempering their dishes with cooling ingredients like avocado sour cream and cheese that's why you can take that amount of chili you'll have a spoon of richness spice and all of a sudden avocados almost like a little fire blanket over those chilies to further counter the chilli heat mexicans use a rich tangy crumbly cheese but i'm sprinkling on lancashire which is a great british substitute and last but not least cooling fresh coriander one delicious spicy mexican soup serve that with your tortilla chips and your pico de gallo salsa a phenomenal blend of textures and layers and spice and creaminess big bold spicy mexican eggs this is a very classic mexican style brunch dish bold kick-ass flavors slice the chili seeds in garlic sliced nice and thinly a tablespoon of olive oil i'm a big fan of brunches and if you get it right a great brunch can see you right through to dinner now to start the sort of spicy fragrant tomato sauce get your cumin in there garlic chili roasted cumin red onions already sounds mexican once that starts getting really nice and crispy in with your tomatoes never embarrassed using good canned tomatoes i do all the time cooking at home now by reducing that you sort of come down to a delicious paste leave that to simmer next canned beans called black beans these are authentically mexican but cannellini beans or chickpeas will work just fine just rinse them a little bit of water that is beautiful turn off the gas and just let it absorb leaving the dense beans to luxuriate in the spicy tomato sauce will allow them to soften and soak up all the flavor next oil and season an ovenproof dish from my spicy egg brunch to baking now just get some of that oil around the outside take your corn tortillas slice them in half and then just stick them to the side these are a staple in mexico take one and place that in the center get your mix and place that on top of the tortilla spread that out nice and smoothly lift up those little flaps i want that crisp shell on the outside now your eggs and cheese get the base of the egg and just make a little hole in there and then crack the egg into there again use a little point put your egg in there one two three four five and one in the middle gently crack and get the egg to sit inside almost like it's a little dug out and then one for the center get a really nice rich delicious strong montgomery cheddar i wanna grate the tortilla shell as well so get generous with it on the top i'm going to season that with these little babies little chili flakes they're my little secret weapon and they're going to spice up that egg just salt a touch of pepper sit that in the oven to bake for eight to ten minutes and 180. [Music] [Applause] that smells incredible a little bit of coriander to finish it off and that for me is what brunch is all about let's go a fantastic fiery brunch to get your party started spicy mexican eggs and a crispy tortilla shell

Follow Gordon:...",2022-11-28 22:16:02.926159, tonight i'm taking the f-word on the road because it's the last week of my competition to find the f-word's best local restaurant on tonight's first semi-final santa maria del sur la san and sweet mandarin all extraordinary contenders at la san in birmingham i sample some of the most sublime curry i've had outside india that's exquisitely presented finesse but akhtar islam was cocky and argumentative has nothing to do with flavor well ultimately it's edible and it will add to it but it's not the core of it if you move it away you're not going to lose anything the only thing to match his immense ego was his talent i'm looking forward to lifting that trophy in contrast at santa maria del sur i was bowled over by the warmth and charm of manager jose from argentina and the passion of head chef ernesto and i've tasted some of the best egg i've ever eaten yeah amazing i mean really good and sweet mandarin in manchester served at some stunning authentic chinese cuisine it's a fabulous family business run by twin sisters [Music] [Laughter] i've got to pick the very best restaurant how by setting them all three very tough challenges for the first test i've hired a team of food experts to work undercover for me as secret diners good evening have a reservation under the name of duncan it's a trick of the western trade i use all the time i spend a fortune on secret diners coming to all my restaurants it's a really good way to see how consistent a restaurant is on a daily basis can i have the slow cooked lamb i'm sending my secret diners to all three restaurants who have no idea they've been filmed i have to find out how the restaurants perform when they're not in the spotlight and their guard is down whichever restaurant fails to impress me on this test will be eliminated first up lasan this stylish urban restaurant prides itself on cutting edge and contemporary cuisine for birmingham we were the first restaurant to break away from the mainstream when i visited la san i thought the food was fantastic but the service was slow i hope my secret dino is taken care of today by the staff oh thank you i've asked kate blindman to go undercover today because she's an experienced food editor [Music] so he sits down the gentleman and lets the lady sit down on her own there's not that many there's so many waiters around so it's quite hard to grab somebody or if they are they're collecting plates i've told kate to act like a very fussy diner with delicate taste buds is it possible to change it because it's a bit too hot for me sorry could do with a little bit more of a smile on there not look so miserable oh thank you finally smile should be at the beginning not at the end very sweet of him actually he said if i don't like this one he'll replace it again so that's really good the only thing i could be worried about with last hand service that was attentive halfway through not at the very beginning it's a little bit fragmented and service needs to gel next up sweet mandarin in manchester's northern quarter the express lunch looks like it's really good value it's run by twins who are the third generation of women in a chinese cooking dynasty established by their grandmother [Music] the sisters don't have a clue that they're going to be assessed by my undercover observer [Music] i've hired cheryl farmer because she's got nearly 20 years experience in the food industry and i've instructed her to order off the menu to see if the chef is willing to be flexible do you do a squid that hasn't got a batter [Music] without the batter is that possible okay lovely thank that lady she's you one of the owners essentially because she needed to please and uh everything's possible yeah food sort of heaped and dumped on a plate no finesse it's nice but it's just not hot enough i like it i like my food really piping hot i'm trying to get retention but the waitress has wandered up to her out of high shots in fact the restaurant's been abandoned by our staff i think the one positive part is that it's run by two sisters and they're great girls they're warm they're funny and they're charismatic but there was must've been an off day when a restaurant's family run then it needs to feel family run they need to be a lot more friendlier so will santa maria del sur do any better open five years ago santa maria is vibrant and lively the restaurant radiates warmth and friendliness [Music] my secret diner is on the way and the fun-loving brigade from battersea have no idea [Music] i've only got an hour to eat is that okay is that going to be okay rob allison regularly works on best-selling recipe books it's a bit light in here really yeah but lighter than i actually um [Music] i'd say that the filling could do with a bit of seasoning but um pastry is spot on there absolutely spot on literally we're just halfway through our starters and they've just started lighting the candles and i think they're like yeah is at the lights going down yeah the light's going down a little bit if you're open at 6 30 then you have you ready at 6 15. so the minute that first custom wall store everything's there candles are there and uses the atmosphere smell of the grills there i think for my main course i'll have i'm going to go vegetarian i'm afraid i'm going to go with the mushrooms i've asked rob to be deliberately indecisive to see how the team cope you know what yes i'm gonna be really annoying i've just seen my friends steaks i really want a steak thank you very much they have dealt with that impeccably i would have actually probably kicked my own head in had i done that slightly slow start picked up in the middle and then when he changed his mind about the dish they really warmed him in a big way so yeah great comeback so it's time to eliminate one of the restaurants my decision is based on everything i've seen and learned so far including hours of invaluable undercover evidence [Music] no one has any idea i've been spying on them but i have told them that one restaurant is about to be knocked out of the competition when you're on a roller coaster just it's just reached the top and it's just stops for a second doesn't it and it's that feeling and it's been going on for about a week now so i i do want the ride to carry on we haven't slept for the last few days just being very nervous waiting for today it's important result for my life for my for my restaurant and for cindy as well for everyone you know [Music] santa jose gordon how are you oh very nervous man very nervous waiting for you for the answer now the secret of any good local restaurant is attentive service good food recently okay we've had the f word secret diners in the santa maria restaurant on the feedback and the insight to what the f-word secret diners gave me in terms of their experience yes santa maria oh my god congratulations really well done [Applause] [Music] it's great something amazing for me my boss cynthia i'm a little one every every everyone is happy today i think it's one of the most important moments of my life santa maria have done amazingly well and now they have a chance to win a place in the final oh my god welcome back it's the semi-final of my best local restaurant competition and three teams are fighting for a place in the final only one will go through so far tonight's first semi-final my best local indian chinese and argentinian restaurants have been put to the test good evening have a reservation i sent in a team of secret diners to investigate the contenders there's so many ways around so it's quite hard to grab somebody and santa maria passed with flying colours they're still in the running congratulations but now i have to eliminate one of the remaining two restaurants who will be going out of the competition la san or suite mandarin every call i think everyone's just gonna be looking at the phone today is very important for us it really is the make or break good afternoon lasagna speaking i might help you hello swandran we've had secret diners in the dining room i've had the f word secret diners um eating a sweet mandarin recently i've learned a hell of a lot and i've seen some fascinating things the feedback's been extraordinary um the value of the set lunch menu um is amazing whilst i like your confidence there's a cockiness that has to be contained so the name of the game is consistency and that has to be so apparent across the board [Music] sweet mandarin i'm really sorry the f-word secret diners were somewhat let down the food wasn't up to scratch there was also complaints in terms of service being uninterested so i'm really sorry thank you ladies of course we're disappointed because we've gone so far into the competition you're in a losing life don't you we're a winner because we have won the best chinese restaurant did i mean really good fantastic work great feedback from the secret diners incredibly happy very consistent congratulations [Applause] well done [Applause] that's a lot of words because never experienced anything like this it's just absolutely amazing i mean the feeling is is is definitely there and i mean obviously with reference to my cocky natures you know it's just the way it is so i've chosen santa maria from south london to fight out with lasan from birmingham to be worthy of a place in the final they have to survive two more challenges [Music] [Applause] first i've asked 30 f-word diners to tesla san and santa maria to breaking point and i'm gonna judge both restaurants performance more critically than ever before we're going to have lunch at la san and then dinner at santa maria ladies and gentlemen good morning really good to see you you're going to be my eyes and ears across the whole dining room your experience is going to help me judge which restaurants go through to the final of the f words best local restaurant with lassan under intense pressure i'm going to watch like a hawk front of house and behind the scenes in the kitchen i'm expecting to wow everyone you know dazzle and delight i'm you know confident we'll uh do well because it's our own kitchen and something that we you know we're working every day and food that we do all the time so you know nothing's alien to us so i think we'll be good [Applause] hi guys hi ladies how are you all i'm very little chef how are you yeah veronique thank you good to see you right this is it real pressure you performed brilliantly in the f-word restaurant now i want to see what you like in your own ration under immense pressure two hours two courses 30 diners yes it's not just the food the service have you got what it takes to get into the final yeah this today okay will help me judge you guys under pressure i'll be upstairs downstairs in and out in and out good luck thank you two hours starting from now off you go guys yes [Applause] [Music] i know this is every restaurant's worst nightmare thirty diners arriving all at once but i need to test the team to the limit if actor harmony staff support each other today it should run like clockwork but i can tell straight away that the auditing system is far too complicated so each waiter takes an order then puts in the computer just forwards you back to touch you will enter the order so that's very difficult that isn't it because if he's entering the computer and they're taking the order if he makes a mistake then it's already going to two different people before he gets to the kitchen the orders taken by the waiters are given to the maitre d who puts them into the computer in the dining room upstairs then they're supposed to be printed out in the kitchen which is downstairs okay gentlemen here it goes you've got one lemon sole one afghani lamb get the lamb in straight away please let me still hold that back for a second we've got two courses missing on table 11's order complicated ordinance system they take the order then it goes into another waiter's hand yep then it goes to the computer you just said there's two courses missing why doesn't one waiter take an order come to the computer complete it without passing on to somebody else the reason why i'm in the i'm with the ordering system the we've got quite an old sister just to make your life easier so i'm just asking from a chef's point of view if i don't feel comfortable i come down and ask you and i want to know your reason that's all that's cool with 30 customers to look after at the same time akhtar's ordering system can't cope and my diners are now eating different courses it looks bad for customers eating their main course when other cousins haven't had their starter for me it's like a regular card operation it was not all a la carte so don't [ __ ] me that way what i'm trying to say is that if i'm sat here and i'm waiting for my starter and i'm still waiting for my starter and then the next table's main course has come i'm going to feel a little bit pissed off that's what i'm trying to tell you okay don't waffle me yes thank you and the waiting times are just far too long how long have you waited for your main courses you only shared a starter yeah how long are we waiting for the main courses roughly yeah yeah i've got it down at 35 minutes 35 minutes is far too long okay thank you uh how long for that main course please i think the customer needs to know how much longer can you give me a time 16 yeah that's towards the end you want that first give me a time for someone that's gonna be eight ten minutes at least ten minutes at least actor he's gotta get a grip get hold of the reins and really sort of start pushing this food out but you know kitchens just don't run normally they need generating you've got to push them all the time so there's a customer sat upstairs minus the main course which is not good when actors food does make it to my diners they think it's absolutely delicious really really really good very complex a lot of really powerful flavors going on so it's good but the curry isn't everyone's taste did the customer say anything when we clear this away because those are painting the sauce a bit too much sometimes okay is anyone telling the chef i think the chef says that as a signature so he kills uh he needs to have quite a lot of sausages i know it's a signature dish it doesn't stop him from making it less spicy does it it doesn't know it's like everyone's scared to tell the chef what's happening does anyone give constructive feedback to the chef downstairs or not no if this was my restaurant okay i'd be deeply concerned that food like that is coming back why is that not eaten and why is all this sauce still there is there an issue customers not happy surely you'd want to know yes that's all this is a signature dish this is something that means a lot to the restaurant yet no one's saying anything if the waiters can't give actor honest feedback on his dishes that's a serious problem actuaries gordon so chef having a quick taste of the mcmahony sauce that they're saying they're saying is a little bit too spicy okay that there's only two tables that's all just a touch of yoga but there's another table that have been cleared and two-thirds of the dish hasn't been eaten so two plus two is four there's only 30 of my diners here it's not as if there's 120 people sat up here the food in the restaurant was excellent so on that basis i think i'd you know definitely come back and give it another try so my 30 diners definitely enjoyed their lunch but there is room for improvement right uh well done i tasted every dish i thought the food was outstanding how'd you find the mutty chef i thought the food was outstanding absolutely delicious doesn't need go finish sorry sorry however when customers don't finish two-thirds of their plate i think you should see what's going on i don't think food should be washed down to the bin and plates stuck in the dishwasher i think that should come back down to the kitchen because that gives you feedback we started off good in the kitchen but upstairs was somewhat at many stages embarrassing the service was erratic order's been taken main course had been missed off i'm looking for a restaurant to win the f words best local ration on an overall experience i thought the food was delicious i thought the service was mediocre um right now you know um i see a bit disappointed that you know we didn't uh you know delight chef ramsay on all all points of dining experience could have been better but you know the fact is you know we've made it so far and he did say he's got something up his sleeve for the next challenge so i'm looking forward to that now next stop dinner at the argentine grill house in south london when i first visited santa maria they served me some of the best steak i've ever had so i hope even under pressure from my 30 f-word diners round two here we go they're going to maintain their excellent standards and and yes right navy tonight silence are coming really soon i'm always trying to relax him because he's nervous hola how are you you're right it's fine thank you this is gonna be a big test on tonight 30 diners arriving all at the same time will they manage on the grill will they manage the service will it be fast slow i want to see what they're like with me watching them in their own environment good to see you guys yeah and first of all congratulations uh really well done now is where it really is gonna be immense pressure now real dinos in your restaurant yeah that really know their food so i wanna see it running under immense pressure like a normal fully booked restaurant yeah make sure that everything you send out the kitchen you're 100 happy with because they are critical okay two hours start from now good luck off we go i remember it's not a racer not a friendship quality who's cooking in the kitchen now just two of you yesterday yes wow yeah come on go on okay we have the first table stable number three one more massage one freelancer one two one miss andrea and two united states santa maria are quick off the mark but their starters are all going out at once they need to stagger the orders and pace themselves you normally send the starters that quickly you don't waste your steaks are on first before you understand or you just send the salad straight away guess what's up okay because they're quite thick those fillets yes quite thick they've only been here in literally 50 minutes first order taken within five minutes already the food coming out good start very good start my big worry if ernesto gets 30 different steaks on that grill going away all the same time different temperatures rare medium medium well that's gonna be a big test for him in about 45 minutes time i hope he doesn't crack so far my diners are having a lovely time just from sort of the first moment we've walked in really really friendly staff the waiters came over introduced themselves they've chatted to us they've you know had a bit of a laugh with us but having served the starter simultaneously ernesto is now under pressure to have 30 main courses ready exactly the same time as well number one after the table number five please tune is ready on that table there yes surely the main calls you serve at the same time they're not eating that's all they're leaving it good to go cold sorry for the slightly delay guys it's coming the steak right now hopefully we will make it up with a steak the only the only thing is when you have all the people asking at the same time i know no no no no that's what i said you must be yourself don't send the starters so quickly so sadly there's not such a long gap between the main course and the start yeah that's i think you think that's a good point to speak afterwards let me speak with you guys there's an atmosphere that's high and it's electric which is great sounds brilliant but they just shouldn't rush food out there take their time pace yourself a little bit more the starter came very quickly within a few moments um following that after five ten minutes the main cause it's all very very fast as if they want to turn the tables for another first people that's really good because it melts yeah that is awesome we've all been here just over an hour and already the last orders have been cooked it's the last one yes it's the last one [Music] the team have worked so well together that they're finished with 40 minutes left on the clock it was it was really really good very enjoyable good taste it was perfect and absolutely melted in your mouth it's probably the best steak i've ever tasted actually i had philips steak as my main course which was absolutely superb i can't fault it at all okay right first of all well done i thought you handled it very well i thought the food you know looked and tasted immaculate i thought the service was very friendly and very charming yeah if there's one criticism tonight it's not a race you finish with just over 40 minutes left there's only 30 customers in there not 130 customers and every table yeah it's a value table they're here for an experience the overall package don't rush well done job well done good night thank you we tried to make a great job tonight with with love the passion try to make wonderful food tonight santa maria grill is gonna be a tough one to beat because there's a whole package there and it's it's done to perfection watching ernesto work on that grill i mean it's amazing i mean talk about multitask it's like an octopus with like 10 arms and more importantly above everything everything they touch is about passion [Music] we've had a day of extraordinary dining at two incredible restaurants but one of them will be eliminated the biggest test is still in front of them who's going through the final right now i haven't got a clue welcome back to the f-word la san and santa maria are fighting out for a place in the final tonight two semi-finalists have already faced two daunting tests under pressure in their own restaurants i'm seeing their true colours no no [ __ ] ups today lassan 29 year old actor has proved fearless in the kitchen one lemon soul one afghani lamb get the lamb straight away please let me show hold that back for a second he pushes colony boundaries and lasan's original distinctive menu reflects his passion for innovation i thought the food was outstanding but he risked over complicating the food trying too hard he has an extraordinary potential but he won't listen to advice even from me if i don't feel comfortable i come down and ask you and i want to know your reason that's all so he misses out on vital feedback at santa maria ernesto la brava is a master of his charcoal grill okay we have the first table table number three he times each state to perfection and that takes talent above everything everything they touch it's about passion when i'm worried that the menu an unnested repertoire is a bit limited he cooked sublimely within his comfort zone and i'm already impressed but to earn a place in the final he has to dazzle me [Music] now both restaurants face the ultimate challenge here at my own flagship restaurant royal hospital road in london ernesto must create and serve exquisite cuisine worthy of a place on the menu at my three michelin style restaurant they're cooking one dish the most important dish of their entire lives and with that one dish they've got one final chance to prove themselves i am very very nervous to cook in this restaurant because he's the restaurant of one of the best japan in the world cooking at chef ramsay's restaurant through michelin's time and something that i've always aspired to you know nevermind three one would do for me and i'm cooking the three michelin star kitchen today [Music] i've worked for over 10 years to build royal hospital road's reputation and tonight i'm putting it on the line i've invited some highly distinguished guests including angela hartnett one of the only female chefs in britain ever to be awarded a michelin star it's a huge challenge for these guys to be cooking in this three-star restaurant and then they've got gordon bearing down on them so they're probably having a nervous breakdown as we speak but you know hey ho we're looking forward to some food hopefully let's see if we get some but yeah i wouldn't wish it on anyone welcome to all hostel road good to see you guys um this is it on the back of today's performance one of you will be going through to the final first time in 10 years i've ever handed my restaurant over to any chef this is my baby three mission stars everything i've ever worked for in 25 years is inside this restaurant it's got to be absolutely perfect this is the climax one of you is going through to the final good luck off you go the teams are working one of the most well equipped kitchens in britain with the finest ingredients money can buy i've challenged both chefs to create one dish using the best quality english lamb which i provided it's incredibly flavoursome but a challenging meat to cook perfectly i know two gives away table six ernesto yeah two lamb kebabs yeah chef thank you cynthia you can respond as well please four covers away table one four loin of lamb hello yes sir thank you oh my god come on guys for his dish tonight akhtar has raised the bar yet again he's serving a roast smoked loin of lamb on cauliflower and potato with a caramelized onion and saffron gravy it's incredibly ambitious with 44 ingredients the most complicated dish currently on my menu here has only 19. akhtar has marinated the loin lamb overnight in traditional indian spices he smokes the meat with charcoal before searing it then bakes it for six to eight minutes akhtar blanches the cauliflower potato base and fries it with herbs and spices and then serves his dish with an onion and saffron gravy if akhtar doesn't blend the spices with perfect precision he'll ruin the entire dish to pull this off requires a level of skill near genius ultimately every uh competition has winners and losers it's just that until now i've never tasted what it feels like to be the loser done come on we've always said you know there's only one place for us and that is winning it uh we didn't say you know we'll you know we're having hold this for me please um be careful use a ladle because you're gonna burn my hands so the idea behind the dish was what we've got rajasthani style marinade um which is smoked with them cloves and then we've got a mogul style gravy that's they introduced the use of cashew nuts and caramelised onion and that's served with the potatoes and cauliflower which is cooked in a north indian punjabi style with the fresh fenugreek fenugreek and saffron for the potatoes cauliflower no the saffron's actually in the uh the gravy and the gravy yeah that's right the dish is a little bit too complicated it's adventurous again i just hope this time it doesn't come back to bite him on the ass very nice that looks lovely go please let's go [Music] it's very spicy [Music] standard anyway so it's only fitting that they're in just until [Music] in stark contrast to akhtar's dish ernesto has chosen to work with just a handful of flavours i am living the dream i'm so so happy today if we win that should be something incredible for my life it's a simple dish lamp kebab with a potato salad and mint chutney ernesto marinase's cube loin of lamb in smoked paprika cumin coriander and garlic and then he threads it onto fresh steaks of rosemary with red pepper and onion he mixes purple and baby new potatoes with a dressing of olive oil lemon juice and creme fraiche and add sliced radishes and herbs the chutney is a simple mix of ginger chili and mint ernesto griddles his kebab until it's charred on the outside this is definitely the first time a kebab has been served at royal hospital road it's something i'd expect to see on the menu at santa maria but today i'm looking for a dish worthy of a three michigan star restaurant okay talk me through the dish because it sounds a bit plain jane doesn't in terms of boring yes kebab but it's not just an average kebab it's a special kebab especially with the rosemary stick something natural what does the rosemary do inside that lamb rosemary is amazing i think rosemary lamb is the best combination favorite so you've got mint in the marinade and rosemary running through the lamb yes so you think the simplicity is this the best point yeah and the grill will be the over complicated yes over complicated we need to find things easy to make right yes put boom plate ready out next table and i think that is keep dancing you know today's about raising the bar and taking a dish to a different level to make it absolutely exceptional has he got the aspirations to go higher or is he going to just stay in that mainstream grill good that looks very simple but it looks incredibly delicious simple go please table five let's go thank you well done now four more [Music] away thank you quite strong on the garlic sauce [Music] that's lovely huh the sauce is delicious if you ask a footballer player where he would like to play they would say wembley you had someone to cook they would say gordon ramsay kitchenman this is the cathedral of cooking so i think they are very nervous but i think they will do it okay what you get from santa maria is passion through and through there's no there's no egos you know it's about them as a team not about one individual and i think more than anything this guy cooks from the heart santa maria has all connected bonded and it shows and yet these two here there's no teamwork there's no no support there you donkey i told you to put a fresh two on that was overcooked are you two okay we're fine jeff we're fine because it's not looking like the most dynamic team together we're singing off the same hymn sheet generally it's like they couldn't be any further apart that's how mistakes come in is that a bit hot for you you here is that a bit hot for me i just tasted it i thought it was delicious but you've got this [ __ ] thing that i've you know i i think you're quite a talented guy unfortunately cockiness rides over your talent he just turned around and looked at me and said is that a bit too hot for you not in that way not us okay well why am i supposed to take it you're not here to blow smoke up my ass and secondly more importantly i thought the dish was delicious thank you but before you ram it down my throat it's just nice to back off a little bit and show a little bit of humility i just thought fine i'm allowed to have been i'm not stopping you from allowing your thoughts but there's a difference between thinking and ramming down someone's throat i just thought chef that you found it quite uncomfortable what i was trying to say at that point was not was it too hard it will it will cut once the cream goes into it i guess that again i want to taste the base before you finished it so i can see it through different stages seen how clever it is to get from that the final dish let the food do the talking pipe down a little bit and put that big mouth big boy attitude into your food that will get you through the final how long for the last two please we'll be we're placing up now chef okay great well done good so service is over and it's time to discover the truth of my distinguished guests in terms of the curry dish today killed by lassan how was that for you i find extraordinary dish which is produced and the taste and texture saffron sauce beautifully blend super dish well presented well garnish and i loved it with this dish i think actor's done it it is in the final four definitely in my view talking about the lam kebab how was that particularly the sauce yes in terms of the lamb kebab and the uh lamko which one do you prefer the lamb kebab we happy with that very happy yeah yeah good timing was great food tasted great what was more impressive than anything is how the team works sean well done thank you thank you i am 100 happy in this great place this amazing restaurant he's a dream i am very very happy everything was amazing very very good how was that for you um it wasn't um i wouldn't say it was the best service of my life are we happy the dish um yes uh it's totally happy what's going on with the teamwork what happened there the team works out i mean the way we communicate because obviously there's the issue with the language barrier so and so forth so it's it's quite simply just blunt instructions can you follow this follow that i want you to do so well i know that chef i know you've put so much into this and you know throughout the whole process you've been so supportive and you know everything you've said i have taken on board right well done [Music] some people may look at me and think i'm cocky i'm arrogant i'm unapproachable i mean chef's obviously got the impression of me but i'm not like that at all it's just throughout the years we've always we've always been knocked for our approach by people within our industry for you know pushing the barrier not being you know go with the flow of what's available what's out there and taking the easier approach and i guess it's a defense mechanism that we've built up i'm not here to offend anyone i didn't want to offend chef but this doesn't mean a lot to me the fact that i was able to cook in the kitchen today have my my rest my menu item on on chef's menu card you know that's that has overwhelmed me and you know i'm not a man i'm not a very emotional person but yeah it's it's been very tough for me today and i didn't want it to end up this way only one russian can go through to my grand final and tonight who stays and who goes is my decision right now i'm facing an impossible task honestly who's got the edge [Music] i don't know right now [Music] welcome back to royal hospital road i'm about to choose one restaurant to go through to the grand final of my competition will it be santa maria del sir or la san in very different ways they are both exceptional restaurants before i make my choice i'm going to taste the dishes cooked here tonight by ernesto and aktar right santa maria lamb kebab doesn't sound the most glamorous but it looks fantastic a nice potato salad purple potatoes and waxy new potatoes so with the mint chutney wow the mint chunk is made with rice wine vinegar jalapeno pepper really nice and vibrant and sort of wakes up that lamb i was a little bit worried when i first saw the dish in terms of the simplicity factor but delicious in terms of taste lovely warm potato salad stunning kebab and the most amazing mint chutney yeah brilliant that was it close your eyes and wow this is heaven absolutely delicious lesson presentation quite fiddly yeah you'd expect that from rectang wow absolutely phenomenal anyone can cook lamb like that but not anyone can make a gravy as delicious as that you taste it and it blows your mind away i mean it's just phenomenal i mean absolutely delicious talented talented cook without a shadow of doubt unfortunately the biggest problem is himself and i'm faced with a tough tough choice la san they they they hit the heights but boy do they come down crashing big time but the food up there is extraordinary when it gets there santa maria consistently good every day haven't put a foot out of place yet this is a very tough call so it's the moment of truth two outstanding restaurants but only one can win a place in the grand final okay first of all to all of you yeah seriously well done i really mean that really well done absolutely phenomenal okay santa maria i love the passion absolutely love it and it's a breath of fresh air to see not just the chefs but the service at such an exciting level everything you touch is about passion and it shows across the board those 20 main courses were phenomenal the mint sauce was exceptional the texture of the lamb yeah absolutely delicious you weren't even working on charcoal and you still managed to put that flavor in it really well done weaknesses got slightly nervous when i saw just three things on the plate could you put something else on there in terms of a grilled vegetable or a salad could you push the boundary out even further i gave you the perfect opportunity today to really show off i thought the dish was outstanding thank you you delivered could you have done any more who knows lasagne the first minute i walked into that restaurant i was excited and blown away by the level of ambition you're pushing the boundaries out like no other restaurants within your category unique flavor i mean very unique flavor and you don't really expect to find that little bit of magic there that's like wow give me more of that lowe's when you get excited about reaching the top it can't be done individually it has to be done with a team that's not one in the kitchen one in the dining room that is everybody you have to take everybody to where you want to go now there's only one restaurant that's going through to the final [Music] this has been the toughest decision so far let me tell you that and i really mean that the restaurant that's going through the final [Music] is lasanne [Music] now let the food do the talking okay that this was unique really well done thank you okay and i can't wait to see how you perform in the final i won't disappoint jeff you and your team yeah yeah well done really well done congratulations and you come here you ah well done absolutely brilliant thank you that was a difficult decision for me and you are one talented chef never forget that it is a bit of a shock still is a bit of a shock and i mean i'm still still sinking in so on to the final and and and beyond yeah just looking forward to getting back and uh celebrating with the team i know you see him this emotion both restaurants produce food worthy of raw hostel road tonight i'm very proud of them but ultimately i saw real flashes of genius in the dishes akhtar created lassen has a potential to be one of the great indian restaurants and actor thorough deserves his place in the final i think everyone will tell you up in i've been quite horrible to be around because this means a hell of a lot and a dream come true doesn't sum up what this means to me

did let me tell you so we had really tasty hearty food great cakes amazing puddings all made with the freshest ingredients that's right isn't it yes let's get this show on their old town we're cooking

and simmer until thickened that's the taste of my childhood inner jug right there and it will keep in the fridge for a week [Music] now for the main course my all-time favorite shepherd's pie what's the secret behind a really good shepherd's pie i would think the vegetables you use and growing in it so we're going to use leeks and onions and then start browning off the mints you know no color no flavor i've never forgotten that you know that yeah so good half color gotta have color otherwise it puts that grey tinge on the shepherd's pie that looks sick greasy and cheap and nasty they don't want that do we and i know you don't do cheap and nasty let me clear your peelings now all right thank you very much there's no nails in there now is there no don't be chicken i remember your amazing shepherd's pie and that lovely little restaurant used to work in sheep street in stratford so you never got food sent back no sometimes they complained that there was no come on no i'm telling you you

gonna make it nice and rich okay reduce the red wine down yeah and then start covering your mince with your stock now i'm gonna bring it up to the bowl okay and then get some fresh rosemary okay like little taste yes please is it hot it's a little bit hot be careful well i don't like the way i'm sorry oh god as it cooks out the wine and the alcohol will disappear it will be delicious trust me now god spring onions will chop up and that's going to go through the mashed potatoes it's going to sit on top of that nicer i like that savory yeah delicious mince that's laced with all that red wine nice so sprinkles into there please mum and i'm going to drain off the potatoes hi there hello hello oh hi jack hi hi hello hello josh have a nice day school yeah so i'm gonna dry out those potatoes and then mash them no oh can i mash them would you okay um holly slice a little knob of butter in there for jack please so what was the restaurant you worked out there were you a chef cook i love the diplomacy were you a chef i was a cook exactly that no really you used to help me with these little right you kids do no potatoes these are nice and fluffy aren't they aren't they and you want them little delicious mashed potatoes yeah with no lumps in there hey what are you getting at huh it's great having you back in the kitchen mommy now yeah seriously brings back good memories no just why'd you do that dad i just want to fork it to get it nice and spiky so i want that nice crispy topping and then lightly grate that cheddar cheese on top and that goes in the oven literally 20 minutes 180 minutes jack can you up the door people that looks lovely doesn't it even though you said you didn't like it earlier okay back in the day mama's meals all came with two veg and this is no different but with a modern twist braised peas and carrots with a fantastic homemade mint butter shepherd's pie glazed on top that looks lovely doesn't it doesn't it and then the carrots oh seeded coats that's why i didn't put carrots in let's put them on the side i'll see last job before serving pour that gorgeous butterscotch sauce over the pudding okay i'll take one at a time that smells incredible this is my ultimate childhood dinner shepherd's pie with crispy cheese champ topping sweet buttery peas and carrots and a steam date pudding dripping in butterscotch sauce eating mess bomb right eat a mess what's the one thing you love about easter mess i love the meringues now this is a eaten mess with a twist what's the twist in it compared to the normal one we're going to freeze it so it's almost like a sort of eaten mess bomb wow now i'd like you to whisk the cream please half the strawberries are going to go through the mix and half the strawberries are going to be turned into a coulis strawberries in first a little dusting of icing sugar into the pan and now the icing sugar will withdraw the sweetness from the strawberries and start caramelizing so let me show you a nice quick way of whisking secret whisking is like 10 seconds on and 10 seconds off that way your arms don't get tired now i'm going to take the cream to a three-quarter stage what is a three-quarter mix so we leave some sort of texture in the cream that's what we call three-quarter whip and you've got a nice soft peak they're caramelized there you go you put a little touch of water in there that'll help break down the sugar and turn that into a really nice strawberry liquid now to get it really nice and fine i'm gonna blend it on and blitz off okay that's fine i want you to use the back of the spoon and push that through the sieve okay now that way you don't get those seeds smells so good i love this now nice this is the exciting part hold on oh meg right now the meringue with your fingers just crush and flake the meringue into the cream how big should i crush it dado there nice big chunks okay lovely oh okay yeah come on rang in my eye damn to make this dessert even easier i often cheat by using good quality shot port meringues you know taste that's just cream and bread wow it's a little tasty okay strawberries in next a couple of spoons of the cooling now look at that now to prepare the mold to transform the traditional eaten mess into a frozen bomb form a triple layer of climb film adding water to the bowl will help the climb film stick as i pour that in i want you to spread it down okay at the bottom and push it down can you hear that crunch yeah the line all right now fold the cling film over put that in the freezer please make young please in the freezer she goes [Music] dessert done now for our main course with a twist that is the rib eye we've had that in the fridge not wrapped so it sort of almost air dries and it intensifies the flavor gross so much quicker and there's less water in the beef for me the only downside to perfect roast dinner is the fight about who washes up afterwards so meg and i are going to avoid that by cooking everything in one roasting tin starting with the spinach and mushroom stuffing [Music] let's do it with a salt and pepper please good girl some of your left shoulder left shoulder thank you in with the garlic and the mushrooms to toss the pan you push down and pull back down and push back off you go take your time push it down and flip very good that's it push down nice that was lovely and again nice i'm gonna drop let's see well done well done well then right we're gonna sort of make a little well a little touch of butter in the middle now i need to start putting the spinach in the middle piece so you can push that down spinach is cold so you're not going to burn yourself be confident in the pan toss it and you'll see it wilting and disintegrating away wow who would have thought all that spinach could fit in this pan because it's a very delicate leaf it sort of cooks so quickly put this all on your board now and then i just want you to go and give that a nice chop then when you're confident with one hand we need to pick up the other knife the other hand chop it nicely good now outside and come in gently good regroup and take your time yes mmm right i love that smell what is that lemon thyme lemon tan that's right so you get your little thyme stalks and you pour down you sort of strip lemon thyme in now tarragon it'll taste brilliant with the beef fantastic with chicken and fish roughly chop the target and i sprinkling fresh breadcrumbs so the breadcrumbs almost sort of bring the stuffing together next we're gonna get an egg yolk now with the beef this is the exciting part slice with the bone and then come inside and go two thirds of the way down hold that open for daddy salt and pepper and then look we pack our stuffing in there this is amazing it's incredible now just gently hold out there like that okay yeah i'll see you tomorrow what tying string around the rib will keep it all together during roasting not too tight if we tie it too tightly what happens the stuffing will come out that's right that's ready for roasting but we're going to protect it and sit it on a trivet so a trivet basically is almost like a sort of little little bed a little bed that's right if you want to enjoy these delicious roast vegetables at their best make sure you remove them from the hot oven after 35 minutes and reheat before serving with your beef now a little mix for the top a couple of teaspoons of mustard powder in salt a couple of tablespoons of olive oil mix that in i'm gonna pour my mustard powder over the beef so this forms a really nice glaze my one pot roast dinner goes into a hot oven 15 minutes at 230 degrees then down to 170 degrees for another two hours for a delicious twist on traditional yorkshire puds i'm going to lace mine with fresh horseradish with plain white flour in a bowl and crack in the eggs adding only half of your milk at this stage makes it much easier to whisk all the lumps out and if like me you like your puddings a little lighter and crispier add a dribble of cold water and add salt to season when you're happy your batter is lump free whisk in the remaining milk peel and grate horseradish and add a handful to the mix we can leave the batter to rest while we get the meat from the oven that is beautiful and this is where you really need to let it rest how long would you say to rest it for um i like to rest the meat for at least 20 minutes just the right amount of time for us to whack up the oven and to get our yorkshire puddings in i love using the rich dripping but vegetable all is a healthier option to get the fluffiest yorkshires your tray and fat must be piping hot for best results take your jug of batter to the oven and pour the mixture in there it takes just 15 minutes for our yorkshire puds to puff themselves up and turn a delicious golden brown with the yorkshire puddings on the way and the beef rested we can finish off the eater mess bomb run the bowl under the hot water twist and pull nice wow look at that beauty it's amazing sit that on to your plate now the finishing touches a drizzle of the remaining strawberry coulis i'm just gonna pour this over an amazing flavor and some grated mint chocolate and that is a nice twist on a classic eaten mess a delicious eaten mess bomb beautiful let's go baby please don't drop that meg please it's not a rounders match dessert sorted and the beef is ready to serve up lift that up place that onto the board parsnips parrots you can see why we kept them in half they've got all that flavor one beautiful big slice for daddy one for maggie and then on the side it's stuffing the stuffing a bit that's the best to die for now fantastic yorkshire they're amazing aren't they beautiful mm-hmm that's been my darling and that one that's for me beautiful roast beef with a twist wow [Music] these are my ultimate classics with a twist juicy river beef with horseradish spiked yorkshire puds and scrummy eaten mess bomb topped with strawberry coulee and mint chocolate what are your favorites a marshmallow and peanut fridge cake perfect for a picnic first things first you have to slowly melt the chocolate that's bad that's good i'm gonna break up the chocolate right in there next butter goes in couple tablespoons of golden syrup it's so good if we melt chocolate too quickly it starts to separate and destroy the best and safest way to melt chocolate is always use a bain-marie but i'm going to keep a really close eye on mine and heat it over a super low heat this stunning little cake has your favorites in there our digestives now put your hands in there and give them like that one at a time ago and crush what's the one thing that you love about a picnic i love eating outside especially on a nice summery day not so much in the winter no that's gonna be the crunchy part of our fridge cake and it's called a fridge cake because it can sit in the fridge or you can freeze it now the peanuts in please can you use it without peanuts if you're allergic to peanuts oh you can do yeah definitely no what are these little babies cranberries cranberries from there marshmallows my favorite okay they're so bright aren't they why do you love marshmallows so much because they're so squishy all right give that a nice mix up chocolate is melting nicely okay i want you to pour that in and i'll mix it nice and gently slowly slowly slowly soon nice now touch more please good isn't it good give that a little mix with daddy please they're all melty and nice and cool and gooey now we're gonna line the tray so this is quite easy to make because um you don't have to bake it you just set it yeah i want you to start pushing it into the corners please with your fingers just laying out nice and flat ah it's all nice and marshmallow and oozy to get pulled spatula okay and look how delicious does that look really delicious i can eat it right now i couldn't because it's not set all right so when that sets okay it'll go nice and firm and then we can cut it into little bars little squares triangles triangles push push good but the important part of pushing it down is that we can slice it and the more we push the thinner we can slice okay good girl [Music] fridge cake done now i'm gonna make the most amazing anchovy dip with vegetables and bread first cut slices of baguette and bake in the oven at 180 degrees c for six minutes or until crisp meanwhile roughly chop garlic and shallots and add to a food processor along with a tin of good quality anchovies [Music] sprinkle in some pitted black olives flat leaf parsley and drizzle in the reserved anchovy oil and a little olive oil blitz to a paste and add pepper then decant into a jar ready to transport serve with a handful of fresh baby carrots peppery radishes and your crisp baguette toast anchovy dip a portable and deliciously palatable alfresco treat [Music] now a spicy chili yogurt dressing with a prawn salad first things first i'd like you to make the dressing fish sauce doesn't really smell like fishes so one and a half tablespoons of fish sauce two chilli i like this especially if you have it on the side of the pork little teaspoon of sugar oh that's it good in so four tablespoons of yogurt three four some zest in there why are you making it in a jam jar not a bowl well this is for a little picnic and it's a great way of transporting we squeeze the lime in there and then we put the lid on shake it and then i want you to shut it on tight [Music] it's a bit like a tummy see that sounds like my tummy only sometimes only sometimes thank you for that kind of gives you and the first time you have it's like a little thingy it's fresh salty citrusy but delicious now cucumber and the salad i want to get rid of all the seeds so if you just nice and gently peel the cucumber why do you feel it can you not eat the skin on it you can eat the skin but i want this salad to taste light and fresh you can use a knife for this too though can't you you can peel with a knife but a speed peeler takes off the slices nice and thinly so much quicker so much quicker that's why it's called a speed peeler looks better now looks a bit naked it does look a bit naked doesn't it now you get your spoon and see what happens a teaspoon just takes out all those seeds so whilst it sits in the dish it doesn't make the salad go all soft because that cucumber is nice and crunchy [Music] that's really good there you go so see where your knuckles are there that's what's always going to protect if you put that little finger out this little piggy boom comes off what did i tell you about daddy's knuckle that's the first place you cut off all the time there you go the next addition to our prawn salad is firm juicy baby gem lettuce look at the lettuce in half what about the butt the butts [Music] i'm keeping the butts on for now so when i slice it it stays together okay and then a little bit there we don't use okay when you prepare lettuce for picnic you never slice it too thinly okay otherwise it will it's good prawns already your tummy sauce is ready your dressing is ready take the lid off and the trick is you dress the bottom of your dish because i'm gonna put the prawns on here to protect the lettuce get your cucumber i put my cucumber on and then finally that is okay now the salad is not going to go soft why is that because it's not that it's not straight onto the dressing that's right what happens is we wrap this now and then we get to our picnic drizzle the sauce on top we mix it up we've got the dressing on the bottom and the dressing on top of the dressing on top that's right a little bit of tim film do you know the cling film trick i don't know the tinfield trick yet no thing fell over the top of the toilet what you don't understand it when you're my age oh you've been my age then well okay salad in the fridge with the dressing ready to go for a picnic this is my ultimate picnic dinner feast prawn and cucumber salad with a spicy yogurt dressing anchovy dip with crudites and the kids favorite chocolate marshmallow and peanut fridge cake

daddy's version of the kind of hot pot the other one nani's to make for me yeah once you've got the color on them and take them out to rest okay a little normal butter okay into the pan now it looks like a lot of onions right yeah as they start sweating down they caramelize so that will go down by half give that a little fry okay salt in i want you to put a nice tablespoon of brown sugar in there that gets them really nice and dark now get your thyme in pick off all the little buds that will get the onions packed with flavor that's kind of nice nice mushrooms in give them a nice little stir did you like to help them make your hot pot when she made them for you i used to always help them make the hot pot always now my mum would never have used this but a's balsamic vinegar brings out the flavor of the onions right now look at her onions look beautifully caramelized the vinegar has given that nice sort of gloss i'm going to put my sausages back in here now from there some red wine red wine end got the flavor underneath there going into the sausages now the sausage is going to release all that flavor inside as well look at the color of that does that look pretty cool and it's still not cooked yet up to the ball really important to boil it here because it won't boil in the oven 170 in the oven literally 18 to 20 minutes then she goes nice to go with my hot pot rich golden creamy potato gratin it's a true comfort food classic and i'm adding a delicious twist beetroot start by gently heating double cream [Music] then peel and thinly slice potatoes and cook beetroot next rub garlic around the edge of your dish to thoroughly season with a glorious flavor then grease with a good layer of butter arrange alternate layers of potato and beetroot seasoning in between end with a neat layer of potatoes and pour the hot cream over the top bake in a preheated oven for an hour or until the potatoes are tender [Music] potato and beetroot greton are bubbling beauty of a comfort

green ones what they called um i'm not too sure what the green one is another word for your nan grandmas no red no pink lady apple no granny smith granny smith apples that's right what we're gonna do is cook the cooking apples and the eating apples together i love the combination of the tartness from the brambley cooking apple with the sweetness of the braeburn get the pan nice and hot and sprinkle the bottom of the pan with caster sugar three or four nice slices of fresh ginger and three little cinnamon sticks i want you to remember that because we're gonna look for them okay because

up the speed [Applause] good girl [Music] please now let's see if you've got a really nice stiff peak so you lift them up now that is what i call a nice stiff peak well done not bad not bad next in a separate bowl whip double cream until stiff nice and slowly so cream whips so much quicker yeah nice we're gonna put some delicious lemon zest which will make the cream so much better then sweeten it

today is this all we're having for dinner jack come on i wouldn't do that too you know that there's more coming now because we're pickling it we want to sort of make it look a little bit more attractive so we go around with that okay on an angle so when you pick all the food does it does it preserve it it's exactly what it does but also gives it a really nice salty soury flavor yeah okay now splash of water and then with the sugar nice okay so we've got to bring that up to the bowl and sort of create almost like a little syrup yeah okay little teaspoon of peppercorns in mustard seeds in quite generous on the mustard seeds that gives a bit of sort of spice now those you must know cloves excellent cloves in now touch of salt no okay so from there white wine vinegar now in order for all that to actually pickle you need to boil it so by boiling it okay it brings all the ingredients together infuses all the spices and helps cook the celery have a little taste nice nice see i put some hairs on your chest yes it was good look boom it's working already now see nice wine vinegar right celery's ready yeah okay let's walk to the ball now turn that off now from there start placing the celery into that jar so when you pick other foods can you use that same recipe exactly that 100 once it's pickled it doesn't really go off mm-hmm okay now put them in there so can we eat this straight away when it's in here do you know what as soon as it's cooled down you can definitely eat that straight away i can't wait to dig into it at dinner are they delicious yes we'll leave that to cool down our pickles are ready and cooling now to marinate the chicken on fried chicken traditionally it's always gonna be done with the dark meat the brown meat so you got that nice sort of uh drum here and this bit that thigh cooking on the bone as well keeps it even more moist so first things first salt pepper please from there famous buttermilk buttermilk in it's brilliant for marinating the chicken if you can put this buttermilk over your chicken the night before the more it tenderizes the chicken and starts to sort of really relax the chicken and puts a really nice sort of creamy soury flavor in there so might stick that in the fridge for us please and we'll start the dolce de leche biscuits nice the argentinians call these shortbreads alfa jorge and they're the favorite sweet treat on the streets of buenos aires they're light crumbly shortbread biscuits sandwich with gloriously golden caramelly dolce de leche sauce for the shortbread beat together softened butter granulated sugar and beat until light and fluffy add one egg [Music] slice vanilla pots scrape out the seeds add to the mix and beat again [Music] sift plain flour corn flour and baking powder then fold the mixture together using floured hands roll into small balls flatten into discs and place on a baking tray [Music] chill for 10 minutes until firm to touch then simply bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until pale golden once cooled sandwich two biscuits together with a caramelly dolce de leche sauce [Music] finish with a dusting of icing sugar [Music] delicious my dessert and pickles are ready the buttermilk should have worked its magic on the chicken all that's left is to fry it now we're gonna roll the chicken out of the buttermilk into the flour so that's why it gets nice and crispy and blistery on the outside okay cool so what we've got to make sure because the flour is the last coat yeah this is nicely seasoned yeah okay so salt and pepper in there nice and this is smoked paprika so that gives it a little bit of sort of uh making it yeah yeah spice that's right a little bit of heat and this one my favorites what's that cayenne pepper that's right again slightly spicy but the heat works brilliantly well garlic powder traditionally are used a lot in the steaks onion powder garlic powder just run your fingers through that please cool i'm gonna get the pan on now two centimetres of oil this is a really good mix for fish as well mm-hmm gushon's fighting a nice spicy texture helps fish so first thing is we just shake off some of the buttermilk lay that down yes okay really important to get them covered completely okay in the flour yeah okay so i love fried chicken do you now lift that up there first one and you place it in there away from you off you go nice and gently good and lay away good if any stage you think the oil is getting too hot yeah just add a touch of cold oil in there or turn off the gas good gently fry the chicken for 25 to 30 minutes or until cooked through now very carefully turn them over please yeah cool can we have this every day jack fried chicken every day no definitely not it's a treat and it's shallow fried so once every three

butt that's away butts away now this is incredible there's the shoulder yeah and look there's the shoulder blade if you go through here there's a knuckle there that's connecting the top and that's why it's called a butt the slower you cook it the more juicy it is and it's great for big parties because you just come along and get your fork and shred it a delicious smoky mayonnaise and you're away onions into half and half again okay i'm gonna leave the roots on okay because i want this to sit underneath the port it gives it a chance to cook evenly and doesn't get dry in the bottom really

oil on top of that for me i keep the pork nice and moist lovely like some of the best party dishes the marinading the pork shoulder can be done days in advance so if i was doing this for a sunday and

#GordonRamsay #Cooking 

Pre-order your copy of Ramsay in 10 here...",2022-11-28 22:16:02.926159, [Applause] [Music] good evening now get here how are you i'm nervous that's the really nervous and exciting to be here absolutely what's the secret success behind ducan what is it simple dishes from uh my mum's cooking mm-hmm zita what's the secret behind your cooking what is it the good quality cooking yes and keep your customers cubby that's what tonight's all about if you want to make it back to the semi-finals okay you need to do bloody well tonight okay because only the top six high scores go through to the semi-finals this needs to be the best service of your lives tonight greek wrestling red cena and moroccan restaurant ducan will battle for a place in next week's semi-final here's why i chose them the ninth and final category my search with f word's best local restaurant is the rest of the world from japanese to lebanese from polish to portuguese here in britain we've got it all my team and i've been all over britain checking out your favorite restaurants if i had this for lunch every day my backside would be the size of a bus after months of searching through an extraordinary array of international cuisines we whittle down your nominations to two truly outstanding restaurants both serve food from the mediterranean and i couldn't wait to put them to the test the first is ducan in wadsworth south london duke and serves classic moroccan food and the man behind it is hospitality manager turned owner abdeslam khalil i've been asked time and time again whether i could recommend a good moroccan restaurant in in london i genuinely couldn't and i opened my own duken opened a year ago and is a hit with the locals everything i've ever chosen off the menu has been just delicious [Music] kellie left casablanca 20 years ago to study hotel management in london but as he's yearning to cook grew he started to teach himself in his spare time i am not a trained chef i am self-taught when i make dishes i don't look at a book i just think of the core ingredients and i keep on tweaking them until it reaches all those senses that are important for you to taste service f word viewers had nothing but praise for khalil's food so i decided to pay duke and a visit hello sir come this way please come through excellent good to see you tell me the success behind the restaurants well i actually do it's just passion for moroccan cuisine i just cooked because my mother cooked beautifully right i grew up in a household where having lunch was like the most important thing that happens i'm glad that you're so passionate the fact that it has to be authentic passionate guy very passionate i want a quaint little place from the outside it looks like a little cafe bar walk inside and there's a little mini oasis nice to kick off my moroccan feast khalil brings me a lamb's liver train the way my mom used to make lamb's liver oh lovely and so the liver has been sauteed that's right they've been actually cooked twice very gently thank you very indeed yeah the chopped lamb liver is delicious i mean authentic started with cumin and he cooked them twice very very quickly chop them and then quickly again so for a guy that's self-trained uh he definitely knows how to cook next up is chicken breast stuffed with figs and almonds with spiced couscous in terms of couscous do you steam that or is it yeah it's steamed a lot of people ask me how do you get your couscous right and it's really the simplest thing you can do just you don't leave it alone you need to give it a little bit of love and attention oh my god that's lovely really good chicken stuffed with figs with an apricot sauce sounds very very sweet but he's managed to get the balance absolutely spot on if we win the competition it'll mean so much to me it's like the underdog winning the race great lunch yeah really enjoyed it um it's been a tough decision i can only put two rations through to cooking the f word kitchen and duken is one of them congratulations thank you very much absolutely really good thank you and i'm very very happy absolutely delicious you kept that authenticity and that's really important for a local eatery thank you very much you actually filled my heart with joy we went through thanks a lot cheers for going through here fraschetta's not even professionally trained he's certainly been listening to his mother that's for sure i think my mother would be proud the other ration i've chosen from your nominations in the rest of the world category is in belsize park north london retsina is a traditional family-run greek restaurant since his father retired 13 years ago son minos has been managing the business cena's our family business it's been going on for around 25 years so it's our life in one way or another minos's mother zita has been cooking for over 50 years but still refuses to hang up her apron i like to be in the kitchen i join to be in the kitchen and make me really please what makes my mom a great chef she's a perfectionist you know she was brought up with greek food and she knows what greek food is all about zeta's delicious greek recipes keep redzina's customers coming back for more the food is absolutely fantastic you know you just feel like the quality of it is brilliant i've been to quite a few greek restaurants before but this one's definitely the best restaurant without a doubt f word viewers gave ritzina such glowing testimonials i decided to go there for lunch myself hello hi there how are you minos nice to meet you meet up good to see you smells amazing and where's the chef how are you i'm very well thank you nice to see you you look beautiful now what's for lunch today what have you got as a special in the oven we have the souvla kebabs rice roast potatoes okay brilliant well i'll leave it to you after zeta's lovely warm welcome i already felt at home but would the food live up to his reputation first up classic greek meze calamari octopus and a selection of dips nice and how the octopus cooked and squirted grilled really does smell amazing you can really balls up cooking octopus but that's done beautifully so far cedar's cooking was seriously good i couldn't wait to get it stuck into my main course shoulder of lamb beef stefado roast potatoes and lamb and chicken spit roast the dishes kept on coming delicious i mean really good that shoulder of lamb i mean that's the cut that a lot of chefs don't understand how to cook she does there should be a lot more chefs in london coming to spend a day with this lady here to see how to braise yeah a shoulder of lamb it will be very honor for us we're going to be over the moon to win it the problem i'm faced with is the variety of restaurants so the unfortunate news is and i'm really sorry to say this because i know you don't like taking any time out but you're through congratulations congratulations and it tasted fantastic um really congratulations authentic and delicious so now you have to take another day off okay if you couldn't spot the chef you'd want to meet the person because you can't quite believe that that level of authenticity is there so it's just the most amazing great food i'm very pleased and i will try my best to keep those 50 customers happy so from your nominations i've chosen two extraordinary restaurants [Music] while the f-word diners prefer the traditional moroccan dishes khalil creates for his beloved restaurant ducan or mamazita's home cooking at the greek restaurant retsina we're back in london at the f word restaurants we're going global in our rest of the world category to celebrate local restaurants serving as delicious food from all four corners of the earth and thanks to your nominations and months of searching we've found two exceptional restaurants greet red cena in north london and moroccan dukkhan in south london sardines are very popular in both morocco and greece so i've challenged the brigades to cook their starters with this delicious mediterranean fish guys it's not a race okay tonight is about that level of excitement consistency and make sure you're happy with everything you send at dukkhan in south london khalil's love for food stems from his moroccan childhood i've always kind of embraced food i was surrounded with food due to the mother that is very very passionate about cuisine before he started tonight khalil is making sardine fritters he mixes sliced sardines with shallots cumin lemon thyme rolls them into balls and fries them until golden he serves with bulgur wheat and tomato and a green pepper dressing so killer you've gone for modern interpretation with this round sardine dish the idea was actually to make a meatball without actually being a really immense sardine because they go dark and horrible when you do that the idea came from where it's it's the way we've always done them i mean my mom used fried them she didn't fry them in bowls necessarily she did them butterflied with some flour and some molar she was a big influence on your cooking oh very much so i mean the only influence really nazita on new year's eve are you going to put your feet up and say no more cooking i'm not quick he wants to eat yeah i'm not cooking new year's day is your night off yes so that's the only day tucked away in the suburbs of north london israel cena a restaurant that serves classic greek food in a warm friendly atmosphere i've been coming here for 20 years it's got to say something for the restaurant and the people brittsina's food is all about simplicity so tonight they're cooking grilled sardines with greek tomato sauce they glaze their sardines in olive oil and sprinkle with oregano then grill them on both sides and serve with salad and a greek tomato sauce made with chopped tomatoes garlic coriander cumin and paprika you're cooking the sardines on the grill yes on the bone and the bone so you're convinced that your sardine yes grilled plainly on the bone is going to be far tastier than ducans yes yes why you have to have the bone to give more taste okay interesting and why do you think yours without the bone is going to taste better than zetas i think zita is wrong because i've got a few bits of bones in there just to keep the flavour you've missed your boat i'm kidding i made sure the little balls in the sun are there eating sardines you can accept a few bones everywhere exactly unless you're the queen mother i feel i feel a fight coming here from zita zeta frame zina takes the food very seriously but for some greeks it's almost a religion traditional home-cooked food is sacred to greeks and there's a group of keen greek cooks who are about to put my skills to the test i've been given the ultimate challenge to create an amazing dish for a fantastic greek cookbook whether or not my recipe makes the grade will be down to this group the congregation from a greek orthodox church in north london they're so passionate about greek food that they're putting together their own cookbook for the creeks and cypress food is it is very important is the most important thing is their lives so we decided just to make a book and then sell it just to raise some money for the church as well nikki rossu andreyu has collected dozens of traditional greek recipes to ensure they're preserved for future generations of london greeks and only the best will go in her book if golden recipes is is good enough he's going to just put in the book otherwise it's not i love a challenge but in order to succeed i need to create a fantastic dish using a classic greek ingredient i've chosen one that's doubled in popularity in britain over the past 10 years halloumi cheese and i'll be making it from scratch now i'm taking a bit of risk here because we're also used to eating halloumi cheese made out of cow's milk i'm gonna push the boat out and make mine with a hundred percent sheep's milk today's cow's milk is used in mass-produced halloumi because it's cheaper but traditionally greek cypriots use sheep or goat's milk because it provides a richer flavor i want the very best so i'll be doing the same with the help of dairy farmer kylie threadgold so why is it that we're not actually sort of eating and drinking more sheep's milk a lot of people don't actually associate sheep with milk no if you think of uh famous french cheeses we've got rock for it's an unpasteurized sheep's milk cheese yeah that's not a very big teat is it no that's what i say it is a finger and thumb job really either jesus the fat content in sheep's milk will make my halloumi creamier and softer than cheese made with cow's milk i tell you what you make it looks so easy yeah there's an art to it isn't there i think she's just about empty there gordon you sell that unpasteurized we do sell added pasteurized obviously we produce it normally in a nice clean milking parlor it's so creamy it is incredibly creamy that looks fantastic you know that it does really good thick rich creamy and about to be turned into the most amazing halloumi that's harder than i thought it was gonna be thank you well done with a churn full of the freshest cheeks milk i leave essex and head to west sussex to meet one of the only halloumi cheese makers in the uk mark hardy produces halloumi using nothing but sheep's milk and i'm relying on his expertise to teach me to make the very best this is halloumi we made about three days ago i'm dying to taste it nice creakiness to it smells lovely got really good flavor as it breaks down the mouth there's more creamy beauty season all the way in which is lovely really nice and deep so that's the objective for mine to come out as good as this one it is i'm sure it will my halloumi will be made using the most traditional greek cypriot methods never made it before always been fascinated by its texture bring the milk up to 32 degrees an enzyme is added called rennet and in 30 minutes it sets the milk so it can be split into curds and whey and the curd here that's basically this sort of that's the foundation for cheese it's where the cheese will come from as the curds and whey are warmed the consistency constantly changes it's like scrambled egg now it does look less carbohydrate doesn't it the curd is then pressed into a mold and left to cool the lumi is simmered in the way for 45 minutes and is this process that stops it melting like other cheeses when you cook it so now they're floating and that's it yep still quite soft aren't they when you lift it out it should bounce back right basically which is what it's doing to preserve the cheese and give the halloumi it's salty flavor it's dropped into brine for 24 hours then it'll be dressed with mint to enhance its flavor now i've got to think of something really exciting to do it justice yeah i have a recipe in mind that will complement the slightly salty flavor of my handmade halloumi but would it be good enough for nikki's all-greek cookbook hi how are you i'm okay good about you very wondering thank you very happy to be here now that looks amazing oh that's good yes okay thank you nikki has sent me the challenge of coming up with a recipe that can sit alongside these truly authentic greek dishes right i've got work cut out big time and all i've got is this amazing halloumi handmade so i'm gonna do salad and pan fried scallops with some wonderful sauteed 100 sheep's milk halloumi slice the scallops and coat them in flour egg and japanese breadcrumbs get them nice and crisp on the outside and very sort of sweet in the middle their sweet flavor will go brilliantly with a salty halloumi the good thing about halloumi made with a hundred percent sheep's milk is it doesn't crumble now discs of halloumi to sit on top of the roasted scallops hot pan the halloumi is fried alongside the scallops in olive oil nice thing about the lumi when you saute it like that it doesn't melt it doesn't disintegrate but what it does do is get a really nice flavor a little seasoning on the scallops to go with the halloumi and scallops a caper and sultana vinaigrette simply boil both in some salted water a little touch of olive oil in there and a teaspoon of white wine vinegar then blitz scallops onto the plate the golden brown halloumi is then served on the scallops with the vinaigrette that looks amazing i hope i've done justice to my halloumi and more importantly it passes the test for their authentic greek cookbook all right please take a little slice okay you like that it's delicious really no first and foremost important how was the halloumi first very good halloween it's like the halloumi that you are making at home and it's very very nice really and the combination with that and the discoloration is brilliant really it's very good the most important question is it going to go in the cookbook oh yes yes excellent thank you yes please we wish you all the best thank you very much indeed very nice last table is a two okay a little wipe down four last table yes little wipe down first so don't go up and leave the plates good well done that's your last table yes yes yes clear down and get ready for the main course well done it was very tasty and the sauce was very complimentary to the fish once you actually managed to get it off of the bone nice to see you both are you well yeah very well it's good to see you again good to see you too what would it mean for you tonight to walk out here as a winner oh it'll be absolutely fantastic especially for my mother all the years that she's worked in the kitchens and one more another it would be fantastic extraordinary woman that is so passionate hasn't taken the whole day in two years where is he going to retire i've been doing that for years the reason i bought this big restaurant overall so to calm down a bit relax a bit well you could do a deal with her promise her to shave properly and then she could retire no maybe maybe maybe yes i would have gone in yes you should have saved it for it um good to see you guys thank you take care bye-bye it didn't have much taste and to be honest when you see a sardine you expect it to be like a sardine nice and fresh and grilled not messed around like that isabella nice to see you nice to see you hi wise welcome to the f word how are you very excited yeah watching it in action how does it make you feel well he's not normally like that he's a bit stressed today but uh i'm sure he's enjoying himself yeah do you think he's gonna win tonight well i really hope so because he's he's so passionate and he really cooks with his heart so yeah nice to see you hope you enjoyed my courses thank you thank you right redzina's simply grilled sardine hopefully they'll just flake off the bone nicely yeah beautiful touch of the sauce flavor delicious seasoned beautifully and it just falls away from the bone delicious really good now do can it looks like a plate of meatballs on couscous he's left the skin on which is a bit disturbing does it deliver in flavor quite mushy and floury inside and it doesn't actually taste much of a sardine it's a clear winner for me definitely it's seen as char grilled sardine simply done tasting delicious no fuss if the donors don't like their starters they don't pay the results are in thank you so duke let's start off with you first yes the number of customers that are happy to pay for their starter out of 25 is [Music] congratulations 21 out of 25 great start what are they like debbie um great

clear down yeah let's concentrate on the main course now both thresholds are going to cook their main course first up ducan duken's signature dish tonight is king prawn and muscle tagine i'll take a couple of peppers from there khalil starts by making sharmulla paste with chopped coriander sliced garlic salt cumin paprika and lemon juice he adds finely chopped preserved lemons and mixes with olive oil to make a paste he puts the shamula into a sizzling pan two generous teaspoons there and adds king prawns and harissa it's beautiful smell really really beautiful the adds chopped roasted red peppers mussels and covers really mostly what i'm trying to get there is the flavor and the color for the dish then add sliced potatoes and simmers he serves in a tagine pot and garnishes with grilled lemon and coriander king prawn and mussel tagine served what's so special about this tagine it's made with charmoula a very well known moroccan marinade and how successful is this tajin with the prawns and mussels been in the restaurant this is very successful actually i mean i've got people coming particularly just for this dish yeah so cetera where did you learn to cook i learned from a very young age i like to be in the kitchen with my mother at greek restaurant rosina head chef zita's menu is inspired by recipes she learned from her mother retzina's signature dish tonight is a greek mixed grill for the chicken kebabs is either cubes a chicken breast she then coats the chicken with a marinade of oregano greek yogurt pepper puree crushed garlic lemon juice and olive oil i make a taste and moist not to get dry because always the breast the chicken if you're not very careful it's very dry for the lamb kebabs zita marinades cubes of lamb in pepper puree lemon juice and oregano next she chops onion and tomato for the kebabs then grails and base with olive oil and lemon juice oregano salt and pepper then she grills the lamb cutlets and finally ceta grills the cards liver then plates everything up with fresh tasiki tabouleh some rocket leaves and a wedge of lemon fredzina's greek mixed grill served [Music] why do you think the diners will be excited about this it's very juicy very tasty very nice now your son said that if you win tonight he's going to shave yes that stupid beard off i've got a sharp knife oh my god if you win tonight it's coming off that's the game good news for his lively studio we have to do it definitely guys remember yeah every table has to go out like the first level yeah with that level of exact perfection yeah absolutely good now for some festive pie filling moroccan style traditional british mince pies have been around for centuries they used to be filled with fruit real mince meat and spices brought back from the middle east during the crusades over time the meat has given way to the fruit and spices they still do something similar in morocco but it's called pastilla but moroccans use a meat seldom seen on british menus pigeon [Music] who better to send on a taste test than my favorite old london bird janet street porter most people think of pigeons as nasty bourbon and wouldn't dream of eating them it's not surprising is it the scruffy feral pigeons we see in our cities hardly look appetizing i wouldn't even think about eating them pigeons are surrounded okay so flying rats don't exactly get you going but wood pigeon the feral pigeons clean living country cousin might in morocco they absolutely love it now i love moroccan food and i think they've got exactly the right idea when it comes to making pigeons tasty wood pigeon is on the menu of one of the finest moroccan restaurants in the uk momo in central london i'm here to meet executive chef mohammed aurad hi mohammed i'm janet wood pigeon is prized for its rich red meat but you'll probably need to order it from your local butcher okay so they're not skunking not flowing right they're not flying rats that's very good they're not blind rats that is a free-range wood pigeon it looks absolutely delicious mohammed's going to be showing me a classic moroccan dish that you can do at home pastillas with a pigeon filling tell me what it is it's a pie it's a pie with this very complicated p filo pastry exactly first the filling mohammed fries finely diced onions in butter how many of these do you make in a week you make about 30 days 30 a day next we take the breast meat off the bone and add the carcasses to the onions moroccan cuisine is all about spices scents and colors so we also add chopped coriander and sliced ginger five sticks of cinnamon in bosch for squash and a pinch of saffron now leave this to food two hours at least okay great the pigeon breasts are coated in olive oil seasoned and seared in a separate pan we remove the carcasses and cinnamon sticks and add sugar it smells delicious sugar helps to create that mouth-watering moroccan mix of sweet and savory flavors that reminds me of christmas as the filling mixture reduces we dice the pigeon breast two beaten eggs are added to thicken and bind the filling mix we add an extra sprinkle of cinnamon and the pigeon meat goes in it's an unusual combination of smells it's very very unusual the pastilla filling is now ready now final stitch brush the edge of a sheet of phyllo pastry with egg white place the pigeon meat filling in the center and top with roast almonds fold the pastry so it's a very sophisticated piece of origami wrap a second sheet around the pastilla and stick down with egg whites all right i'll have a go okay i go in yeah try to no no no no no no don't worry i'm on it i'm on it okay i think what i really like about moroccan food is combining meat with sweet things it's just fantastic look at that we glaze the pastilles with butter and stick them in a hot oven for five minutes oh it looked fantastic that's my one and that's your one finally we dust them with icing sugar and finish with cinnamon truly moorish it's delicious it is it's a combination of sugar and meat together right i'm going to take mine for gordon right it wasn't nice having you it's a good life thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music] you're great thank you now moroccan restaurant in the house tonight yes you've also been cooking a spot of moroccan cuisine today i learned how to cook a pasta amazing so this is pigeon yes dear this is something that i've eaten in morocco it's meat sugar and eggs together that's delicious in filo pastry but it's delicious really good indeed now they're not the sort of average pigeon that fly over nelson's column these are wood pigeons they're wood pigeons and they're very plump when you cook pigeon it overcooks within seconds that is moist delicious slightly gamey but sweet what you are supposed to say golden rice if you don't mind me please saying so janet what a beautiful pie you made with that filo pastry folding it round your meat no you just mashed it up beforehand it was it was like origami really well done good to see you last table for stunning grill yes make him perfect guys yeah well done thank you very good thank you thank you really well done well everybody yeah job well done thank you the meat was all cooked to perfection um i thought it went really well with the satsiki and the tabouli it was really nice actually the only thing that led it down was the prawns they were slightly overdone but the presentation was fantastic lifting off the lid was really good right i've been dying to taste these and bed scenes grill lamb nicely marked beautifully cooked and that's delicious again simply done beautifully char grilled chicken marinated with the pepper and the onions yeah i mean the whole thing looks simple but the most important thing about this is getting every little component right and they have duken uh awkward muscles in the shout prawns with the heads on and then potato in the bottom so prawns slightly rubbery it's a great shame and when they're bright white like that inside it's it's a sign of the prawn actually being so overcooked potato at the bottom that's really weird because potatoes rock hard overcooked prawn and a slightly undercooked potato what a shame i hope the diners didn't get what i got so it was up to me definitely the mixed drill the votes have been counted and the results are in right results of the main course jb please good luck to all four of you uh right uh zita so the number of customers that happy to pay for your mixed grill out of 50 is [Music] well done 37 out of 50. ah really good thank you for the like and before the the meat was delicious yes and the tizzaki was full of flavor and the third thing they didn't pay what are they saying the liver of the cooked and the veg undercooked and the veg on the skewer undercooked yeah okay right the number of customers they're happy to pay out of 50 for your tagine [Music] is [Music] 19 out of 50. what went wrong um prawns overcooked the potato undercooked that's the kick in the balls you can pull this back do not give up okay thanks jeff yeah the diners are sitting in judgment on two brigades who are determined to make it through to next week's semi-finals and if they make it all the way to the grand final they'll be cooking with meat provided by janet from her farm in yorkshire this series i've asked janet to provide the meat for the f word's best local restaurant competition final come out your bloody lazy birds get off your asses along the way she picked up a few prizes of her own both her dexter cattle and a mangalits of pigs won rosetta at the prestigious nidadell show oh my word janet well don't oh fantastic a sure sign of the quality we can expect in the f-word kitchen janet's dexter stairs and ixworth poultry have already gone for slaughter but the three porkers have clearly got under her skin and janet's face with the hardest farewell of all hi guys i've come to say goodbye i'm afraid it's off to the slaughterhouse for you i'm sorry because you've been good fun and you've got great personalities but you're gonna make the most fantastic me i know that do you want one last game of football should we just have one last game i'll be in goal come on pass pass it come on pass they will make the most brilliant me i know that and they've really fattened up well they're really happy animals so i don't feel that bad about them going to the slaughter yeah right very good janet takes the pigs on their final journey well i'm sad the pigs are going to be saluted because they of all the animals they've got the biggest personalities and they've been a real pleasure to be around on the other hand they're never going to be pets they will always be in bread for food and i think they've had a terrific life hello janet hi martin oh terrible weather beautiful weather slaughter man martin mcintyre leads the pigs to a temporary pen this brief respite allows the pigs to relax and it's called larige nice piece i don't want the last time they see me to be wearing looking like this the pigs will be slaughtered as humanely as possible so before they are killed they'll be stunned electrical tongs past 240 volts through the pig knocking it out they'll know and feel nothing the pig's throat must be cut within 15 seconds of stunning to ensure an absolutely painless end i mean it's hard to watch you sure they don't feel anything not a thing the pig now dead its carcass goes into hot water tank to get rid of its extraordinary wiry hair feel that janet like a baby's bone [Applause] an inspector from the meat hygiene service monitors the slaughter process to make sure all the meat and offal is fit for human consumption the pig is then gutted and his organs inspected so does the meat inspector inspect all of this yeah they have to be certified before they can pass into the food supply chain next she inspects the carcass i think that's really good yeah it's a good pig good pig right so we can serve that in golden's restaurant yeah you can okay well get your stamp on it then finally the carcass is split and hung in the chiller ready for shipping pork should hang for two to three days for its best flavor back at her small holding janet has time to reflect on a in a lifetime farming experience mother room well it's not something i took to i miss the pigs eggs worth chickens dexter cattle mangalits of pigs the two restaurants lucky enough to go through to next week's final are sure to have some fantastic meat to cook with [Music] for the dessert the brigades are cooking my recipe for apple cake

golden rules for producing fantastic food is learning to cook with confidence this recipe is so straightforward but tastes absolutely amazing pan on get that nice and hot you think of the sort of density of a pork chop how it needs a little bit of help sweet sound peppers go brilliantly well first slice the peppers that's the flat side of the pepper so stand it up trying to slice a pepper on the side is a nightmare there's the center start off it's almost like sort of peeling an orange go all the way around and down and look that's what you want now place the pepper down three finger rule one finger in front two behind pinky holding it down thumb holding nice and flat the flatter the vegetables the more confident you are when you slice so don't worry about the speed just let the knife do the work and take your time speed comes the most important thing is to get your technique right red onion now sweet sour peppers olive oil in [Music] i'm going to saute them which is just the chef's turn for shallow frying on a high heat for maximum taste some salt and pepper add a tablespoon of sugar sugar helps to break down the peppers quicker but caramelize the onions frying them in a frying pan perfect it's one of the sort of basic essential tools of any kitchen because it's so multi-purpose great for sauteing tossing great for cooking fresh and meat push away and pull back push away and pull back that hissing is something you need to hear constantly because the minute that's gone your peppers and your onions start to boil and you really want them to soak in you now start to see it glistening the way that it's starting to caramelize sugar's working beautifully that's ready for the red wine vinegar in smells incredible it helps to stain the peppers as well look at the glaze now you can see the sugar it's worked as magic turn down the gas and add a couple of tablespoons of fresh extra virgin olive oil let them stew for two to three minutes now i want to make the peppers nice and light and sort of sweet aromatic just roll the basil almost like a big cigar slice basil in and then literally cook it out for 30 seconds i want them off beautiful okay pan back on now for the pork chops i want to make sure they don't curl up in the pan they start curling up in the pan they're going to cook unevenly a few simple cuts through the rind means the chop stays flat and cooks evenly point the knife down flip through this seasoned beautifully nice large shards of pepper punch that through lightly guaranteed that seasoning is gonna stay there hot pan touch garlic and touch of thyme the garlic take a couple of cloves don't peel it don't chop it just knife on crush it olive oil in just starting to smoke top of the chop in and lay away from me nice keep that heat in the pan put the garlic in there early a nice fragrant bunch of thyme see how the pork is staying nice and flat turn that over look at that beautiful i want a little bit of thyme underneath there start squeezing that garlic out i want the flavor coming out butter in thin slices of butter tilt the pan and baste so i'm sort of speeding up the cooking process at the same time i'm keeping the pork chop really nice and moist and now look at the color of that butter it's almost like sort of a nut brown check the color on the other side useful when they're that thick three and a half to four minutes each side thirty seconds from now they're gonna be medium so i'm gonna take them out and let them rest the secret to perfectly moist pork chops is letting them rest almost as long as they're cooked in the pan [Music] a nice spoon of these peppers the basil smells incredible keep that garlic on there be generous with that vinaigrette from the peppers because it really is incredible do two things simple like that pork and peppers and your confidence is gonna shoot through the roof a stunning pork chop with sweet and sour peppers my next recipe turns what used to be a decidedly unfashionable cut of meat into the star of the dish fit to grace any table slow roasted pork belly with fennel [Music] slow roasting works better on fattier tougher and unfashionable cuts whether it's a cheek or even a neck or this amazing pork belly it's a fantastic way to transform cheap cuts into amazing melting perfection take a very sharp knife bring the pork belly towards you so you're over it and you've got all that pressure and weight using the tip of the knife i'm just sort of nicking it and go across the pork belly long strokes with a knife take your time turn it 180. this time what we're doing is just sort of cutting those nice little sort of diamonds but as that starts roasting on top it starts getting nice and crispy take little handfuls of salt and just sort of rub it in bend it over and in all those cracks really helps to get a nice crisp crackling on top roasting tray getting really nice and hot take a hole over fennel to intensify flavor and to keep the meat succulent i'm braising my pork belly with strong vibrant spices and vegetables crush and peel three whole cloves of garlic and add to the fennel olive oil in fennel in i like the nice strong anita flavour that goes with that nice rich dense pork fennel seeds delicious star anise in and just a couple of cardamom seeds and wow they're like little bangers like little firecrackers incredible lovely fresh bay leaves get your pork skin side down just sear the top of that fat that locks in all that amazing flavor then i'm gonna flip it over and get it nice and crispy and then one fennel seeds embedded in those little cracks now some white wine the minute that white wine hits that pan you can smell that light fragrance from the fennel allow the wine to bubble away and reduce until the alcohol has burnt off time that the stock now the stock goes in just underneath the skin so it roasts on top all that meat under there will be submerged because what happens in the oven the top goes crispy as anything and the stock reduces and brazes at the same time really importantly bring that back up to the ball before it goes in the oven otherwise it will never boil never get up to temperature smells incredible slow roast the pork belly at 180 degrees for two and a half hours [Music] look at that you've got that nice crispy skin on top you can see how much of the stock has evaporated put that onto the board it looks stunning to make a delicious rustic sauce with the flavour-packed contents of the roasting tray first get rid of the excess fat take a couple of slices of bread it's like a perfect sponge because you just lay that on top and drag it almost like a net and it just absorbs all that fat if you want the perfect fried bread trust me stick that in a frying pan a nice teaspoon of mustard whisk that in and then simply simmer for a few minutes before pouring into a serving jug with your pork belly always use a nice serrated edge knife you can hear that oh that is amazing incredibly tender that belly of pork is gonna almost melt in your mouth you've got that sweet meat under that crispy belly of pork what an amazing way to cook a very cheap cut of meat [Music] smoky pork sliders with barbecue sauce everyone loves a burger they're a true fast food original and that's the exciting thing about street food you can take an old classic like that and reinvent it into something really exciting when you think of a burger what you need is a great sauce and unlike smoky barbecue goes hand in glove with a great burger start by finely chopping one onion and three cloves of garlic nice hot pan tablespoon of olive oil onions and garlic into the pan a nice seasoning salt and pepper now the secret of a good barbecue sauce is that really important caramelization to begin with a nice tablespoon of brown sugar it darkens the onions but it really starts to sort of give that nice syrupy body to the sauce and put a little bit of heat in there now a nice teaspoon of smoked paprika that's the important part of working with spices you've got to cook them out and almost sort of burn off that rawness especially with a smoked paprika that's exactly where i want it to go onions and garlic beautifully caramelized cider vinegar in reduce that down now i've got a fantastic smoky base to complete the sauce i'm making my life really easy and adding pre-made worcester sauce and tomato ketchup cook that out for two to three minutes now depending on how thick you like the barbecue sauce that determines how long you cook it out for i don't want it to be too runny but i don't want it too thick either that's the consistency we're looking for lovely turn down the gas charger seasoning now take that out it's the kind of sauce that i like to have sort of bottled up in the fridge it's great for sandwiches but goes brilliantly well with these sliders homemade smoky barbecue sauce [Music] give the pan a little wipe now start the mix for the sliders to give my mix a really interesting flavor and texture i'm gonna be using unsmoked back bacon i travel all over the world and i spend a lot of time in the states they know how to make a great slider pork sliders beef sliders chicken sliders and it's almost like a way of having a burger but on a much smaller miniature level little teaspoon of olive oil i want that bacon to get really nice and crispy bacon in this just gives the really nice sort of chunky delicious mix i want texture and pork is perfect for a slider [Music] and choppy slot slots are a lot sweeter than your normal white onion fine fine fine and in [Music] now that bacon's getting really nice and crispy i want a bit of heat in there a little teaspoon of smoked paprika in there when you see these sliders in the states for one portion there's like four or five of them little mini one biters incredible now take your pork just open up and give that a really nice seasoning so important you can't season a slider after you've cooked it it's impossible so season it nicely bake now that's nice and crispy just take a little touch kitchen roll and just drain that off there nice pat that nice and dry i want all that nice sort of crispiness in there beautiful mix all that in take a nice ball and sort of roll it the size of a golf ball get it nice and round first and then three fingers just pat that down don't flatten them too thin otherwise they overcook and they go sort of dry because sliders are bite-sized burgers designed to go in small buns you don't want to make them too big good get the pan nice and hot a tablespoon of olive oil when a slider is literally that thick about an inch thick we're going to take two and a half to three minutes to each side in turn them over lovely once you've turned them tilt the pan and just spoon all that juice back into them keep my mouth watering now it's very easy to dry the pork out so just feeling it now with your fingers is nice and firm it's a little touch of springiness in the center i'm happy with those add your cheese now so it gets nicely melted i'm using wedgies of smoked cheddar and it has that nice sort of soury smoky creaminess to the slider finally shredded baby gem lettuce just take those buns make sure they're sliced nice and evenly take your lettuce be quite generous with the lettuce just a nice thin slice of tomato take your burgers you see that cheese you feel melted your bbq sauce place the top on and that is my version of a slider that is small dynamic but packed full of flavor i'll take that over a hamburger any day sticky pork ribs one of the secrets to great cooking is patience leaving dishes to marinade for one or two days helps to develop the flavor in your food and the end result so much more delicious it's a method i use in the restaurants all the time first off get your roasting tray put the tray on the gas pork ribs 60 meat and 35 40 fat give them a really good season salt and pepper nice thing about this cut they stay incredibly moist when they're on the bone and the longer you cook them the more delicious they become and just push all that seasoning in to the pork olive oil in make sure that tray is nice and hot and i really want that nice sort of caramelization taking place on the pork that's the nice thing about starting it on top of the stove use your roasting tray get them colored and then the oven putting the ribs straight in the oven you don't get the color it looks sort of boiled as opposed to a nice caramelized rib ginger you can't beat fresh ginger with sticky pork ribs place it down nice and firmly and slice the thinner you slice the ginger the more fragrant the ribs garlic now it's really important before you add anything to those ribs make sure you've got the color from the ribs first don't rush it turn them over that's what i want that nice crispy color as they sort of braise in the oven all that color just turns into the most amazing flavor braising is just a chef's term for cooking something slowly in liquid right ginger and garlic in spread it around on all those ribs to sort of roast the ginger and the garlic chili flakes chili flakes in next szechuan pepper citrusy vibrant peppercorns incredible in next star anise that gives it a really nice sort of anisd flavor almost like you're roasting the ribs in fennel and now we've got the heat got the spice i want to sweeten things up a little bit some fresh honey honey glazes the pork beautifully counteracts against all that spice in there but look what's happening a color on the ribs is extraordinary it's like a really nice chili sweet caramel now soy sauce brings that little bit of saltiness to it really generous with the soy sauce japanese vinegar two tablespoons of vinegar in rice wine it gives it that nice sort of um tartness the ribs if you can't find rice wine our dry sherry's a great substitute 300 ml that takes out the heat of that szechuan pepper those dry chili flakes make sure they're all laid down like a nice tight box of matches bring that up to the boil cooking is all about learning to develop your own likes and dislikes so always keep tasting to make sure you're happy with a combination of flavors it's lacking a little touch of vinegar what that sharpness now think what's going on the tartness the heat the caramel the color on the ribs is amazing i want a bit of a sort of oniony flavor put some springiness in whilst these ribs are in the oven the spring onions will sort of puree they give a sharpness the final taste of that pork in with my spring onions and with my stock 400 ml of stock this is just a simple chicken stock the stock just sits underneath the ribs it absorbs into the rib and the top of the rib glazes underneath the rib that gets crispy and rich and that's what makes the ribs nice and moist really important into the oven cook at 180 for 30 minutes turn the ribs over and cook for a further 30 minutes [Music] now wow they smell incredible each side has got that really nice crispy roasted egg becomes sticky and chewy and sweet sour the fats disappeared and the pork just melts in your mouth i want to take them to the next level gas back on now shake the tray and this is the sort of the way that we finish them in the restaurant but every minute they glaze in that tray they just get to taste better and better now look at them i'm so happy with those ribs done absolutely delicious now but if you want you can put them in the fridge and the flavor will keep developing then just reheat them when you want to so [Music] each rib has a nice slice of ginger on there [Music] wow look at that delicious sticky ribs with an amazing marinade

them hard in the kitchen gives you food in a budget that tastes a million bucks and i'm going to show you how first up my flavor packed lamb with fried bread whether i'm cooking high-end dishes or rustic dishes trust me it all has to be impressive so this lamb dish proves that you don't have to spend a fortune to create delicious food first off put the pan on this is a lamb steak and it's cut just above the leg just here because you can see that delicious bone running through the center and that's full of marrow so that just gives the lamb a nice added sweet flavor just take your knife cut through each end this stops the lamb steak from buckling so therefore it cooks evenly and colors beautifully so and pepper lamb needs quite a lot of help with the pepper so be quite generous with the pepper and just pat that down the pan is just under smoke on the outside now put the oil in get that pan really nice and hot because this is a cheap cut so i'm depending on the color of the lamb steak to really sort of impart a lot of flavor that's the noise you want to hear you can't hear that noise don't drop the steak in put a little bit of garlic in there not chopped garlic just whole cloves the garlic lightly crushed don't even waste time peeling them in tongs lift up that bit of fat around the back that's the top of the leg tilt the pan and let all that fat render rendering is a chef's term that means melting the fat it works brilliantly when you're cooking a rib eye as well cut it over that color beautiful now it looks like an expensive cut and we've got that nice even sear all over as it's cooking just tilt the pan and vase and basting the lamb steak just means you're sort of adding all that nice scented garlic olive oil back into the lamb useful now take the lamb out let the lamb rest [Music] neutral [Music] now for the perfect rustic crouton so this bread's quite firm a couple of days old just slice it straight down the center dice it up put it into a bowl season it beautifully [Music] from there i'm gonna add some milk sounds strange adding milk to crouton but it just gives it that nice rich creamy texture and just let that milk sort of absorb into the bread while that's soaking i'm gonna make the dressing go back to that initial garlic that was in the pan look at that beautiful into the pest and water anchovies anchovies go brilliantly well with lamb i want that nice salty vinegary flavor and a bit of kick some capers the little baby cats very sweet now just pound that to a nice paste that smells incredible next some dijon mustard a nice teaspoon and a half in a little bit of red wine vinegar two tablespoons and then our extra virgin olive oil now it's got that heat in there i've got a nice roasted garlic a real hearty chunky vinaigrette that sort of seeps into that lamb some fresh parsley crunch up the parsley delicious flavour parsley in nice now get your pan hot for the croutons olive oil in the pan grab the croutons and squeeze all the excess milk out not too hard i don't want them dry and in and then just fry them and the milk inside these croutons give it a nice spongy creamy delicious flavor that's the color i want nice now take them out and lightly drain them a little bit kitchen roll onto the board out [Music] it's a plateman just take this amazing vinaigrette and spread it get those croutons listen to them like little boulders hitting the play the lamb sit that on next one on the rest of the croutons on now use all those little bits and my chef in paris would kill me right now if you saw me using those because they're the ugly scraps that customers should never see but but they're the best bits croutons on and then just drop that sauce on all those little bits of the lamb and there that is a perfect way of taking a cheap cut into the premier league of dishes vegetables are such an asset in the kitchen healthy fantastically fresh and incredibly versatile and pound for pound they're so much cheaper than fish or meat just make sure you give them plenty of attitude my homemade gnocchi making your enoki is so simple to do yet the results are absolutely stunning and it's a great way of using up leftover baked potatoes you can make gnocchi just with flour and eggs however the potato gives it a nice light sort of creamy fluffy texture cut them in half take your spoon and scoop the inside of those potatoes i'm using leftover baked potatoes but this really works as well with leftover ball potatoes two choices you can get a fork and sort of mash the potato and get it nice and light and fluffy or this little gadget it's called a ricer i suppose it's a posh word for a potato masher just squeeze gently you can see how nice and light it is almost like fluffy little strands of potato you can do this when the potatoes are hot it'll go through the rice so much quicker just slice that off there now a nice spoon of okata ring a little touch of salt and pepper it's really important to season the mixture as we go along otherwise the nokia becomes really bland flour over the ricotta sieved so there's no lumps one delicious egg give that a little whisk now make a little well in the center you want a nice soft pliable ball of dough give that a really good mix get some thyme flowers in there and this time is light fragrant and it's just a really nice herb and with the ricotta it tastes brilliant just pick the little tips the time flowers next flour your hands generously and knead the mixture into a dough fold in and push and basically what it's doing is get it nice and smooth as it starts to get a little bit wet and just add a little touch of flour we want something really nice and soft now don't overwork it it stops the nokia from expanding when it hits the pan that's exactly what i want a nice sort of soft fragrant ball cut the ball in half lightly flour the hands and just roll it gently just think of a a big long cigar the mixture will start getting a little bit sort of wetter but do not add lots of flour now lightly flour the knife so when you slice the gnocchi it doesn't stick cut the dough into bite-sized pieces just take your finger dip it in the flour and push down why i want my knocking to look like a pillow and for me the most important part there is that not one of them are identically the same shape water on bring it up to the boil little touch of olive oil in there lightly flour your hand lift up the gnocchi in to the rolling boiling water turn that pan to stop them from sticking at the bottom and let them simmer and they start to sort of tell you they're cooked when they start floating get a pan on get that nice and hot now they're just starting to come up to the top and you can continue cooking them like that i like blanching them in the water take them out and then frying them to study the gnocchi heat olive oil in a frying pan gently lift up and look they've doubled in size drain it get rid of the excess water and straight in to the hot pan [Music] this is where they start to take on a completely different texture nice crisp sauteed texture on the outside nokia loves fresh pepper so pepper in you can see as i start turning them got this really nice little sort of brown color and they almost popping up now like little parcels so i want them nice and sauteed both sides but light and creamy in the center fresh garden peas in and the butter gives it a really nice sort of bernoulli flavor on the end beautiful put a little bit of fresh thyme over the peas and then finally i want to lift it up fresh lemon zest the lemon over smells incredible and then finally seal the deal with a touch of grated parmesan cheese give your vegetable attitude and you'll get amazingly elegant dishes on a budget that are always guaranteed to impress what more do you want from great cooking cheap to make easy to cook and absolutely stunning my next recipe is a proper british classic that's super simple to cook and cost next to nothing a delicious apple crumble crumbles are the perfect way to use fruit when it's in season there's lots of it about it's nice and cheap but most importantly the fruit's at its absolute best [Music] first off i'm gonna make a really nice light caramel pan on nice and low great to apples [Music] this helps to almost sort of pure the apples so much quicker there's a lot of flavor in the skin so don't worry about peeling the fruit whether it's pears plums peaches flavors in the skin nice to start the caramel a couple of tablespoons of sugar the sugar helps to get rid of the tartness in the apple a touch of cinnamon that starts to make it a little spicy open up your vanilla just scrape out all those seeds now this just makes it light and fragrant all those seeds in to the sugar when making caramel be patient and always swirl the dish instead of stirring it when the sugar goes brown add the apple that starts to sort of cool down the caramel but it gives it a really nice sort of caramelised puree apple's almost disintegrating smells incredible turn the gas down slice up two apples it's a crumble that's got no frills straight forward no faffing around no peeling of the skin i want them to sort of stand out from the caramel apples in now those nice thick chunks of apple sort of almost bedding itself into the puree dried cranberries gives it that nice sort of shock in the texture sweet and chewy i want it to sort of taste zesty spicy so sip the lemon zest on top of your apples and cranberry fresh lemon juice over and that just gives that extra acidic kick takes the cranberries the apples the caramel and the cinnamon to another level turn the gas off so that that sits and let's concentrate on the crumble flour in a couple of tablespoons of demerara sugar sugar helps to get the topping nice and crispy butter in [Music] give that a nice little rub what we're looking for is like a a bread crumb mixture lightly season it with a touch of cinnamon and the demerara sugar sort of helps to get a nice fine crumble mix and it stops the butter from sort of melting in that flour so that's the basic crumble mix but i'm not finished yet muesli two-thirds crumble one-third muesli mix that in if you haven't got muesli then crunchy granola works brilliantly too lovely now start off in the center and work your way around i want the crispiness on the top the puree on the bottom of the caramel and then the texture in the center a good tip turn the gas back on i want it bubbling before it goes in the oven because then you just got to cook the top so as soon as you see that caramel start to bubble down the side in she goes let's go bake at 200 degrees celsius for 12 to 14 minutes until golden brown smells amazing [Music] beautiful it's still bubbling [Music] and look at it a delicious but very simple crumble with apples at the absolute best beautiful [Music] you

sort of flavors on the outside good quality meat is essential to the success of santa maria so they insist on importing only the very best steaks i think the quality of the meat is argentina is very good because the grass is very good the wettest conditions are fantastic the average time our steak is hanging it's between 20 and 28 days so the days of the meat is very nice for my starter i try some traditional argentine pasties empanadas where are they made here everything homemade the empanadas are start one chicken one beef so savoury not too spicy most of the customers are english yeah

caribbean in huddersfield [Music] discovery bay is a tiny but intriguing restaurant serving caribbean classics like aki and saltfish and curried goats it's owned by barrington douglas what makes discovery beer successful is the relaxed warming atmosphere the light reggae and the soulful vibes in the background you feel as if you're in the caribbean and then when you stab your fork into your meat and you taste it you think you know what these people have put heart soul and passion into everything that we're doing i've been here so many times i've practically worked my way through the menu the food is gorgeous barrington has dedicated his entire life to discovery bay he decided as a teenager that he wanted to open a restaurant and saved up for over 20 years he even remortgaged his house to make his dream come true at the age of 19 i said right every 100 pound i earn i'm gonna put 20 pounds away and the dream was to open a restaurant and after 20 21 years i accumulated the summer money and now i'm living my dream barrington's clearly a man with incredible commitment but is his modern take on caribbean classics good enough for the f word restaurant i sent f word major dj b

restaurants battle out for the america's title but is one team celebrating too early ernesto cynthia you can stop dancing now maybe you can show me a few moves after the main course yeah we're back in london at the f-word restaurants and tonight we're crossing the atlantic and celebrating the amazing flavors of north south and central america after searching for months all over the country we whittle down your nominations to two fantastic restrooms argentine grill house santa maria del sur in south london and caribbean restaurant discovery bay in huddersfield [Music] 25 portions of each is

are cooking chicken and chili empanadas a classic argentinian starter they fill the pastry cases with chicken mixed with peppers onions eggs tomatoes olives and mixed herbs they pinch the cases shut and deep fry until golden they serve with a watercress fennel and chilli salad and garnish with lemon what's the secret behind a really good empanada i think pastry good chicken good flavor easy to made that's it right barrington talk to me yes chef who taught you to cook first who was this there was all boys and um my mum was before i was a bird so she pulled me to one side and showed me how to call can your mum think that you are and she had a special technique with a wooden spoon what was that well at the beginning my mum says um what you need to do you need to watch the part and every time i used to open my mouth and say something excuse me i chose to say it i didn't ask you to talk i asked you to watch the part it worked i think it worked it did discipline discovery bay in huddersfield is run by barrington douglas whose mum taught him everything there is to know about caribbean cuisine my passion for cooking started off at home with my mum cooking there was five boys no girls and there was one day my mum says right i want somebody to learn how to cook so she put me to one side and that's where it started gentle giant barrington is keen to pass on his knowledge he mentors local young people teaching them how to cook it treats me like one of his sons he's like a dead to me and i do anything for him discovery based starter is jerk chicken caesar salad barrington fries chicken marinaded and jerk seasoning made with scotch bonnet peppers garlic black pepper cinnamon nutmeg thyme and allspice he dresses mixed leaf salad in caesar sauce [Music] now barry what's so special about this recipe what is it is the seasoning on the jerk chicken we do a lot of jerk chicken in in the caribbean yes but this is where i'm just trying to bring it to a little bit of a european taste as well with a caesar salad so would you say your interpretation is more modern more modern more modern so more dangerous more dangerous accent in terms of being in the middle of paris it's like a little sort of communal pocket of argentina yeah we are really friendly and we are like a small family yeah yeah we're going to dance and salsa sometimes yeah are you teaching him was he teaching you no he's teaching okay good four more excellent and how old when you first started cooking um my first time seven years old seven years ago what was the first thing you took one it was peak north and south america are stuffed with the most amazing ingredients here's one of the most delicious [Music] canada in the northern tip of the american continent is home to some of the most delicious wildfowl in the world [Music] with christmas coming up and goose one of my favorite festive foods i couldn't be in a better place quebec where almost a million wild snow geese stop off once a year as they migrate south always been a big fan of british goose however the snow goose is a canadian ancestor and they say taste wise is in a completely different league i can't wait to try it i'm in the town of monmoney where snow goose is so famous it's like the local mascot there are thousands here so i'd like to think they only have the best wild snow goose on the local restaurant menus [Music] very light in color that unfortunately was a bit of a letdown i was expecting more of a sort of richer gamier slightly livery flavor that's the kind of goose you can get anywhere certainly not worth coming all the way to quebec for that's for sure this goose has too much fat on it to be a wild delicacy so i want to grill the head chef frederique to find out where it came from how are you all right you yeah rondi thank you happy to be here yeah but then my goose arrived so that is snow geese no that's firemen geese that's farm geese yeah why are you serving me farm geese when you've got hundreds of thousands of them in your front garden because it's illegal illegal it's not legal we eat at home but we can serve at the restaurant we can't serve the restaurants but that's madness from a chef to chef yeah wild yeah it's completely different it's not the same flavor chalk and cheese yeah because the canadian authorities can't monitor the health of wild snow geese they don't allow restaurants like this one to sell it so the only way i can actually go and eat a wild snow goose if i go and shoot the bloody thing myself yeah to maximise my chances of finding a wild snow goose i headed out of town and further up the st lawrence river this vast waterway is 70 kilometers wide and is prime feeding ground for migrating birds daniela chance has been hunting here since he was a child look at them all there's loads of geeks incredible in the area here about five hundred thousand slogans half a million half a million yeah my god all i want to taste is one that's all i want is one arimo island in the middle of the river is one of daniel's best hunting spots we start at 5 a.m the next morning to get into position before the snow geese spot us trudging our way across the riverbed as soon as the tide goes out the tide's gone out and this mud is bloody deep though yeah really bloody [ __ ] my god a few hours ago these hides below ground were buried deep underwater i've done some pretty crazy things in my life in order to get food but i've never done this i sat in the middle of a river in a box holy crap we sit under cover of darkness waiting for the snow geese to fly in so when we see them do we dive down do we it's really really important not to show our faces because they're pretty smart daniel mimics the call of the geese to try and attract passing birds says go no go cheers oh my god it's really with the troll tear there an hour later as the sun begins to burst through the clouds the snow geese start to fly in and arrive on the riverbed in the thousands [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i just wish one or two of them would land near us [Music] but there must be one how many there probably between ten and fifteen thousand snoogies there oh [ __ ] snow geese have incredibly sharp sight and a keen sense of danger which was keeping them well away from us so we've got fifteen thousand geese sat there and five thousand sat there and we're stuck here yeah who put the box here was it the fringe what the [ __ ] all i want is one one little goose [ __ ] it's the distances these wild birds fly that makes their meat lean and delicious to eat but as they move around the river they were proving too clever for us you think it'd be a lot easier to catch them but no they are not easy to cash they are very very intelligent birds plan b if i wanted to taste this amazing delicacy i had no option but to find another hunting spot [Music] hey guys yes all the food's looking fantastic you've got four more away now please yeah yeah i think last time was a four yes yes chef uh barry to make sure the last table is as good as the first table yes yes [ __ ] i wish you baron they look fantastic cynthia always starters out thank you chef brilliant

so special about discovery bay what is it it's the heart and the soul that's gone into the place and how much does tonight mean to him and leaving here as a winner that would mean a lot to barrington and he's took a big risk in his life to put money into the business so um to him this will just put iceland on a cake enjoy main courses i look forward to seeing you after thank you excellent thank you all right empanadas santa maria uh classic a version of a cornish pasty ready chicken chili and olives with a little chili salad banned with some eggs that's delicious really good pastry's nice

guy is ambitious and incredibly confident chicken's really nice the more you eat the chicken the more the intense flavor the joke's teasing really really good two stunning dishes absolutely neck and neck personally if i had to choose one i'd go for the empanada absolutely delicious if the diners don't like their starters they don't pay the results are in right uh barrington um out of 25. how well

discovery bay at discovery bay in huddersfield barrington's menu combines classic carving recipes with european ingredients we've got the specials where i try to fuse food together so we might use pastas linguine rocket leaves barrington's ambitious approach to caribbean dining has been a hit with the yorkshire locals it's lovely it's nice to come into a restaurant and sit and eat the food rather than going to like a caribbean cafe the taste in the food when he does it it's just like something it's just like the mother's cooking it's not better sorry check on thank you one rum park barrington's main course is one of his most popular dishes rum pork with sweet potatoes barrington starts by marinating pork medallions with fresh thyme rosemary black pepper chopped garlic and dark rum for the rum gravy heats up beef stock and adds red green and yellow peppers we've got the red yellow and green so we have got the rasaman colours and the colours of the caribbean islands as well running through there and what we've got here we've got the old jamaica room [Music] daryl dew next he griddles of pork medallions and sliced sweet potato he adds the pork medallions to the rum gravy and finishes with cream he serves with steamed vegetables smells absolutely beautiful awake here and please pork with sweet potatoes served so barrington the secret behind this main course is what it's a stock basically it's a reduction of the stock um a nice little kicker what's the heat at the back that's a little bit of scotch bonnet pepper in there okay when you're standing in front of that grill that's a very difficult thing to operate in battersea how do you get the temperature of the steaks cooked perfectly what is this we need to move the grill to that high you have slow middle depends how good the people want so you're not touching the stakes it's all with this yes your tongue is the same when you touch your hands yep when you touch here yep right yeah yep here's what santa maria are cooking tonight at santa maria del sur in south london they use only the finest argentinian beef i think argentinian beef is one of the best in the world because we have so much nice grass nice weather the way the cows eat the way they live makes the beef that tasty and tender you can really taste the difference to any other beef that you can eat this is really excellent table five santa maria's signature dish tonight is argentinian ribeye steak with chimichurri sauce [Music] for the chimichurri ernesto chops parsley and garlic and blends with olive oil something really very nice he adds bay leaves ground sweet red pepper oregano sea salt and mixes he stirs in warm water to infuse the flavors he finishes with white wine vinegar and chopped red onion the chimichurri is the real tasty sauce from argentina ernesto char grills an argentinian ribeye steak and seasons with olive oil and sea salt not too much he serves with a rocket and sugar snap salad dresses with toasted sesame and sunflower seeds chimichurri sauce on the side and garnish the steak with a slice of roasted red pepper now it's done argentinian ribeye steak with chimichurri sauce served health and safety have banned me from having an open fire in my kitchen so i've had a special grill installed why did you choose a ribeye over a fillet or a sirloin because the fat has special flavor and what makes argentinian beef so special what is it about the wettest conditions and is it one of the best meats in the world i think it's the best do you think it's the best yes why not you think it's better than scottish yes you may be better than as a football but i don't know about the steaks however we'll find out later yes yeah yeah bloody smoke in here what we've done to my kitchen it's always like this yes what's the material time all the time all the time honestly it's like you're sending smoke signals huh is that trying to put barrington off what's all that about no yes that's right unless so you happy with them yes they look fantastic yeah away please tell me one let's go now cynthia you have six now three minutes the next table thank you right now back to canada i'm in quebec in north america on the hunt for one of the most delicious birds in the world the snow goose almost a million descend on the salons river for a few weeks each year so far i've had little luck shooting one [Music] a new day and daniel takes me to a new hunting spot this time thankfully on dry land so why don't you bring me here yesterday in a nice little sort of bunker than being sat in the middle of a river sometimes it's better there sometimes it's better here it feels right here yeah well we're uh we're well placed and it's getting nice and white over there isn't it yeah they began to be maybe two or three thousand now so when they fly over i can shoot any one if you want to eat it yeah the gray ones are much more better because they are more tender because they're the youngsters exactly yeah we've just made it 10 times more difficult so it's not just about shooting a snowgies no he's looking for the grey ones exactly young grey geese have migrated fewer miles than older birds so the meat is more tender it isn't long before we get our first chance chew miss that but not bad order will come they're looking good these ones here ready aiming for a straight goose on the move is the best way to ensure we hit just one with a clean shot and finally one came our way oh sure got him [Music] yes yeah [ __ ] i've got my goose but was it the right age and the very best to eat brilliant ah perfect young one for one young wife my god look at that baby there well and how young is that is that the perfect age it's a it's a fresh fresh snow goose of the of the year honestly i'm so pleased to get one that's brilliantly we got one finally ah we got excellent well done beautiful woods huh before i can cook snow goose for the first time daniel shows me how to de-breast the bird now to get the breasts off you just have to pull like that and see everything is coming it's incredible and look how thin that fat is there's hardly any fat on there a lot darker than i expected yeah it's like a red brown meat yeah like venison and the breasts are quite thick as well i thought i thought they'd be thinner close to an inch yup it's incredible christmas is fast approaching and goose is one of my favorite birds to cook and i've got a recipe that'll bring out this wild meat's rich gamey flavor perfectly this is the first for me a delicious lean snow goose breast with a rich red wine tomato sauce finished with sweet potatoes onions and garlic first slice the potatoes and par boil with olive oil and a bit of salt pan on for the goose season the snow goose and fry it with rosemary garlic and butter once it's beautifully colored take it out of the pan now to go with a snow goose under a really nice red wine tomato sauce fry some chopped onions and garlic nice then add red wine to the pan really important to reduce the red wine down to a syrup otherwise you've got that sort of raw alcohol flavor in the sauce add chopped tomatoes and chicken stock and then the snow goose goes back to finish cooking with some butter the butter gives the sauce a nice glaze the snow goose is rich so the soda potatoes will be very simple now the secret to get our skin really nice and crispy they're fried with some chopped onion garlic thyme and butter slice the snow goose nice and thinly now put the sauce on top this is definitely one of the most exciting ingredients i've ever cooked i can't wait to try it that is so delicate yeah incredibly tender it's really delicious yeah it's really great that's given me a completely different taste and experience than i ever could imagine it smells delicious it tastes delicious and also it's very healthy yeah because it's no fat no fat i'm really really really happy with that and what an amazing discovery and thank you i just need one more favor i need to redirect the snow goose via scotland so i don't have to travel so far next time that is incredible but that's really great yeah really good okay good ernesto cynthia last table

delicious very tender um i like the sauce that was with the chimichurri i hadn't tried that before so it was nice to try that the steak was lush i don't usually like rare steak to be honest with you but um changed my views probably right argentinian beef santa maria briefly cooked lovely colour sauce a little bit of grilled pepper on there that is cooked perfectly it's incredibly juicy mmm and packed full of flavor salad unfortunately a little bit bland slightly boring it's not very nice eating raw onion with the most amazing steak however ernesto really knows your stuff that is perfection

flavors work really well so don't be precious this is gutsy cooking at its absolute best these are lamb breasts a beautiful cheap cut and it's sort of tucked alongside the rib they've been boned out the skin has been taken off i'm going to roll them stuff them and braise them braising simply means cooking in liquid on a low heat making the meat divinely tender now open them up and give them a really good season season them both sides inside and out really important it doesn't look like a real weighty dense cut of meat but once it's beautifully slow braised it's just like melting lamb it's incredible i'm gonna season the breasts with some dried oregano put a heat in there some chili flakes [Music] lemon zest put some amazing salted anchovies in there now they almost melt inside the lamb so the balance of flavors work beautifully now pull it down towards you and roll that nice and tightly that's what i'm looking for string i just need to tie them three times one at each end and one in the middle i fell in love with this dish years ago when i first started working in paris because we had all the lamin from the pyrenees the nice thing is they can be done the day before pan on olive oil in get their oil nice and hot lamb in really important to get some nice color on there whilst they're browning slice the onion the lamb's gonna be cooking for two and a half hours so don't slice the onions too thinly otherwise they'll burn garlic and leave whole got a color on them look at that beautiful take them out onions in and garlic straight in lovely that's the secret about slow braising you never change pans why all the goodness is in that one pan a few chili seeds in there oregano nice pinch a little bit of lemon in there i'm gonna do the onions what i did to the lamb [Music] next my capers fry them off get them exploding the bottom of the pan they get nice and crispy next my black olives now white wine bring that up to the boil deglazing the pan as well i rinse in the bottom of that pan and now the flavour in there it's just extraordinary now where that tomatoes [Music] puncher those plum tomatoes then simply place the lamb breast back in the pot and remember to taste [Music] that's nice [Music] lid on into the oven 170 two two and a half hours and forget about it [Music] whoa beautiful all that has reduced down to this amazing nice tomato sauce and the lamb has kept its color look at that it's braised beautifully very carefully get your little bits there slice off pull off the little bits of string this is why i get really excited the secret is not to slice it too thinly look at that i can smell the lemon it's hard to believe when you slice through the center there that that is a very cheap cut of meat i'm salivating i love this i mean it's just incredible pick up the tomatoes and the olives and the onions an amazing rich sauce take your lamb sort of just sit it on it looks incredible and that for me is why chefs get so excited with cheap cuts because the end results are incredible delicious breast of lamb with lemon anchovies chili and oregano a devilishly indulgent dessert nothing beats a great cake a sort of a show-off trophy for party food so i'm going to make the most amazing flowerless chocolate cake but with a twist first thing first make the caramel flatten the sugar never stir a caramel rule number one now keep the pan nice and flat i'm gonna flavor this caramel with a little bit of mint give it a little chop sprinkle that into the caramel don't get the caramel too dark just nice and light a little teaspoon of oil onto the tray and rub that in and then pour out your caramel if i was making a caramel sauce then i'd put butter and cream into the caramel but i want this nice minted brittle running through my cake whilst the caramel cools down on the tray i'm gonna make my cake first melt good quality dark chocolate in a bain-marie heating it directly in the pan would destroy the cocoa fats always in a bowl over boiling water in a mixing bowl sugar two whole eggs and three egg yolks whisk until beautifully light and creamy and the color changes to a light yellow the more you mix the eggs and the sugar the lighter that texture in the center of the chocolate cake next melt some butter into your warm dark chocolate and stir was that really nice sheen velvety rich and tasting amazing add that to your sugar and your eggs now give that a really good mix now when you're making flourless desserts it really is important to work harder incorporating the air especially with the yolks and the sugar that natural height needs to take place at the beginning look at that looks like the perfect chocolate ganache then separate four egg whites into a bowl [Music] now make sure you've got two-thirds of the way there with your whites and then just sprinkle in your sugar it's almost like a meringue and the firmer you make these now the more it will elevate your cake in the oven [Music] that's what you call a stiff peak in with the whites before i start mixing that i'm gonna get my caramel just start breaking that up it's like glass sheets of glass beautiful save some of your minty caramel shards for decoration and use a rolling pin to break up the rest into small pieces sprinkle that in so as we start to slice that chocolate cake you'll come across that nice crunch take your cake tin make sure it's lined with the greaseproof paper on the bottom nicely greased pour this in a few sharp taps on a hard surface will rid your cake mixture of any air pockets that could create holes in your cake sit that in the oven 180. after 35 minutes my chocolate mint cake is cooked and whilst it cools down i can whip up a peppermint cream topping [Music] add sifted icing sugar and a few drops of peppermint extract to double cream and whisk until it's just holding its shape your minty cream on top of the cake leaving a small border free to make it easier to cut for a cake that can't fail to attract attention at your party scatter over the remaining caramel mint shards we've got aromatic lean lamb chops with char grilled broccoli and burger wheat salad for dessert it's healthy mango sundae holly [Music] then i can help daddy with the dessert yes please and the lamb cutlets now we all know that you love desserts yeah yeah we'll do a little yogurt parfait with some macerated fruits so the first thing i'd like you to do is take a tablespoon of icing sugar dust that over the fruits good now sad enough that's perfect daddy thank you zest the orange over the fruits and what's going to happen now is going to start to sort of marinate i'm going to put some basil in there that'll make it really flavoursome fresh basil in and then i'm going to give that a little mix up i'm going to squeeze some fresh orange juice in there nice and gently okay how gorgeous do those berries look now okay so we just leave them just marinate okay and that's what we call macerated berries now for the mango sundae right mangoes in place i love mangoes nice now they're naturally sweet okay one oh that smells incredible now how fresh does that smell very no you love art right yeah i do so you're gonna put these together so a nice little dollop of mango at the bottom nice and slowly once each glass has a layer of mango puree at the bottom spoon over a layer of thick natural yogurt and alternate until the glass is full well done now it's yummy from there you get your berries you sit your berries on top they taste so fresh but now they've been marinated and the berries have been slightly macerated and then finally look get your icing sugar and just tap on top they look it's beautiful now they sit in the fridge to get nice and chilled okay so if i take three and promise not to sneeze and you take one open the fridge door good job desserts chilling in the fridge now for the super simple main course to go with the aromatic lamb chops a tasty char grill broccoli and bulgur wheat salad to cook the bulgur wheat just simmer until tender then drain to give the broccoli a char grilled flavor simply cook with salt in a hot dry pan until smoky and tender for a quick and easy aromatic dressing mixed together harissa paste with either buttermilk or creme fraiche and add chopped mint simple as that to serve thoroughly dress your broccoli and burger wheat and finish with more fresh mint leaves dessert ready and salad's done now for the aromatic grilled lamb chops how much do you love lamb holes a lot a lot on a scale of one to ten ten okay these lamb chops are gonna be

taste amazing but more importantly they are so simple to do pan on for the stuffing it's a saddle of lamb basically a sort of rolls-royce cut perfectly shaped and it suits stuffing to an absolute tea for the stuffing finely chop an onion garlic nice thin slices oil in onions and garlic in [Music] salt and pepper make sure the stuffing is beautifully seasoned so it helps to season the inside of the lamp now we've got the color on those onions we're going to throw in some pine nuts and that helps to give a bit of a texture here's where it starts getting really exciting spinach in and just lay the spinach over the pine nuts it looks like a lot of spinach that's going to condense and disappear almost instantly there's so much more flavor and spinach when you saute it as opposed to steaming it or boiling it gas off look at that now to bring that together no eggs no breadcrumbs crumbled feta over the spinach feta cheese adds a beautifully salty sharp and creamy flavor what this does it brings our stuffing together now open up the lamb keep those little fillets to the side that's the channel that we want to stuff so i want to just open that up a little bit there salt and pepper lightly and before we put our stuffing in we're going to season it with sour sumac is a wonderful lemony spice that goes brilliantly with lamb and you can get it in most big supermarkets and it sort of cuts through that thick rich sweetness of the lamb open up that lamb there take a spoon if you're preparing this for the day ahead then let the stuffing cool down it's inevitable when you start rolling it and tying it something's gonna squeeze out so load up the ends take these beauties these little fillets and just support that stuffing and sort of increase that beautiful tunnel and then from there over there and bring that towards you and then roll like i said some of the stuff is going to come out now to tie it first off around the side and don't worry about some flash butcher's knot just tie it one in the middle you can get butcher's string from your local butcher or at cookware shops i got two ties go to thai it just forces all that stuffing out of the lamb when it's in the oven nice now we'll just season the top of it roll the joint to make sure all the skin gets seasoned now you think normally that just goes in the oven like that that's how my mum would do it but get your tray onto the gas oil in get it really nicely colored none of your stuffing is coming out the sides really important look at that color beautiful it does kick start the roasting process gas off into the oven cook for 45 to 55 minutes depending on how pink you want your lamb lift the lamb out of the fat to rest resting it raised up in the tin will stop it cooking but not cool it down too quickly and means you won't lose any of those lovely juices next i'm making a simple but sophisticated accompaniment for the lamb top and tail the cucumber peel it cut the cucumber into three and just core taking out all that it's just sort of watery seedy and it spoils the flavor slice the cucumber cucumber in really nice way of making a cheap and cheerful cucumber look glamorous we're gonna dress that cucumber with a nice fresh yogurt couple of tablespoons next some fresh mint dressing a touch of salt a touch of pepper and then pomegranate molasses that just sweetens it up finish that with lemon mix that up lamb it's rested carefully take off the string and then just gently pull them back straighted edge knife that's going to cut through that crispy fat on the outside instantly i tied it purposely so i can get my portion control from the lines hold it nice and firmly look at your line where the string was and look this one is going to be amazing lay and down just in those two slices there it proves that stuffing meat is for special occasions because that is a saddle of lamb at its absolute best stuffing meats and fish not only makes them look fantastic it also gives them an extra added flavor dimension too once you've mastered the technique you'll be able to turn out dishes that will guarantee you'll have an unforgettable feast slow-cooked fiery lamb cooking is all about being bold and adventurous and this dish is exciting because it's slowly cooked and the longer it cooks the more flavoursome it becomes marinating the lamb first chilis we're gonna use a mixture of red and green take off the tops and just slice in garlic crushed don't worry about chopping these ultra fine just get it in there cooking for up to three hours everything sort of blends and almost sort of purees itself together smoked paprika goes brilliantly well with the chilis two teaspoons in a touch of dried oregano some little cumin seeds the blend and the fragrance that they give out is extraordinary they release a little oil as well and helps to tenderize the lamb a touch of salt pepper cinnamon that sort of sweetens up the lamb olive oil just a tablespoon and the olive oil helps to sort of stick all those wonderful spices to the lamb jump in just start really rubbing at this stage you can leave the lamb to marinade for anything from half an hour to overnight allowing the spices to really penetrate the meat giving amazing results when you tuck in delicious vegetables carrots and onions and that's it sliced secret slicing vegetables from braising is not getting too thin you slice the onions too thin they burn you've got that horrible char taste on that slow braised braising it's just a chef's term that means cooking in liquid on a low heat making the meat incredibly moist and beautifully tender so the secret of braising is having a really nice thick durable pan get that nice and hot just a touch of olive oil lamb in hold the bone because you're in control then into the pan i want that white fat to start rendering so it'll add more fat therefore making it a lot more flavoursome as it braises chilies cinnamon in mix that up and don't be scared you're not burning this you're sort of searing the lamb shanks and this is the important part right at the very beginning we're getting the collar on the lamb which washes off as it braises in the oven so be generous with that color vegetables in wow and then a couple of baileys so now you lift the lamb up and get the lamb sat on top of the vegetables now just glaze the pan with red wine this glazing means that you're you're cleaning the bottom of the pan and you're getting that amazing flavor washed off and lifted up into that sauce can really transform that dish always delays then bring to the boil and cook for about 10 minutes to reduce the wines reduce down by half now for the stock bring that stock back up to the ball and then into the oven now don't cover it when you cover it all the condensation comes off the lid your lamb becomes gray all this effort and that exciting spice gets washed away no lid and in the oven for three hours a slow cook on a low heat of 160 degrees gives the spices time to work and transform the meat so it's mouthwateringly tender now look at those out on to a plate you can just see that meat sliding down juicy and incredibly tender grab it by the the shank rolling around that rich delicious sauce look at that and get your sauce nice beautiful just get some mint don't chop it just pick that fresh mint and let it snow and there you go a very spicy delicious melting in the mouth lamb shank amazing sponge with fresh ginger bacon is part chemistry part imagination but you've got to rely on the rules for great results the only time you'll see me reaching for the scales first off eggs sugar butter and when i say weigh out the ingredients it does literally mean way out to the final gram 175 now 175 grams of sugar that's 350 grams in total cream the butter and the sugar to get a delicious light sponge start carefully on slow speed [Music] only speed up as the butter and sugar really start to cream together keep that really nice and light you can see how it's changed color so important at the beginning eggs in give me a little whisk adding one egg at a time stops the mix from separating second egg in third one in [Music] that's what we're looking for a really nice sort of light airy texture now i'm gonna flavor the sponge a little teaspoon of vanilla extract that perfumes the mix one teaspoon of baking powder that gives lightness 175 grams of flour and we're going to sieve it a to get rid of any lumps and b to keep it really nice and fine 175. we're not going to beat that out we're just going to lightly fold that in now what i'm looking for is a really nice loose dough that's looking a little bit too firm so just a little splash of milk a couple of tablespoons that relaxes the mixture down helps create that nice almost dropping consistency that's what i want just starting to drop take a non-stick loose bottom cake tin grease it with butter then coat it with flour to avoid the sponge sticking just give that a little shake make sure you get all the rim now just get the back of the spatula make sure you've got no peaks on my sponge to make sure the sponge bakes nice and evenly tap the tin a few times to knock out any air pockets that might have formed in the mixture now into the oven bake for 30 to 35 minutes at 180 degrees as that's cooking prepare the ginger cream for the center 300ml of cream give that a nice whisk whisking the cream by hand gives you so much more control and it's so easy to over whipped cream i want that nice light ginger cream in the center i don't want it grainy nothing worse when cream starts to separate now let's get into that three-quarter stage little stiff peaks stop that for two minutes fresh ginger now get a really nice large slice of ginger smells incredible it's so fragrant good green ginger is like sort of peeling a potato just take out all those little dark spots now get your grater you haven't gotten grater you can chop the ginger really finely i've gone almost like a puree of ginger going through but the juice as well take your knife and just scrape all that taste incredible it's fragrant it's not sweet it's got a really nice taste set that in the fridge [Music] smells incredible run a knife around the outside to ensure the cake doesn't stick to the tin before turning it out now get your hands under push up and out while your cake cools i'm gonna do like a really nice sweet chocolate coating pour 300 mils of double cream into a saucepan add two tablespoons of golden syrup to make the top nice and glossy then whisk chop this up really thinly so as it melts quickly 50 grams of butter that's gonna give the chocolate a really nice shine ball your cream and mix it in give that a really good stir as the chocolate the butter melts it thickens like how shiny that is it's so nice to finish something sweet on top topping done time to build your sponge cake look at the halfway mark there and just gently slice and really take your time all the way through lift that's delicious a nice big dollop in the middle don't be stingy don't be tight with a cream another dollop on top spread that very carefully lift the lid and just sit that on top that's why i start off with a little extra cream in there so i squash it down the cream just pushes out to the side i'm not finished pour the luxurious chocolate topping over the sponge be generous and make sure the cake is coated thoroughly to give it a gorgeous finish get the bottom of the ladle and spread whoa one more [Music] wow you've got to know when to say stop and something looks that delicious i just want to dive in there wonderful baked cheesecake for me food always has to be impressive but when it comes to desserts often you see spun sugar or wild decorations remember simple is always the most impressive this cheesecake is so straightforward yet so delicious now cream cheese leave it out the fridge for five or ten minutes go nice and soft trust me your arms will be thanking you sugar in this cheesecake is the new york cheesecake because it's baked so there's no base start creaming the cheese and the sugar spending the amount of time i do in the states if there's one thing they know how to do out there is the most amazing impressive cheesecake rich delicious but so simple work the bowl lift the bowl to your advantage whisk whisk whisk whisk lovely nice and creamy now get your eggs add the eggs to the mixture bit by bit doing it this way it's more efficient hey you're incorporating a lot of air b the mixture doesn't separate lastly your egg lovely of course you can use electric mixer but why go to the gym we can just make a cheesecake a day a cheesecake a day keep the bingo wings away now a couple of tablespoons of flour give it a whisk stop something going lumpy now i want to scent that cheesecake i've got the freshness zest of the lemon in there i want to sort of tart it up even more fold in some fresh raspberries so just mix them through be careful to crush them then grease a cake tin with butter this will ensure your cheesecake slides out beautifully get your mix let that fall in now take your cake tin and just tap it the mixture hits the bottom of the cake tin the raspberries rise and you've got raspberries at the top the middle and the bottom it also stops all these little pockets of air trapping underneath the mixture in the cake tin there's no holes in the cheesecake now into the oven 180 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes [Music] slightly souffled up pull off [Music] that's the color i wanted on top and look at it it's one of the simplest yet the most stylish cheesecakes anywhere beautiful [Music]

uh the saffron now that chef aurelio is here for dinner gordon has an opportunity to see if the restaurant food is any better when the chef is around did you see the fridge yeah yeah anything to say or no i don't know nothing to say it's my fault he knows it's my fault i guess it is it is my responsibility after all i'm just cooked i'm not interested i can do whatever i want here so you know that's why i never go somewhere else i need pants pants i need pants do you have some more pants ready no the chef had to put the stuff back in the fridge they didn't why are you scared of the chefs uh because if they leave nobody gonna be served aurelio is one of those entities in my life that i can live with and i can live without i'm tired dude we have uh mediterranean platters like hummus tabbouleh that's great i've gone for pita that's not good it's too heavy it's not the worst it's not the best though it's an hour into service and dinner conversation at this restaurant is primarily about the poor food we might afford whatever you know will you excited about eating healthily this evening no we're not very happy with this no right having heard the general sentiment of the customers gordon heads back to the kitchen to get to the root of the problem jesus christ oh my god oh my god and what is that what's going on all together and duck it's duck but it's fake fake duck fake duck so you call it what we call untuck under under right now i feel like i'm getting completely [ __ ] is that popular yeah it is actually a lot of people ask for that too [Music] [ __ ] duck [ __ ] ass fake fish fight fish and it looks like fish and tastes like fish and it's got seaweed on on the outside we have everything that's on this is incredible so far i've had under unfished and unfucking believable what a mess not my favorite no hey god bless los angeles after a disappointing dinner service thank you so much i hope you guys see you guys again thanks again have a great week gordon confronts the staff with the harsh reality of the situation i'm somewhat confused um nobody seems to take and accept responsibility everybody's a free-for-all no rules no one's fear for the job just a lack of care i think a manager needs to make sure that things happen all these things that are unattended to i i have to take blame for it's all me for some reason people are not listening to me my management style is not functional it's not working let me tell you yeah what the problem is here at sonte lack of management yeah that's clear that's happening but let me tell you the biggest problem here the biggest problem here is the food not just the food it's the [ __ ] everything's a gimmick on chicken and duck your philosophy is not healthy style the [ __ ] i uncovered in the freezer the discovery in the fridge you've got grass hanging from the ceiling it's like [ __ ] lord of the flies up there have you seen this [ __ ] hovering around there i am not going any further until this place is [ __ ] clean and i mean spotless if a health inspector had witnessed one eyewitness just in one of the fridges bang game over clean this [ __ ] pigsty this place does not deserve an a and the only thing you're getting from me tonight is that an f there they're staying on and guys i'll take it down tomorrow personally yeah when it's up to the standard of an a now move your

staff worked through the night the flight's coming out of this one cleaning every inch of the restaurant i certainly was gonna have gordon come through and say what is the matter here did you not

nominations it's clear you go loco for tapas so i asked my f word team to help me whittle down your nominations to find the very best spanish contenders street fight aubergine's best thing we're traveling across the country really putting these nominated restaurants under severe scrutiny you nominated spanish restaurants from scotland to portsmouth and we went to visit the places you loved to eat as we searched it soon became clear that two restaurants were in a league of their own in ripond and west yorkshire el gato negro is a very spanish restaurant run by a very passionate northerner i suppose you want to expect a northerner to be cooking spanish food but you know it works and i love it i love the products i love i love the people i love the food and so you know we're passionate about it simon shaw has an impressive pedigree he was the executive chef of harvey nichols in london but gave up at glamorous city life to open a spanish restaurant in the country there's nothing

the right place for us local lad matt healy is the sous chef he knows the quality of elgato negro's cuisine can win over any critic if somebody said to me two lads from north shouldn't be cooking tapas i'd say book a table a little gatorade on a saturday night and it'll change your mind head chef simon co-owns the restaurant with flamboyant welshman chris williams a former colleague from harvey nix sam and i can have a very temp tempestuous relationship to remain i can flip but so consignment faced with so many tempting dishes i want to taste a bit of everything starting with the anchovy crostini good food pretty good food uh clean great flavors simply done more of a traditional spanish tapas and um yeah fast this is cooked freshly great flavors great balance one hell of a

south london is home to lola rocco a short walk from where i live [Music] it's a modern spanish restaurant run by antonio and christina antonio and i we got together because of the love for food the fiery couple from barcelona have a passionate relationship in and out of the kitchen i went into the kitchen and he shouted to me you know get me this and get me that and i said you shut up okay

years they've been here for three years i've never even noticed them and that's what this competition is all about yeah unsung heroes cooking authentic proper spanish tapas like that deserve to be recognised [Music] so i've chosen two remarkable spanish restaurants from your nominations will the f-word diners prefer elgato negro's classic tapas or lola rocco's contemporary menu he'll be crowned the f word's best local spanish restaurant we're about to find out we're back in london at the f word restaurant and tonight we're going spanish after searching for months all over the country we whittle down your nominations to find the f-word's best two local spanish restaurants el gato negra in yorkshire and lolo rocco in south london okay guys antonio four covers on table one please four prawns four fish shoe for chiros yeah excellent elgato standby don't stop working yeah on order five kills double five five prawns yes five sea bass five curios chef yes chef thank you right simon the secret behind these prawns yeah i mean for me i like a lot of caramelization on them you really want to taste that char grill flavor yeah you left the heads on why is that yeah there's all the good flavors in it great flavor in the head good as a northerner simon has a no-nonsense approach to spanish tapas el gato negro may be in the yorkshire countryside but simon's determined to bring home the taste of spain a lot of people that come here actually ask if this chef spanish so to be able to say actually no he's from actually he's quite good [Music] elgato for me to like a little slice of barcelona in west yorkshire which you just would not expect it's a delight to have it so close to where we live for el gato negro starter simon marinates prawns in lemon garlic and thyme and then griddles them he saute them in chorizo butter and serve them with frittata sauce parsley oil and balsamic vinegar drizzling over the remaining chorizo butter what's in the butter in the butter uh fine diced chili paprika chorizo cabernet sauvignon vinegar yeah and uh red wine and the sausage the puree of the of sausage just just just put in the oven under salamander very gently just to release the oils out of it don't cook it too much and then you're blitzing it and passing through this blizzard antonio would you say that simon's flavor is better we like the the the plain flavor no that is spicy or strong and sometimes sometimes yeah yeah the chorizo yes the chorizo is for beginners you know for beginners yeah yeah so he's like a child so it's like your baby yeah okay got it yeah excellent so i didn't realize that you were connected to antonio because you said you cooked like a baby well like you smelly two tooths yeah chorizo's for beginners antonio has a unique contemporary style of cooking opening a restaurant has been antonio's dream since he was a child growing up in spain the family-run business has a warm atmosphere which is a big hit with the locals they love antonio's authentic tapas with a modern twist it is the best tapas i have ever had in london for antonio starter he coats king prawns in flour dips them in batter and deep fries he skews a hole in the prawns and inserts a pipette of chive mayonnaise the prawns are served on a bed of wild salad and a side of tomato and red pepper pepperoni what was the feedback from your customers when they saw a pipette sticking out of their prawns some people see and say and the wall is green now so the paprika at the end what kind of paprika is that what is that it's the picante that's a smoked paprika yeah yeah yeah yeah is that class for beginners as well paprika or not yeah the hot paprika yes [ __ ] you know you can't win either way can you cerrito yeah paprika if you beat him tonight you can have a big [ __ ] smile on your face from here to here the biggest box of paprika and the biggest package you've ever seen i'm going to send them to you in the post very nice they look beautiful they all look like they're spreading little green trees right in spain goose barnacles are known as the truffles of the sea and here's why [Music] the atlantic ocean is a chef's dream galithia on the northwest coast of spain is home to classic spanish ingredients like prawns but that's not all these waters are bursting with some of the best seafood in the world the only problem is the spanish don't like exporting it so if you really want to try it you've got to come here and taste it for yourself this region is famous for seafood and there's a shellfish poplar with the locals you'll only find in a few places around the world now these are a huge delicacy here petha bears commonly known as goose barnacles now let's be honest they don't exactly look like the most appetizing of seafood do they i think they look more like [ __ ] janet's reporters toenails however the secret here is to just twist quickly and and out comes this amazing delicacy flavor in terms of taste delicious cross between a razor clam and a sort of cockle stroke muscle and here's the good news 300 euros a kilo full bowl of toenails wow these incredibly expensive shellfish may look weird but they taste delicious the big question is why do they cost three times more than fresh lobster it all became clear when i met up with local fisherman andres in a secret location further up the coast now what in the hell are they doing down there they're collecting per service actually my gosh it is mad it is crazy so what they're doing they're just dangling over the side of the the rock yeah they keep jumping from one rock to another and uh collecting from there actually it's it's very very dangerous and many people have died collecting perseverance many people don't yeah many people are here the way he jumps i mean it's so [ __ ] dangerous now yeah it is it is actually i wouldn't do it myself this amazing delicacy is found below the water line stuck firm to the foot of the craggy spanish coast but dodging the waves like a matador seemed a step too far even for these exquisite little shellfish and this spot wasn't actually where the best ones were hiding this was how in the [ __ ] do you get down there the goose barnacles were at the bottom of this 300 foot cliff deep beneath the crashing waves fishermen like angel and javier risk their lives almost every day to get their hands on them is that's where the best ones are it says good ones in there the more they enjoy the best first service the more dangerous yeah yeah you're you need to see a doctor the more the goose barnacles are pounded by the waves the more muscle they need to cling onto the cliff so the juicier fatter and tastier they become how you get them off the rocks because they they're attached hard that's for taking tires off a car no now you you hit the rock and the idea with pessimists is to get a bit of uh rock underneath them so they don't die straight away is that right so crowbar oh [ __ ] and the pouch at the side yeah yeah yeah that's all they take that's it yeah that's it and a pair of converse and a pair of combos oh [ __ ] these are certainly one of the most extraordinary delicacies i've ever come across my god all i have to do is survive long enough to get my hands on them this could be the most dangerous thing i've ever done okay simon last table yeah good yeah it's not a race geyser not a race every plate that went out from this kitchen look fantastic yeah really good job yeah well done thank you antonio well done okay for the prawns um the chorizo i thought might overpower um the flavor of the prawns but it didn't at all it was like an infusion it was perfect i could have eaten it again i thought the dish was actually really good i thought the presentation was quite nice um the only thing i would say is although the prawns were quite well cooked the churritso butter wasn't that flavoursome [Music] good to see you welcome therefore thank you very much nice to see you all how do you think antonio's do very well does it make you feel incredibly proud and in terms of the prawns you ate tonight how were they i wouldn't mix chorizo with seafood because chorizo is very overpowering but i didn't taste the chorizo at all right so i don't quite understand the dish in fact i decided not to pay for that wow enjoying main courses yes nice to see thank you lovely really nice um we like the way it was presented with the pipettes the prawns were lukewarm the batter was undercooked and the novelty factor of the pipettes not really hi chris good to see you very much how are you thank you very much enjoy the food the batter was a bit soggy for me in terms of the modern twist on a spanish dish with a pipette is that something that works for you or do you think it's a little bit too once i got into it but i just wasn't sure what you had to do with it the big question is are you going to pay for them no no good to see you thank you have you enjoyed the main courses honestly you're like one of those humbugs that you don't stop sucking in terms of presentation they both look fantastic you've got the rustic old-fashioned charm and this one here and with a modern twist the secret is to get the pipette squeeze and pull and then into the mouth that's delicious really delicious it's quite interesting that chive mayonnaise against that crispy batter the sweetness of the prawn that works very very well right elgatos these are cooked on a skewer the fresh tomato sauce at the bottom the idea is to squeeze the juice out the head mix that in with the tomato and then dip the prawn really good flavor and the tomato sauce works with the sweetness of the prawn however my only slight concern with this plate is there's oil everywhere if it was down to me i'd go for the prawns with a pepper they've tried something really adventurous here and i have to say with a chai mayonnaise it does work lovely but it's not up to me whoever has the most diners paying for the food tonight will be crowned the f words best local spanish restaurant first of all before we get the results yeah i tried both issues i thought they were fantastic okay let's find out how you did uh jb please the results so let's start off with elgato nego simon and matt the number of customers out of 25 that are happy to pay yeah for their starters is wow 19 out of 25 well done that's very good very good indeed now feedback jb give it a spice in the tourism so they wanted more spice the ones that didn't play the six steadier on the season 19 loved it clearly yeah okay good great start 19 out of 25. okay the number of customers out of 25 that are willing to pay for your starter is wow wow wow wow that is a surprise nine out of 25. why too soggy soggy yeah the salad or the batter no the batter the batter yeah i thought those prawns were delicious i loved that little modern twist of the pepper i thought that was unique but you must keep that batter crispy yeah do not drop your head now that was only 25 to cook for now you've got 50 to cook for clear down yeah get ready for the main course well done now both restaurants are going to be cooking their main courses first up lola in their rojo london restaurant antonio and christina are determined to make their food authentic the idea of the restaurant was to mix very traditional tapas on a contemporary way everything made from scratch they serve octopus fresh from golithia and suckling pig from salamanca coming from barcelona antonio and christina have a passion for seafood so their signature dish tonight is costa brava fish stew antonio starts by dusting the turbot and sea bass fillets in flour salt and pepper he fries the fish adding chopped onion garlic and paprika it's nice for the color and it's nice for the flavor next he grates the tomato you use the plum tomato because the flavor of this tomato i think is better he adds fish stock some bold potatoes and clams to thicken the stew antonio creates a picada paste he mixes saffron roast almonds fried bread garlic and flat leaf parsley grinds into a paste and adds it to the stew it's simmered for a minute and is ready to go servies so antonio the name of the restaurant came from where my first girlfriend your first girlfriend you named your restaurant of your first girlfriend and does christina know that no simon the secret behind this dish what is it uh it's a combination of soup yeah and the uh sour dressing of the vinaigrette yeah the texture in it as well here's what el gato negro is cooking tonight el gato negro is a tiny tapas restaurant in rippendon but head chef simon has huge aspirations in his london days he had 35 chefs working for him but now with a small team of four simon relies heavily on right-hand man matt stick him in front of the stove and just wind him up when he goes all night so he's right he's perfect so he's got the looks and i've got the brains i've always sort of had the passion and desire to [ __ ] being able to cook but simon has just pushed me that little bit further like he said he's got the brains and i've got the look so let's make lots of money you know what i mean check on boys elgato negro signature dish is sea bass with a warm potato rosemary and olive oil soup first simon fry's sliced charlotte potatoes in butter with baby spinach for the soup he sweats down chopped shallots and garlic next he adds peeled and sliced potatoes rosemary and fish top and simmers for 15 minutes he blends and sits the mix adding olive oil and seasoning to skin the tomatoes he blanches them in boiling water i normally count 14 seconds that won't be out loud that'll be in my head for the vinaigrette he reduces cherry vinegar then adds sultanas olive oil toasted pine nuts the diced tomatoes and chopped parsley he seasons the sea bass and fries till golden i want to stay nice and straight [Music] sea bass with a warm potato rosemary and olive oil soup served so simon you're mixing the veggie spinach in with the potatoes last minute yeah this is a bit 1970s using rings yeah i just i just want it to fall because it's got a soup in there okay excellent antonio would you put spanish food in a ring no not too much no not too much the only ring you put is on your wife's finger yes i love that paprika there's a smoked paprika yes it's mug paprika but i thought with the starter you told me you didn't like smoked paprika yeah paprika chef hey only for this for this dish yeah is that it you happy with that that's it yeah okay that looks fantastic well done yeah really good okay well done well done well done should we go please cross it off please let's go so the english are beating the spanish at their own game do you think your wife christina will leave you if you lose to the english she's very passionate yeah yeah she's very well if she does leave you can always go back to your ex-girlfriend lola can't you huh very nice thank you that looks lovely go well done good table one please now six more this is fascinating and tony had a really bad start and his head went down and sort of started to become a little bit more demoralized however he started to pull it back the fish jew is absolutely delicious i'm so impressed by antonio's attitude because he seems to bounce back immediately which is a really good sign so he's down and he's definitely not out el ghetto negro that main course is something quite interesting about that he's got the sweaty potatoes mixed with the spinach this really nice delicious potato and rosemary soup topped off with this wonderful sea bass that's got these really nice acidic raisins bizarre combination but i think it really works what's next step after this last next four we've got four go now after that yeah yes and we're halfway there yeah wait and trust me this is not a racer every single play counts yeah make the next half as good as the first half yeah excellent thank you now goose barnacles taste absolutely fantastic but incredibly difficult to get your hands on i'm in golithia on the northwest coast of spain on hunt for one of the rain's most sought after delicacies pepper bears or goose barnacles they're delicious expensive everything a gourmet ingredient should be but they're also at the bottom of a 300 foot cliff my god the fast flowing water of the atlantic makes the goose barnacles stronger fatter and tasty to eat but absailing into it is the only way to reach them my god this is insane the powerful currents of the atlantic are not something to mess with [ __ ] i must be off my [ __ ] rocker [Music] once the waves retreat i've got just 30 seconds before they return to spot the goose barnacles and wrench them off the rocks my guide tells me that if i hear a whistle it means that the sea is coming crashing back in and i have to get out the way fast [Music] the waves are knocking me all over the place i can see the goose barnacles but i keep on being pushed in the wrong direction finally i've got my footing [Music] you got to be quick but i'm concentrating so hard on the prize i forget the first simple rule [Music] listen for the whistle i've lost the [ __ ] stick [ __ ] yes thank you [Music] you need a license to collect goose barnacles like this but i was quickly starting to think who'd want one given the risks oh [ __ ] breaking them off the rock turns out to be the easy part i've only collected a few handfuls when disaster strikes everything i collected was lost to the sea bag's gone this is by far the most dangerous fishing trip i've ever been on and i only managed a couple of handfuls before the tide filled the cove that was hard work i mean seriously hard work you're holding on and then when the wave wipes you out you're trying to focus on the grip but everything's just so slippy down there from 100 foot up as well looks nothing down there two and a half three meters high when it comes in it comes in big time well bloody hard [Music] great job yes a great joint job look at them they're beautiful what does that mean when they're just slightly red the quality is the best the quality is the best i'm going to show you how to do the perfect pacifier tapas style yeah excellent right the ultimate tapas petha vest now traditionally cooked in sea water so no salt in there whatsoever first i'm going to boil them in the sea water with bay leaves and a little bit of olive oil cook them for one minute they stay here in spain as long as it takes you to say the lord's prayer once they're cooked i need to remove their tough skins right the secret is to peel them when they're warm to finish them a sherry sauce with shallots bay leaves and a touch of fresh pepper definitely no salt this is going to be really quick a touch of sherry [Music] nice couple of tablespoons of cream bring that up to the boil add the rind and the juice of one lemon and just squeeze push it in there and then a couple of tablespoons of the cooking liquor that lets down the cream and the secret here is to keep a really nice delicate balance lemon out and pepper bears in now literally in the cream for 30 seconds and finished with fresh parsley really important to go on that cream for literally 30 seconds any longer than that it'll be like having a mouth full of elastic bands excellent right gentlemen path of this slightly different all right it is incredible the taste they are actually loving it are they fishing tomorrow yeah if they find my bag yeah i want my 300 [ __ ] euros back yeah okay yeah [Laughter] [Music] good hold on i guess some water guys well done tonight it's up to the diners if they don't like it they don't pay the fish was cooked to perfection the olive oil and the wilted spinach all tasted great and it looks superb i thought that the sultanas or raisins they were cooked in i think vinegar either white wine vinegar or something like that and that was really overpowering the fish stew was absolutely amazing a little bit on the salty side um but but really really nice and the fish was cooked perfectly the fish stew was was very well balanced very well seasoned um there was a very nice taste of saffron without being overpowering and the fish was very well cooked right elgato negros sea bass in terms of flavor sea bass tastes nice um don't really get the potato on potato the soup with the set of potatoes that doesn't quite make sense however what does lift the dish is there's wonderful raisins and pine nuts on the top of the sea bass this is a classic fish stew nothing glamorous just great bold flavors that's lovely perfectly seasoned fish tube he's gone really ultra modern on the starter but for the main course he's pulled it back a bit two really good dishes it'll be interesting to see what the diners prefer it was down to my

cinnamon coat chocolate [Music] [Applause] churros with hot chocolate done both brigades are making my spanish dessert recipe simon something you've put on your menu i haven't done them as yet but we'd love to do them very nice the scores are close everything rests on this last course guys make this count yes there's only four points different in this let's go if elgato negra take the title tonight it will propel this tiny place into the big time i don't want to go all that way to you know do a half half a job so we we've got our sights set on winning it and victory for lola rocco will mean a local london restaurant becomes a star in the capital to win the competition would be exciting that achievement is amazing so gentlemen i'm telling you simon these last dishes here okay are going to determine who's first new second yeah every plate make sure you're exactly over it yeah you're only four points behind yeah come on churros are a classic spanish street food but i think they make a great dessert they're deceptively tricky to make but well worth the effort now why are your churros bigger than simon's why yeah because we need four points more good service please tell us sixteen not too many there antonio and tony needs to be careful too many in the fryer and they won't cook properly four more way this is the last table yes okay last two portions matt okay keep it going excellent right churros elgatonegro can they beat the spaniards at their own classic dessert a lot smaller cooked in the center sauce they're good right wow that's surprising a little bit too big but more importantly that is raw that tip there's just cooked taste wise fantastic chocolate sauce brilliant however i'm absolutely devastated of the rawness and for me the big question across these desserts is why don't they cook one and taste it the chocolate sauce was lovely and gooey and really really nice and the donuts were lovely as well really lots of cinnamon on them so they're really delicious fantastic absolutely delicious the crispiness on the outside softer so just dip it in the chocolate fantastic i liked the cinnamon flavor on the churros however the dough was sticky inside i don't know whether that was because it was undercooked or whatever but it was a bit sticky inside the chocolate was fine but for me the tourist uh was undercooked so the results are in and it's time to find out who's our winner tonight uh simon how old do you think you did uh not as confident as a main course if i'm honest no antonio uh you grew up with them out of 25 customers how well do you think you did 15 15 16. okay let's find out how you did uh jb thank you right let's start off with la voca now for dessert the number of customers happy to pay out of 25 is blimey 14 out of 25. 11 customers didn't pay why not one main reason undercooked did you taste the first one second one white tears so elgato negro that means if you get more than 10 then you are the f word's best local spanish restaurant okay the number of customers that are happy to pay for your dessert out of 25. [Music] it's 23 out of 20. [Applause] welcome now do yourselves a big favor get out there and get a glass of fino well done sell the gold well done yes congratulations welcome really well congratulations yes well done are straight into fourth place on the f word leader board but will their score earn them a place in the semi-final you

For breakfast, there are Smoked haddock & spinach baked eggs. Lunch is a delicious Roasted tomato soup and for dinner, there's...",2022-11-28 22:16:02.926159, [Music] smoked haddock one of my favorite fish delicious highly sustainable packed with protein lightly smoked there's not a dye smoke there's a big difference so you haven't got that bright yellow tinge so much better next baby spinach there's a spinach that's very young full of zinc great flavor little teaspoon volleyball knob of butter that little touch of oil stops the butter from burning it looks like a lot of spinach but it's going to disintegrate almost by two-thirds i'm cooking spinach in butter open up the top of my pepper mill so the pepper becomes almost like sort of cracked pepper lots of fine once your spinach has reduced down by two-thirds add in your cubes of smoked haddock tarragon it's got that nice vinegary flavor quite tart pick off the little buds from the stalks keep hold of these and grateful when you're making italian vinegar red wine vinegar tarragon stalks in chop the tarragon into your creme fraiche little season now grain mustard goes brilliantly well with havoc incredible this mustardy herbie creme fresh will work equally well partnered with grilled chicken the haddock's starting to flake because it's smoked lightly cured it cooks so quickly your creme it's fraiche now it's almost like the beginning of the perfect fish pie but as opposed to putting pastry on top the eggs are going to bake on top so you've got this wonderful egg crust turn the gas off now crack your eggs around the outside just a little twist of pepper get the remainder of your cream fresh and put a little dollop in between that adds richness to the egg whites into the oven at 180 for 10 to 12 minutes [Music] whilst the haddock and eggs bake together i can knock up a simple spring onion garnish in professional kitchen chefs refuse to use the top of the spring onions but i love that nice dark green flavor it's less harsh than the white the smell of baked mustard you can't beat [Music] that is beautiful spinach has almost melted in with a hat up now just sprinkle your spring onions that gives that really nice sharpness wow my ultimate hearty breakfast smoked haddock and spinach baked eggs so packed with protein and iron you'll be raring to dive into the day ahead [Music] roasted tomato soup beautiful vine tomatoes the riper the tomatoes the better the soup take the core out get your thumb and place it half a centimetre underneath the tip of your knife place it in and then just twist around that's the only part of the tomato that we're not using red onion and garlic red onion because it's sweeter than a white onion slice your onions and your garlic nice and fine traditionally be making it in a pot it's so much better to start it off on top of the stove the searing the tomatoes and the garlic when it goes in the oven you actually roast the tomatoes and they don't stew there's a big difference in flavor be quite generous with the olive oil it makes the soup nice and glossy shiny salt pepper and then a little teaspoon of cayenne just gives it that heat but it's not as fierce as chilli take your tomatoes and just slice them in half and then a little touch of sugar that's gonna help intensify the sweetness a little sprinkle of aged bottled vinegar gives that nice dark rich acidity to the soup into the oven 20 25 minutes 180. to make my soup even more irresistible i'm going to make a punchy sun-dried tomato pesto to drizzle over the top now i'm making this in a pestle and mortar because you feel so much more in control and you're not depending on a blade that's whizzing around at a thousand miles an hour next in a dry pan toast off some pine nuts toast them the absolute max and then in the smell in there is incredible parmesan lightly grate that this is where it starts to become creamy extra virgin olive oil doesn't need salt because the parmesan is going to season it for you and just take a couple of tablespoons of the oil the sun-dried tomatoes are in really helps to make that stunning pesto i can smell those roasted tomatoes want them out wow next pour in a little vegetable stock or chicken stock so it sits halfway up the tomatoes put your spoon through those tomatoes they break up instantly bring that up to the boil let it simmer for three or four minutes i want to make it a little bit more creamy now cream in give that a little stir you can keep it rustic and you get your masher in and you've got that nice thick rich chunky tomato soup or get yourself a stick blender blitzing it like that you delays the bottom of the pan and you get all those amazing flavors from the bottom that's delicious to make my lunch extra hearty i'm going to knock up a deliciously gutsy version of cheese on toast to go with my tomato soup boss rabbit an absolute classic i'm gonna make a roux 50 grams of butter three nice tablespoons of flour and that's all aru is basically traditionally you would use flour butter and milk but in welsh rabbit the milk is often cheekily substituted for a stiff slug of stout gives it that strong gutsy flavor i want it nice and thick make sure those lumps are out a nice teaspoon of dijon mustard and then season it nice and spicy moisture sauce gives it that delicious intriguing flavor now that smells amazing almost brings tears to your eyes beautiful now boss rabbit wouldn't be a stunning welsh rabbit without rich mature cheese soap and a great montgomery cheddar goes well with a beer and drop that in really important to put this in while the roux is still nice and hot because the cheese melts now for the bread i prefer a good rustic country loaf that will stand up to my hardcore topping i want that nice crisp base to my welsh rabbit so toast it both sides [Music] spread that beautiful cheesy berry spicy mixture just great got a blister and bubble congratonate god a little splash alien perry and back under the krill for 90 seconds in one delicious creamy roasted tomato soup it's coming back to me all those days i had off school i used to purposely lie about feeling ill just to get a bowl of my mother's tomato soup how bad was that but my god it was worth it oh now my welsh rabbit [Music] look at those babies that just takes cheese on toast to another level wow roasted creamy tomato soup with a sun-dried tomato pesto served with the most amazing

eat good food whenever you want really important put the water on first so you can just have it gently simmering away ready for the pasta while the water comes to the boil start the sauce by slicing mushrooms first off fingers one in front two behind up and down then add olive oil to a hot frying pan [Music] i want that nice color on the mushrooms off the heat literally 10 seconds and when you toss something really important you get all the ingredients at the end of the pan push down and pull back that noise that that's all the water coming out of the mushrooms next finely chop a fat clove of garlic [Music] then prepare your leeks just take your knife and go down through the center turn it over and again into quarters so you've got all that opening up and then just rinse the top of that to get rid of any potential dirt or sand it just breaks up into nice little quarters add all that leek into those mushrooms beautiful and now the secret is to get rid of that water inside the leek as it cooks down all the water's gone you just left that really nice intense flavor garlic's got nice and crispy now we're going to add a touch of chicken stock in there beautiful lasagna sheets just going to drop the sheets in to the water lasagna sheets are an unusual choice for a dish like this but they work brilliantly although any type of pasta you've got in the cupboard will do and just twist that pan that stops any pasta actually sticking to the bottom of the pan chicken start to reduce down by half and it's almost delays the bottom of the pan basically washed all that wonderful flavor off turn the gas down and add a couple of tablespoons of cream this just enriches the dish bring it back up to the bowl and let it simmer for three to four minutes now the secret with the pasta is just taking it out a little early so you've got that nice texture hold up the sheet and just nip it and you can feel your fingers in the center it's ready turn the sauce down and lay these beautiful sheets of lasagna into that sauce i'm just gonna turn the gas off now and let the pasta sit in there and absorb that amazing sauce finish with chopped fresh tarragon it's a delicious herb it goes brilliantly well mushrooms and leeks just let that sit and almost sort of infuse to serve i'm making a quick bruschetta by toasting fresh chipata bread two nice slices drizzle that in olive oil a little bit of garlic just rub the bread the crust as well crust is what really takes that garlic now pan for the bread a little touch of olive oil as it starts to smoke bread in [Music] but look at

and takes minutes to make sweet corn fritters and yogurt dip it's brilliant to have a number of great recipes up your sleeve to rely on and let's be honest we've all got a tin of sweetcorn somewhere so i'm going to show you how to make the most amazing fritter first off the mixture take your flour sieve really important to sieve the flour that stops the mixture from having any lumps in there just before you get to the end i want to put half a teaspoon of baking powder the baking powder gives the mixture some lift in and just sieve that through a touch of salt and pepper next an egg about four tablespoons of milk and give that a little whisk now just put a little drizzle of olive oil in there that helps to relax the mixture whisk that in make sure we got rid of all those lumps so that i want a nice smooth almost like a cake mixture okay next take the seeds out of a chili to lower the heat roll the chilli so give it a really good shake [Music] tap them out slice in half into quarter and each quarter in half and chop through it's a really nice quick way of slicing a chili into the mixture spring onion take off that outside layer of the spring onion top and tail slice it in an angle it's a little bit of texture running through the mixture i want that nice crunch in coriander just slice through nice and gently and get that in there next to the sweetcorn now drain it from the tin and just pat it dry so it doesn't make the mixture too wet give that a nice mix you can see now i've got two thirds ingredients and one third of the mixture to bind together that's the secret of a good freighter so you're you're biting into excitement and not sort of dough pan on olive oil in nice and hot get a nice big dessert spoon you know there's one nice portion in space the fritters evenly around the pan in a clockwise direction so you always know which one to turn first just with the back of your spoon sort of spread them out a little bit okay palette knife just check and happy with the color and turn over beautiful now for the chili yogurt dressing deseed and finely chop a red chilli and add to a pot of natural yogurt and then some fresh lime [Music] finish with chopped coriander coriander in and give that a nice mix up that chilli just lifts it the lime gives it that nice tanginess the fritters they smell amazing and with the sauce tastes fantastic that is such a delicious recipe using a tin of sweet corn from your cupboard amazing beef tacos with wasabi mayo the great thing about street food is anything goes the only rule is they've got to be really fast and really tasty now these tacos mix a mexican and japanese flavors into a delicious meaty mouthful first off get that pan really nice and hot these are sirloin steaks sear it in the pan with all that fat on i'll add flavor salt and pepper couple tablespoons of olive oil in pan nice and hot hold up the steak and lay it in always lay away give the pan a little shake and it stops the steak from sticking we're looking for color and if it sticks it's gonna burn [Music] while the steaks are cooking i can get on with my super quick marinade now two tablespoons of misood paste that's a fermented soybean that gives a really nice sort of rich sweetness tablespoon of sugar a couple of tablespoons rice wine that gives it a really nice vinegary kick a couple of tablespoons of olive oil salt and pepper i'm looking for a nice sort of thick rich marinade marinade done it's time to turn the steaks sort the pan and to give the steaks a little base all we're doing every time is just adding more and more flavor take your tongs and sort of lift the steak on its back and really melt all that fat down off of the gas take them out just take your knife see all that fat there just slice that off i don't want any of that now in to the marinade [Music] beautiful tacos are one of mexico's most popular street foods they've been made from beef pork chicken or fish and are loaded up with amazing sauces and spices now i want something sort of pickly cabbage these are chinese cabbages slice it in half and look at it really crisp and really tasty we're going to slice that into quarters and then just shred it and take your time you think of cabbage here and you think of sort of braised overcooked cabbage nothing worse but at a taco you want freshness a little season chili flakes they sort of discreetly give it a little bit of heat a little touch of rice wine vinegar if you haven't got that fresh lemon juice a small drop of toasted sesame seed oil give that a really good mix now i need something to sort of bring it together we take some wasabi paste very hot very spicy a sort of thumbnail size i'm gonna mix that with a couple of tablespoons of mayonnaise and give that a really good mix these are basic corn tortilla the trick is to sort of color them and then shape them actually place it on the gas ring use some tongs so as not to burn yourself you can also toast your tacos in a frying pan from there i'm just gonna place it on the rolling pin literally 30 seconds as it cools down the great thing about serving tacos is people can fill them themselves just the way they want them cabbage just squeeze out wet marinade a nice rustic little mountain mayonnaise on wait you see how soft and delicious and almost sort of melting in the mouth texture we've got on this amazing sirloin look at that really nice sear around the outside it's just nice and pink in the middle start off with my crispy shell back of the spoon with the wasabi mayonnaise inside taco and just sprinkle that delicious pickled cabbage and then just start lining my taco three or four slices touch more on my spicy layer and that is how i'd make the perfect taco [Music] my flavor packed lamb with fried bread whether i'm cooking high-end dishes or rustic dishes trust me it all has to be impressive so this lamb dish proves that you don't have to spend a fortune to create delicious food first off put the pan on this is a lamb steak and it's cut just above the leg just here cause you can see that delicious bone running through the center and that's full of marrow so that just gives the lamb a nice added sweet flavor just take your knife cut through each end this stops the lamb steak from buckling so therefore it cooks evenly and colors beautifully salt and pepper lamb needs quite a lot of help with the pepper so be quite generous with the pepper and just pat that down the pan's just under smoke on the outside now put the oil in get that pan really nice and hot because this is a cheap cut so i'm depending on the color of the lamb steak to really sort of impart a lot of flavor that's the noise you want to hear you can't hear that noise don't drop a steak in put a little bit of garlic in there not chopped garlic just whole cloves the garlic lightly crushed don't even waste time peeling them in tongs lift up that bit of fat around the back that's the top of the leg tilt the pan and let all that fat render rendering is a chef's term that means melting the fat it works brilliantly when you're cooking a rib eye as well turn it over that color there beautiful now it looks like an expensive cut and we've got that nice even sear all over as it's cooking just tilt the pan and base and basting the lamb steak just means you're sort of adding all that nice scented garlic olive oil back into the lamb useful now take the lamb out and let the lamb rest [Music] now for the perfect rustic crouton so this bread's quite firm a couple of days old just slice it straight down the center dice it up put it into a bowl season it beautifully [Music] from there i'm gonna add some milk sounds strange adding milk to crouton but it just gives it that nice rich creamy texture and just let that milk sort of absorb into the bread while that's soaking i'm gonna make the dressing go back to that initial garlic that was in the pan look at that beautiful into the pest and water anchovies anchovies go brilliantly well with lamb i want that nice salty vinegary flavor and a bit of kick some capers the little baby cats very sweet now just pound that to a nice paste that smells incredible next some dijon mustard a nice teaspoon and a half in a little bit of red wine vinegar two tablespoons and then our extra virgin olive oil now it's got that heat in there i've got a nice roasted garlic they're all hearty chunky vinaigrette that sort of seeps into that lamb some fresh parsley crunch up the parsley delicious flavour parsley in nice now get your pan hot for the croutons olive oil in the pan grab the croutons and squeeze all that excess milk out not too hard i don't want them dry and in and then just fry them and the milk inside these croutons give it a nice spongy creamy delicious flavor that's the color i want nice now take them out and lightly drain them a little bit of kitchen roll onto the board out [Music] it's a plateman just take it's amazing vinaigrette and spread it get those croutons listen to them like little boulders hitting the play the lamb sit that on next one on the rest of the croutons on now use all those little bits and my chef in paris would kill me right now if you saw me using those because they're the ugly scraps that customers should never see but but they're the best bits croutons on and then just drop that sauce on all those little bits of the lamb and there that is a perfect way of taking a cheap cut is the premier league of dishes

extraordinary thai restaurants will the f-word diners prefer patria's obsessive attention to detail or will it be seduced by the sophistication of mighty yum yum who will be crowned the f words queen of thai cuisine next on the menu as the thai teams go head to head in the kitchen have i finally met my match too what did you just say he's hungry she's angry watch out don't make her angry otherwise we're all screwed we're back in london at the f word restaurants tonight a cuisine that has exploded in popularity in the uk thai with this irresistible combination of fresh flavors exquisite presentation and healthy ingredients it's no wonder that thai food has become a hit with the nation's food lovers and thanks to your nominations and months of searching we found the f word's best two local thai restaurants yum yum in north london and simply thai in teddington [Music] 25 portions of each is not a race chef right on order focused everyone yum yum two prawn fish cakes thank you moy simply time six cod fish cake yeah yeah chef thank you though you scared me then hidden away in the london suburb of teddington there's a tide restaurant so authentic it wouldn't be out of place in amongst the back streets of bangkok [Music] the russian success is a testament to the die-hard dedication of 57 year old kitchen dynamo petraea i've always got very high ambition i want to get the top of everything i do simply time may only have 10 tables but every single dish is cooked or finished by petraeus don't do anything you understand temperament and obsessive quality control are remarkable i never never take a shortcut doesn't matter how busy the restaurant if things go smoothly i get bored for simply thai's fish cakes petrol uses only the finest freshest cod fillet they're served with adjoined a traditional thai cucumber salad what's in here what's in here um is cucumber shallots chili and this syrup it is sugar vinegar and why does sweet salt work so well in thai cooking what's the secret behind that the thai knows how to use the sugar because english cooking don't know how to use they don't you don't have sugar in your in your roast beef and your chipotle definitely not no yeah do you think these are better than moyes or mois is better yes of course mine could be the best right moy yep where did the recipe come from from your mum yeah how long have you been on the menu for 17 years ready and how many portions of the week do you sell we were five five hundred pieces very popular amazing moya and her husband has spent 17 years building up their glamorous north london restaurant a restaurant of this nature needs people who appreciate the quality of what we create yum yum has had to open up a series of new dining areas to make more room for the ever-growing number of customers i feel like i'm in thailand it's the most probably the easiest way i can explain it yum yum has 36 staff and can handle up to 500 covers a night the success of this restaurant is built on fantastic service and a delicious dining experience which keeps their customers coming back again and again they will ask me are you expanding the restaurant i say no i want only one tyrant stone to the best that is it that i want moy makes her fish cakes using grey featherback a fish that's highly prized in thailand and will give moy's dish a truly authentic thai flavor would you ever cook these fish cakes in a pan as opposed to fine they're always deep-fried always deep-fried always do you to try in the oven right quite nice quite nice but too dry to dry yes we've last stable two make these two as exciting as the first two yep yep coming soon everybody come in go go go chef two seconds complete the table first and i'll send them all just in case yeah you know why the food is too hot you already said i don't want my food get cold yeah i'm going now you happy with them yes nice okay table six please let's go my simply ty i've only got 30 covers in the dining room so this should be a walk in the park for you to beat simply tight tonight yeah i'll be able to share myself service please temple 14. right some people say that food is a new religion they may have a point britain is home to almost 30 000 thai people and in the heart of south west london is europe's only purpose-built thai temple where i'll be serving up a very special meal i love thai food i love cooking it and i love eating it but this has to be the most daunting task so far this small and revered group of buddhist monks live in the monastery attached to the temple they spend most of their waking hours meditating and studying buddha's teachings forbid them to cook so it's up to the local thai community to offer the one meal the monks are allowed to eat at 11 o'clock each day helping me fulfill this honor and privilege is chang executive chef of the blue elephant one of london's top thai restaurants good morning good morning how are you good morning how are you good to see you thank you for coming to the blue elephant a little bit tight in here where have we gone chan morning everybody uh oh yeah yeah yeah pressure's on right yeah so they're gonna be before 11 o'clock yeah are they fussy eaters no they are really nice they're really kind they ever send food back no never [Music] the restaurant prepares the very best dishes to offer to the monastery and every dish has to be perfect like these savory dumplings known as money bags so that's a money bag and that's it yeah sauce easy and simple maybe you can try these dumplings are usually served as a starter pork and crab meat are wrapped in a delicate bean curd pastry and the tops are tied with thin strips of spring onion now the shoe laces now it's uh the next step nice and tight very tight and how do you call the money bag in your language chang's authentic money bags are delicious but i want to show my take on a classic thailand's national dish pad thai okay a quick pad thai i fry shallots garlic and chilli with salt and a little bit of sugar color on the shallots half the spring onions this is a dish i love cooking at home i'm using delicious king prawns and adding some extras like chili and tamarind paste i'm so excited to be cooking for the monks today yes never cooked for months before you know those prawns smell amazing my pad thyme is made sweet and sour with fish sauce salt and sugar turn up the gas and the tamarind place a beaten egg is cooked in the wok and then added with the noodles and bean sprouts to the sauce i hope they're going to be happy with this you know that i think the monk will be happy prawns and fresh coriander finish the pad thai but what will chan think of my quick and easy version of this classic and then some peanuts around the outside happy oh no but i had to test yeah please oh you don't call pat i have to take it first what do you want to know from me ask me how is it oh no look at that face this is not pad thai at all this is not pancake no but i have to be sweet sour and salty i think that doesn't taste too bad it's not perfect for you but not for me you're a tough cookie i want to keep an eye on the monks it goes down traditionally chang isn't impressed but more crucially what will the monks think the food being offered today is brought to the monastery to serve to the monks bang on 11 o'clock good morning tam is a regular worshiper at the temple where respect and etiquette are crucial yeah of course my path is separated into dishes and joins the small portions of everyone's food every day all this food comes in right donated in this wonderful palace so this is one tree each tray is for each monk for each monk look at all that food mr chang doesn't like my pad thai it doesn't taste very good apparently i guess i can see from the canalis look nice yeah exactly the monks pray and chant before eating this is a far cry from a service that clara juice now it's my turn but it's hard to tell what they make of it because if you offer food you're forbidden to talk to the monks whilst they're eating i knew it was going to be you know respectful and you know brilliantly done but it's very serious very serious it's always like this always well always to find out how well the pad thai went down i spy on the monks to see if they're enjoying it how can you say my bad dies yet look come on for me but maybe the man like that tastes but they don't like it look at that it's the most eaten bowl my pad thai seemed to go down well but i couldn't resist breaking the protocol by asking the monks about the food one very simple question did you enjoy the pad thai yes [Laughter] this experience takes respect for food to a completely different level it's humbling and a fascinating insight into thai buddhist tradition that was an amazing experience and it was so nice to see such traditional thai culture here in the middle of wimbledon as for being a monk and eating my last meal at 11 o'clock in the morning nah thanks but no thanks [Music] right last table yeah moy table two please yes thank you good well done that's it very good fish cakes were amazing uh the sauce like a sweet sausage sauce and complimented it really well the fish cakes were a little bit rubbery but the flavors that and the ingredients that went into them were really good welcome therefore really good to see you thank you how are you absolutely yeah nervous yeah yeah how do you think your dear lady is doing in there you know she is the kind of person that would would hit it while at the spot i'm very confident that so you can handle pressure brilliantly absolutely and what it means for you to leave here this evening as your victory you know for our area stoke newington it's very important for us i love the presentation all laid out beautifully beautiful little dressing not your usual sweet chili sauce dumped on the edge of the plate it was too much spice in the cod cakes and in the end i didn't wasn't able to recognise what else was in there welcome to the work really nice to see you oh thank you you worked with pottery a lot yes yes does she share in front of the customers sometimes she just get out from the restaurant this is my restaurant if the some customer a bit rude or complained to her yeah and she throws them out yeah now what would it mean for her tonight to leave the f-word restaurant as a winner she hopes a lot she will get the the winner i think now yum yums are made with a great feather back from prawns basically a thai freshwater fish mmm it's rather spongy feel that little texture of a sort of sponge when you press it with a fork and simply tie again quite an interesting dressing love the color texture-wise that's delicious it's less spongy and sort of more robust both very delicious give me a tough one to call if it was me i'd have to go for a simply thai while the rest of the diners enjoy yum yum and simply thai's fish cakes here's my take on this classic thai dish clay fish cakes fragrant delicate and packed full of flavour first off start prepping the fish fillets of coli prawns red curry paste sugar fish sauce salt [Music] eggs kaffir lime leaf coriander lid on pulse french beans shape just flatten it down a little bit chill cucumber relish chopped cucumber shallot chili lime dressing coriander and mint hot pan vegetable fried they smell delicious drain [Applause] [Music] thai fish cakes with cucumber relish done so all the diners have finished their starters and the results are in now they are tough customers out there how well do you think you did i'm happy very very happy out of 25 customers how many do you think are happy to pay for that oh all wow i love that huh moy yeah how many do you think out of 25 and have a different five hours 25 out of 25. what's with the conflicts between you guys it's amazing okay let's find out the results jb thank you let's start off with simply thai yeah the amount of customers they're happy to pay for your delicious fish cakes out of 25 is 21 out of 25 that's amazing that is amazing that's very good huh what did they like the four guests slightly overcooked slightly overcooked yeah really yeah couldn't taste as well the fish okay don't show those four customers to patro she'll kick them out okay very good start are you happy thank you yeah are you happy very happy good i'm glad you're happy so you should be no moy your heart is pounding okay let's see the number of customers out of 25 willing to pay for yum yum's fish cakes is 22 out of 25 well done well done that is incredible really well done 22 out of 25. both fantastic scores yum yum you're now one point in the lead clear down and get ready for the main courses they could all change yes on this main course well done now 50 portions each you can do this good luck there's only one point in it yes yes okay let's go right simply time for pork curry let's go thank you yum yum for chicken curry no one's answering me anna's six thank you ladies okay now both thresholds are cooking the main course first up is simply thai petraeus is an incredible driving force behind simply thai and teddington absolutely love her food i've been coming since i was 10 i think lots of the people here are very faithful regulars patria's amazing work ethic is matched only by her passion for the food she serves every dishes on the menu is my favorite one sweet spicy pork please simply thai signature dish tonight is spicy sweet pork to make a paste petraea finely cuts lemongrass chops galangal similar to ginger but it's much more subtle peels and slices the skin of a thai lime garlic coriander root and thai shallots the smell the aroma is much stronger than the continental shallots next she adds red chili black pepper and crispy pork fat and grinds to a fine paste in a petal and water i learned to make this recipe with my arms this is what very little must be about 13 or 14 years old i had to sit on the floor and my hand that time was so small and this is big and it's really a hard work for a little girl she fries the pork loin and puts aside in a saucepan she fries off the paste adds coconut cream and the fried pork loin next she adds steamed pork belly palm sugar white sugar some fish sauce and chopped fine green beans she serves a deep-fried salty duck egg and a salad with sweet thai dressing service please spicy sweet pork served [Music] now tell me about the recipe what you've got about it it's quite a complex very very very complex and hard working it took me six hours last night just to make the curry paste because we have to use pesto and mortar well i got a neighbor came round and look at the door maybe not yeah knock at the door what are you doing why are you banging i've never heard it before you dancing something was it in the middle of the night no 10 o'clock 10 o'clock in the evening in the evening did you throw them out yes it did yeah good now moy yep you're one point in the lead are you feeling confident yeah chef head chef moy has been serving up a flavor of thailand to yum yum in north london for almost 20 years i've been to thailand quite a few times and it's most probably the nearest i would get to it absolutely fantastic from starters right through to dessert absolutely amazing food has always been a huge part of moy's life and she was trained to cook the traditional thai way in in thailand yeah thai girl in a family must go to the kitchen and learn how to cook yum yum signature dish tonight is red chicken curry with plantain moist starts by peeling and slicing green plantain [Music] she peels a green papaya and slices it in thailand we have this in our backyard so we grew up with this and easy to get and you don't have to buy it next for the red curry paste she cuts lemongrass finely chops galangal the rind of a thai lime a coriander stem and crushes garlic oh it's going away then she adds to seeded red chilies and blends [Music] she fry the red curry paste in a hot wok for 10 minutes she adds coconut cream fish sauce sugar chopped chicken the plantain and papaya she then cooks it for five minutes finally moyad's red and green chilies and thai sweet basil [Music] red chicken curry with plantain served [Music] now moy you're currently in the lead yeah what do it mean for you to win tonight we're happy very happy what would you do for the restaurant party party party and what other thai should you think you're good in london i don't know wow wow wow wow what makes yours stand apart i'm quite confident that my food is good right patra you ever been to nam the mission star thai restaurant several times do you enjoy it yes i did fantastic food yeah and more have you ever been to naam no i haven't been there no never heard of it i've heard of it yes do you think you'll be the second child to get a mission of style yes it will be soon soon soon i like that confidence pattern yes chef what does your husband think about your food i haven't got one and i don't need one no i'm capable of looking after myself i'm sure you are but would you like me to introduce you to a nice young french voice no thank you no no thank you okay no sorry jb patrick said no she wants someone a little bit younger you're too big honestly she's getting out what's the matter what did you just say she's angry yeah watch out don't make her angry otherwise we're all screwed are you demanding with men as much as you are in your kitchen no compromise no compromise yep savage please patriarchy seriously when was your last day off uh last sunday last easter sunday yes oh my god so you don't take sunday monday off with your days off no i can't afford it you're amazing you are an iron lady i'm determined well done bloody good job thank you spicy sweet that's a good lie i like that the chicken was very well cooked it was well presented because the rice was out of the bowl which was a lot more easy to consume as well it had the classic kind of thai taste to it but the only thing that really didn't work for me was the plantain it was a little bit hard a little bit bland the port was cooked very well it's very tender nicely thinly sliced the actual curry itself was quite greasy and a lot of the meat it was quite fatty and i found the rice to be a bit cold so i was a bit unhappy with this course right simply ties pork curry very authentic put caulk twice slow roasted and then a loin of pork sauteed finished mmm flavor's amazing texture delicious not too hot but a real nice depth of flavor this is a very authentic pork curry absolutely phenomenal yum yums that's the kind of color you're expecting a chicken curry there's such a difference a huge contrast simply thai tastes and looks authentic yum yum comes across mainstream and not that exciting i would imagine that the diners would prefer the authenticity of simply thai with only one point between the teams it couldn't be tighter okay let's find out the results uh john baptist please okay let's go simply tie first yeah so bearing in mind but they are a tough tough bunch of diners this evening the number of customers are happy to pay out of 50 is wow 39 out of 50. well done huh that's really good pretty good indeed that's a great score 39 uh jb feedback they found the little bit too fatty they found the meat a little bit too fatty would you like to throw out the 11 people they're not going to pay for it um no no no okay because they're still good they have to still decide exactly what well done 39.50 pretty good okay yum yum the number of diners that are happy to pay for your chicken curry yeah is wow 23. that's a bit of a shock okay jv the main problem was too spicy two spices spicy they found a portion as well not balanced uh somewhere big somewhere smaller damn it's not over yet you can pull this back it has happened before yeah clear down let's go for the dessert right damn yeah there's a shop now time for the recipe challenge we've got everything here restaurants yes cameraman yes chef yes celebrities yes ingredients yes let's [ __ ] do it it's good to see you oh we don't need this now what are you cooking i'm going to do a trifle it is so simple to do because you know you're not i can see you know faffing around with eggs and yolks and vanilla pods and all that sort of stuff i mean literally just sponge fingers lemon curd and liqueur and you're off right so you're making trifle okay i'm making a trifle i'm making my version of a trifle now shouldn't be doing the custard first are you doing the sponge first uh no doing the sponge for uh actually that's a good point it's quicker probably if i did the cream first how does this work normally if you were doing it for six people yes you would need half a liter of double cream just over 100 grams 120 grams of caster sugar that is quite a lot of sugar trifles not exactly cutting edge is it something you remember from your childhood uh yeah well childhood with a scottish childhood like yours then when we were children i mean it was about getting as much cholesterol as you could in two kids until they died wasn't it it was massive it was meat pies it was haggis slice cream so roy's doing his version of his trifle i'm gonna do exactly the same this time i'm gonna use panettone first i'm gonna make a really nice delicious custard now this is the fun part this is the quantum you sprinkle a little bit over there if i was doing keith floyd a little bit over there and quite a lot in here [ __ ] me that's gonna kick right okay very very good that's all wonderful don't forget keith floyd very very sadly miss he was a man who invented all that thing that gordon is so good at which is of course swearing on television right okay uh how are we doing right where's the cream going round round round you see this is the thing your voice is hard to do because you've lost the scottish accent do you think it's that difficult to do yeah you can get a bit there's a little bit of birmingham in there but i don't i just you know i kind of listened to you and i've tried i've studied you i've done you in shows what works is the makeup yeah is that i mean it takes an hour and a half the scars an hour and a half it took how do you do that every morning yes your forehead looks like mine already come on i do i know we uh i'm going to put some lemon juice into this to make some lemon custard okay how old are you when you first started doing impressions uh about uh eight or nine i used to watch my yard a lot remember mike yard yeah and he was if he was the first person to do bob mann castle like all that he used to love me bob and david attenborough all of those and prince charles in front of your parents reggie yeah yeah yeah there's too many impressions of people alive uh get off yes sir we have david blanket chef with pie but he was always so aggressive david was uh don't don't pat the doggy love your [ __ ] head off no today i'll be launching daft legislation no sorry i'll read that again draft legislation how long does it take you you perfected blair bush well that took me about yeah 12 years i think george bush we miss you know he went it was the end of an error so now we have obama obama can you do it he's cool he's authoritative and um just want to say he speaks slowly if there is anyone out there who still doubts we haven't got time to do the whole thing we'd have never can you do an impression of obama come on you're so serious tonight i'm doing now the custard's thickened great a touch of the orange zest in there that makes it nice and light fragrant less rich the panettone slice nice and thinly not too thick and then cut the slices in half and spread with a little thick cut marmalade and then from there slice that down into cubes a little touch of ground manure on top so that really nice rich flavor running through and then from there can i watch you because my recipe means i've got loads of time from there thing is roy i'm gonna beat you this is not a race it's about perfection you know how competitive i am huh now right there you have the features set and then blind tasteful pick a winner

incredible way to transform meat into mouth-wateringly melting dishes mastering the art of slow cooking is something every cook should learn first up my phenomenal slow cooked beef short ribs slow cooking is a brilliant way of getting lots of extra depth and intensity into your dishes the secret is to lock in all those flavors at the start and let the ingredients do their thing as it cooks these are beef short ribs and there's basically five to six bones across there and as the short rib cooks it sticks to that bone the bone implants flavor and the meat just sort of melts cooks slowly gives it that nice level intensity slice alongside the bone straight down you can see that marbling that sort of disappears and disintegrates i'm cooking them in a roasting tray get it on the heat until nice and hot season these short ribs beautifully olive oil in bone on the top we'll start coloring that in [Music] it's really important to give the beef short rib a really nice sear if you didn't brown the meat off it goes in the oven and it looks like boiled meat so you really want that nice dark rich coloring just cut the garlic in half slide that down the side that's going to give that beef an amazing flavor [Music] to give body to the sauce stir in a heaped teaspoon of tomato puree i'm just hitting the bottom of the pan with that tomato puree and we call it cooking out but smell a puree otherwise it just goes in there raw and it gives this sort of tartness to the braised short ribs red wine in don't use an expensive bottle of red wine there's no need bring the wine up to the boil and reduce it this burns off the alcohol and concentrates the flavor it makes a big difference when you reduce the red wine down by half because it gives that nice dark rich intensity look at my garlic that is just gonna sweeten everything up incredible stock in beef stock perfect chicken stock fine just to about an inch underneath the beef short ribs bring it up to the ball to lock in all that flavor as the beef ribs slow cook cover them so they braise from the bottom and steam from the top into the oven two and a half hours 170 to 180 degrees in she goes the great thing about slow cooking is you do most of the work in advance and then put your feet up five or ten minutes before the beef short ribs come out of the oven start your garnish it's a light cured pancetta i want nice thick lardons nice big thick sticks of crispy bacon [Music] these are delicious chestnut mushrooms i'm not going to slice them i'm just going to cut them in half but look at the color on those lardons now all the whites raw fat have disappeared the lardons have shrunk right down and all we've got there now is the proper bacon mushrooms in beautiful so the mushrooms get seasoned from the bacon i'm pan frying these separately to the beef so they remain crisp and have a different texture [Music] leave that to cool down now this is like christmas day for me when you unwrap that fall wait you see what's underneath it [Music] wow they smell incredible lift and place on the tray beautiful to make a fantastic rich deep sauce press the soft roasted garlic through a sieve into the cooking juices all that nice pureed garlic coming through there because that is going to make the most amazing flavor scrape all of that off the sieve nice then just start sieving all that lovely braising liquor wow in that smells delicious take your sauce and just glaze do them individually they deserve that respect spoon on your bacon and your mushrooms [Music] useful be generous with these mushrooms i'm telling you they taste amazing flat leaf parsley all that freshness over those amazing ribs incredible never ever be embarrassed about going to your butcher and asking for cheap cuts because the results are incredible amazing beef braised short ribs with bacon and mushrooms delicious slow braised stuffed lamb breast one of the secrets to slow cooking is to be robust and really get stuck in big bold flavors work really well so don't be precious this is gutsy cooking at its absolute best these are lamb breasts a beautiful cheap cut and it's sort of tucked alongside the rib they've been boned out the skin has been taken off i'm going to roll them stuff them and braise them braising simply means cooking in liquid on a low heat making the meat divinely tender now open them up and give them a really good season season them both sides inside and out really important it doesn't look like a real weighty dense cut of meat but once it's beautifully slow braised it's just like melting lamb it's incredible i'm going to season the breast with some dried oregano put a heat in there some chili flakes [Music] lemon zest there's some amazing salted anchovies in there now they almost melt inside the lamb so the balance of flavors work beautifully now pull it down towards you and roll that nice and tightly that's what i'm looking for string i just need to tie them three times one at each end and one in the middle i fell in love with this dish years ago when i first started working in paris because we had all the lamb in from the pyrenees nice thing is they can be done the day before pan on olive oil in get that oil nice and hot lamb in really important to get some nice color on there whilst they're browning slice the onion the lamb's gonna be cooking for two and a half hours so don't slice the onions too thinly otherwise they'll burn garlic and leave whole got a color on them look at that beautiful take them out onions in and garlic straight in that's the secret about slow braising you never change pans why all the goodness is in that one pan a few chili seeds in there oregano nice pinch a little bit of lemon in there i'm gonna do the onions what i did to the lamb [Music] next my capers fry them off get them exploding the bottom of the pan they get nice and crispy next my black olives now white wine bring that up to the boil delays in the pan as well i rinse in the bottom of that pan and now the flavour in there is just extraordinary now where that tomatoes [Music] puncher those plum tomatoes [Music] then simply place the lamb breast back in the pot and remember to taste [Music] that's nice [Music] lid on into the oven 170 two two and a half hours and forget about it [Music] whoa beautiful all that has reduced down to this amazing nice tomato sauce and the lamb has kept its color look at that it's braised beautifully very carefully get your little bits there slice off pull off the little bits of string this is why i get really excited the secret is not to slice it too thinly look at that i can smell the lemon it's hard to believe when you slice through the center there that that is a very cheap cut of meat i'm salivating i love this i mean it's just incredible pick up the tomatoes and the olives and the onions an amazing rich sauce take your lamb sort of just sit it on it looks incredible and that for me is why chefs get so excited with cheap cuts because the end results are incredible delicious breast of lamb with lemon anchovies chili and oregano [Music] my next recipe turns what used to be a decidedly unfashionable cut of meat into the star of the dish fit to grace any table slow roasted pork belly with fennel [Music] slow roasting works better on fattier tougher and unfashionable cuts whether it's a cheek or even a neck or this amazing pork belly it's a fantastic way to transform cheap cuts into amazing melting perfection take a very sharp knife bring the pork belly towards you so you're over it and you've got all that pressure and weight using the tip of the knife i'm just sort of nicking it and go across the pork belly long strokes with a knife take your time turn it 180. this time what we're doing is just sort of cutting these nice little sort of diamonds but as that starts roasting on top it starts getting nice and crispy take your handfuls of salt and just sort of rub it in bend it over and in all those cracks really helps to get a nice crisp crackling on top roasting tray getting really nice and hot take a hole over fennel to intensify flavor and to keep the meat succulent i'm braising my pork belly with strong vibrant spices and vegetables crush and peel three whole cloves of garlic and add to the fennel olive oil in fennel in i like the nice strong aniseed flavor that goes with that nice rich dense pork fennel seeds delicious star anise in and just a couple of cardamom seeds and wow they're like little bangers like little firecrackers incredible lovely fresh bay leaves get your pork skin side down just sear the top of that fat that locks in all that amazing flavor then i'm going to flip it over and get it nice and crispy and then i want fennel seeds embedded in those little cracks now some white wine a minute that white wine hits that pan you can smell that light fragrance from the fennel allow the wine to bubble away and reduce until the alcohol has burnt off time that the stock now the stock goes in just underneath the skin so it roasts on top all that meat under there will be submerged because what happens in the oven the top goes crispy as anything and the stock reduces and braises at the same time really importantly bring that back up to the ball before it goes in the oven otherwise it will never boil never get up to temperature smells incredible slow roast the pork belly at 180 degrees for two and a half hours [Music] look at that you've got that nice crispy skin on top you can see how much of the stock has evaporated put that onto the board it looks stunning to make a delicious rustic sauce with the flavor packed contents of the roasting tray first get rid of the excess fat take a couple of slices of bread it's like a perfect sponge because you just lay that on top and drag it almost like a net and it just absorbs all that fat if you want the perfect fried bread trust me stick that in a frying pan a nice teaspoon of mustard whisk that in and then simply simmer for a few minutes before pouring into a serving jug with your pork belly always use a nice serrated edge knife you can hear that that is amazing incredibly tender that belly of pork is gonna almost melt in your mouth you've got that sweet meat under that crispy belly of pork what an amazing way to cook a very cheap cut of meat [Music] you

contenders here's how i found them i've loved french food for many years so i couldn't wait to start searching for the creme de la creme of french restaurants [Music] my team traveled all over britain to visit the places you nominated where you love to eat [Music] from stroud to cambridge from teddington to tunbridge wales from norwich to battersea presentation wise it's very basic as a native frenchman the f-word maitre d can certainly spot exceptional french cuisine it's not pretentious it's fairly small it's friendly you get well look after it's modern french so they're not stuck at their own backside after months of whittling daniel nominations we finally found two outstanding restaurants tucked away in serberton 13 miles from london is the gastronomic treat the french table [Music] runs his kitchen with french passion a good plate it's like a beautiful woman he needs to look good he needs to taste good and you mustn't be disappointed because that's it you don't love it

the house special pyrenean lamb god it's like butter incredible i wouldn't expect to find a lamb of that quality on a menu tucked away the backer beyond serbato in a bistro the lamb delicious [Music] what a fine for me the hard thing is that there's only two restaurants that are going through to cooking the f-word restaurant and this having been in love with french food for many years has been a very very tough choice and with only two restaurants going through the french table was one of them congratulations brilliant can't believe it really can't believe it and just think quite excited i'm

just the man to check it out is that great hi thanks how are you john baptiste grew up in restaurants and his uncle ran one of the most amazing restaurants in lyon so if there's one person that can spot an amazing bistro it's definitely john baptiste run by greg bureau the bouchon has only been open for two years but his reputation is spreading as the most genuine french restaurant for miles around people here are uh well traveled they visited france many many times and it feels like they are in france when they come to buchanan is the head chef he first fell in love with cooking as a boy

everything brings lots of memories really for you salad pizza lovely thank you i wish you a bit thank you very tasty very fresh the products are beautifully cooked you can ask for better than that the reason i have to cook is simply because you get a whole fish some raw vegetables and from all that you can create something that is really magical pretty much the veal perfectly cooked so tender you can really see that um the garlic and the stove nose nose is cooking nico is obviously a very talented individual but running a successful kitchen relies on teamwork and his geordie colleagues are very loyal is your team uh are they all french or no none of them are none of them are no so you're only a froggy in there yes i'm the one yeah we need to have a good relationship i'll teach him how to reply and jody he can teach me i would reply in french it's all good at the end of the day it's going to be a new language beforehand jb said bouchon bistro was faultlessly brilliant and in this

single plate they send out is crucial i've challenged them to cook one of my favorite ingredients foie gras a french classic that is the ultimate test for these restaurants while they prepare their own recipes here's how i do it foie gras has to be the chef's ultimate ingredient rich sumptuous melt in your mouth and absolutely delicious first off caramelise your apples core peel slice hot pan

if anyone refuses to pay for that prague here's my french food in the envy of the world i'm going back to my beloved paris to find out about one of the most famous french foods of all the croissants as we brits embrace coffee shop culture the croissant is fast becoming our favorite breakfast and last year we ate a staggering 60 million of them [Music] but the majority were mass produced by machines in factories and they can often contain additives for taste color and to make them last longer sadly the majority of questions we get in this country tastes like old cardboard so i'm off to paris to learn the art of a perfect croissant [Music] we may expect inferior question in the uk but even in paris the factory croissant is beginning to take over [Music] many french boulangeries are now buying in the same mass-produced dough and if you want to find a traditional authentic handmade croissant you've got to look a little harder [Music] as a young chef i spent a couple of years working my ass off in paris i was very fortunate to live above the most amazing boulangerie eating questions seven days a week what i never got chance to do was perfect the perfect question so i'm going back to the floor to see if i can turn out a batch of questions as a pro baker arno del montel has been hand making croissants for over 20 years [Music] he's a president who's still producing the delicious rare handmade versions we're all missing out on what's the secret behind your croissants um love butter yeah good ingredients yes and can you teach the perfect question or is it all in the field it depends of the student right i hope i don't disappoint him okay so whose recipe is this did you steal it from an english chef um not really the ingredients to make the dough are simple flour sugar milk salt and yeast but they're perfectly balanced and the smallest mistake will ruin the entire batch with water and eggs added the dough is then chilled and rested to use for the next day's baking okay it's 24 hours so you're that far in advance every time you're always in advance yes using yesterday's pastry the dough is gently rolled before we add the key ingredient okay and that's the butter that's the batter so it's like a whole slab of butter in the middle voila the french love rich foods and almost a third of every mouth of anno's croissants will be butter the best butter you can find on the market which is rare today because a lot of questions are made with margarine and cheap forms of fat to produce the all-important layers in a croissant the dough has to be rolled then folded rolled then folded three times to create over 70 layers of dough and butter in each croissant the pastry is cut into triangles and rolled into the famous croissant shape but you need to be gentle so as not to crush the layers it's the technique the friendship perfected and do it like this but you're addressing it it's like you're cressing uh wait it's true to caress me right caress but don't crush it every morning he has the challenge of hand rolling 400 croissants for discerning prisiens can i match his lightning speed so there's 40 croissants here yeah normally how long would that take to make no around three minutes three minutes okay three two one to match arno i needed to be able to roll one every four and a half seconds two guys don't crush this [ __ ] i'm held up 15 seconds left thanks [Music] i thought coming back to paris wouldn't be like it was like 20 years ago when i was getting my ass kicked the royal croissant are then gently heated to activate the yeast so they rise they're glazed with egg and then they're baked [Music] right seem 20 minutes and come out crispy golden and delicious the smell was taking me back 20 years smell is amazing i couldn't wait to taste if all our hard work was worth it oh my god inside perfect slight moist crisp on the outside and that bit there you see all the the layers right here 25 years of experience inside yeah and and some love oh my god that is amazing honestly and thank you for giving me a proper insight to a bit of french history it's my pleasure and my passion delicious handmade croissants are a world away from factory versions but i want to put this to the test i'm back at the garden or to conduct an unscientific but very revealing test on some francophiles well they prefer a handmade quest on by me or are they going to be conned by something processed that's the first one we've been in two questions for a week you've been eating questions all week that's great news which one out of both questions you prefer no the flakier one for this one it's got more taste oh my god this is whitewash first one was drier first one was dry moist and creamier creamier it's interesting the first one or the second one second the second one now in terms of flavor do you prefer the first one or the second one now which one you prefer the first one the second one second one second sir second one why the layer is more layered that one tastes like a proper one you might get from a decent restaurant now which one you prefer the first one or the second one second second why tasty tasty she's spot on i'm so glad the public prefer the handmade buttery croissant everyone should be asking their baker if there's a handmade croissants from a factory in france [Music] nikki how long have been the head chef at the bouchon uh about a year and a couple of months and uh what's craig like as a young sous chef does he learn quickly he does he's really he's a good crafter he loves his job

chef yes damn and nick your last table yeah well done yes yeah yeah two killers let's go you know we're going yes go please the flying rod to be honest wasn't the most overwhelming of the taste the biscuits are very strong and stays in the mouth and they're not too tasty to be honest paula my darling welcome how are you sweet i'm fine thank you good to see you i welcome to edward how do you think craig your son is doing this evening oh i think he's he's doing amazing yeah yeah he's a very determined focused young man what would it mean for him tonight to win oh i mean everything absolutely everything it just would mean the world yeah you must be very proud and watching them cook like that now um why newcastle uh why newcastle i was sent i was sent to newcastle by my bus in france so first impressions when you went up there cold cold but the the jordy girls are very very warm what was the french type of smaller like it was good i mean i really appreciated the dish uh maybe a little bit soggy at the bottom obviously the fact of the foia being on top of the brioche would you steal that dish and put it on the dushon's menu more importantly are you going to pay for the fogger we are paying for it you are playing absolutely what a gentleman a foreigner are you gonna pay for it no why not it just it was the texture the texture yeah just in terms of undercooked overcooked undercooked [Laughter] very well balanced it's a lovely texture of the soft frog with the crunches of the bread and walnuts texture was really really nice um dressing was delicious and grapes were they tasted really fresh and crunchy and full of flavor how are we moving i'm a little bit nervous i am and then i actually feel really calm because he looks really calm and controlled where does that passion come from because he is incredibly passionate about food his grandmother from the loire valley um always used to cook for ten children that she had and i think from seeing that from a very early age he just took it on what do you think of beautifully cooked melty in the mouth i have to say i think it wasn't seasoned enough i think that let it down the most important question are you going to pay for it um i said no you said no no [Music] chance fargo um panic piece it's like a gingerbread on top fargo very pink in the middle that sauce finished with apricot and some proper spinach flavor delicious for me needs a bit more color on the outside a little bit more salt slightly bland french table presentation lovely a really nice color on the foie gras fuego is more cooked inside really good foie gras nice and crisp on the outside cooked perfectly bouchon just a little bit too pink but what did the diners think the results are in how well do you think you did out of 25 i don't know i'd say 14 15. pessimistic how old do you think you did out of 25 um eric 26 26. you had one ah excellent okay first of all before i announce the results uh congratulations yeah to you both yeah i thought you did bloody well thank you gordon thank you thank you so uh yeah you go first yeah the number of customers out of 25 that are happy to pay for their foie gras is it's 15 out of 25. really good thank you uh 10 customers not wishing to pay and feedback slightly too oily slightly too oily and a bit undercooked a bit undercooked right french table yes the number of customers out of 25 are willing to pay for your foie gras is 20 out of 25 well done really well really well done really well done actually only five customers that aren't paying feedback a little bit too bland in terms of seasoning yeah both of you well done yeah thank you you're only five behind this can change you're now gonna be cooking 50 portions of your lamb and 50 portions of your grey mullet yeah make it absolutely exceptional you can pull this back easily clear down get ready for the main course well done welcome back to the f1 right now both residents are going to cook their main courses first up bush on bistro are you ready [Music] bistro signature dish is fried grain mullet with pre lentils first nico dices a carrot and onion [Music] add pre lentils a bokeh garni some veal stock and simmers for the shellfish bisque he flies off longisin heads and shells flambes with cognac and that's shellfish stock cooking with a shellfish and fish really reminds me of my time in britain he strains the mix adds cream and butter and leaves to reduce nico fillets the mullet scores the skin and fries leaving it pink in the middle the quarters set mushrooms and fries in butter we get the steps from a guy called well we call him andy mushroom we don't know his name really lentils mushrooms mullet shellfish sauce one uh creme leds on table two bouchons gray mullet with pre-lentils and steps served [Music] when you cook great mullet would you cook it like salmon and serve it a little bit pink inside or cook all the way through lightly pink slightly pink a little bit of moisture because the english is somewhat squeamish a little bit with sort of slightly pink yes yeah yes almost translucent to get there often not often but yeah every now and then the fish comes back and they ask it in a restaurant you'll be more cooked through yeah yeah i love that longer sauce yeah it needs that kind of luxuriousness with lentils yeah yes huh very good service plate and danny's absolutely eric you have an english wife yes yes what's wrong with french ladies they're too cookie they're too cocky oh too snobby snobby oh too posh i used to have a french girlfriend yeah harry perry yeah fourth place please here's what the french table of cooking for main course [Music] come on guys one for one lamb the french table sings the dish this pyreneen rack of lamb with aubergine tempura eric first prepares the spatulae a different take on pasta popular in el sass he whisks with water eggs and creme fraiche and pipes the spatula into boiling water to blanch very cold water stop the cooking straight away to make his puree eric scores an aubergine adding oil salt nutmeg herbs the provence and vagues he blends the bait flesh with a knob of butter we sell loads of portion every night eric seals his lamb and adds garlic and rosemary for the gremolata i chopped herb sauce he mixes garlic parsley not too thin i don't like when it's too thin you lose too much flavor with lemon juice and olive oil tiny pinch of salt and that's it he deep fries aubergine in tempura batter then eric fry she rolls a chop chalot and his spatula with butter [Music] and adds white wine and cream aubergine puree giroles tempura lamb it's just pink beautiful it's not nice to ask for wildlife in a restaurant peyronie in rack of lamb with tempura aubergine served [Music] it looks fantastic i love the smell the fragrance are you using rosemary in there or time what is that no it was mine you little bit of rosemary a bit of parmesan just instead of the salt yep that's a seasoning so the french have got a reputation for being arrogant would you call yourself an arrogant frenchman no i'm becoming more english um a little bit more english as you getting older you're getting more mellow exactly yeah now the scores are incredibly close so far there's only five yeah points in front of you so you can pull this back yeah keep it going yes there we are really good make sure all that seasoning is exactly the same way yes aubergine nice and crisp grandma allowed to finish on top craig lentils tasted yeah not just the first pot everything yes we chef eric last table yeah make them as good as your first table yes let's go please let's go yeah eric really well done yeah for me i think the mullet was my uh was my preferred course the flavors in it complemented a lot better i love the fish the sauce on the fish particularly was lovely it was really subtle now good to see you again talking about the green lights when i saw the presentation i thought the colors looked a bit bland and and it looked quite flat it didn't look it didn't look good yes it was absolutely beautiful it melted in the mouth every texture complemented the next so it's absolute pleasure to eat i thought my lamb was really really well cooked i like it really rare so the rest of the table thought it was undercooked i absolutely loved it it was really moist and tender how was the lamb for me the lamb it was too salty pretty and just start looking chewy big question are you going to pay for it my goodness me you're a one tough cookie aren't you huh bouchon bistro grey mullet now not the most widely renowned fish however lentils seps and a really nice longer sinju that's delicious because he's managed to enhance the flavor of the grey mullet with that amazing light longusting bisque sauce i hardly ever use cream on it but the flavor of that is delicious more importantly highly sustainable and the seps go brilliantly well with it really good right french table's lamb um beautifully cooked nice and pink aubergine puree is quite interesting giron mushrooms and a very light fragrant lamb stock there's a lot of things going on that plate however the balance is absolutely perfect my one slight concern is all this raw fat here two really seriously unique dishes however i think the grey mullet just has the edge right um first of all before with the results uh well done um seriously well done yes thank you okay jp thank you demolar this time around i'll switch around we'll start with the french table the number of customers that happy to pay for your rack of lambs out of 50 is 36 out of 50. well done that's good 14 didn't pay why not um stacking undercooked and um yeah lack of flavors yeah but listen i mean i find it hard to believe there's lots of flavors in there for me i thought the balance worked brilliantly fred you don't look very happy what's the matter because i always expect you a bit more yeah do you want to go and kill a customer no no i'm trying to understand because we give all our love and the passion in to that dish we'll be disappointed but at the time we've got the delivery okay bhushan bistro the number of customers happy to pay for your grey mullet out of 50 is it's 40 out of 50 well done [Applause] [Music] to convince the diners to pay for gay monet is bloody good news well done bistro so far you have 55 out of 75 french table you have 56 out of 75 that's amazing well done great job [Applause] okay it all comes down to dessert stay down get ready for your crepes sure well done good job right this week janet finds out which came first the chicken or the egg i've asked janet street porter to provide rare mangalits of picks and miniature dexter cattle to ensure we have the best possible meat for the final of our best local restaurant competition but i think she's still got room for one more breed i've chosen rare eggs worth poultry because they're good egg layers and great to eat but before she can begin she needs to answer the age-old question how do chickens have sex there's a man in yorkshire called chris who knows the answer and chris has got just the cocky cockle for the job he's gone without it now for about two weeks all right girls you're ready sex god is coming [Music] look at it hot to trot he's having a look what's that is that is that saying i'm ready that's it yep that's saying come and get me yeah could i ask you really something stupid do chickens have willies no they're all internalized okay we've got a little no nothing nothing bubbly bit nothing well is bum's quivering i don't know if that means he's aroused oh no hang on we're getting somewhere [Music] that's it that's it janet what's in it for her nothing i think he's getting the taste now we probably will probably straight onto another one though he pushes her on the ground yeah her tail lifts up yeah and he's literally just sperm is just dropping out of him onto her she then stores it in a sack within herself and that's that sperm that she uses for the next two to three weeks you'll actually see by the end of today's back end will be covered it'll be dripping you'll see it's dripping with what sperm oh no no too much information isn't it yeah it's been a week since janet sat in on some hot chicken sex action and now she's taking delivery of a batch of fertilized eggs ready to hatch within 24 hours i'll get on with it the first of janet's chicks begin to hatch but it's stuck in its shell acting on advice she performs an emergency exerion i've got to give this one a little bit of a helping hand he's got stuck i'm taking a bit of the shell off to give him a bit of help all right all right i've got to put it out of his misery i can't stand that tweeting there's a leg i have a leg out oh stop knocking about [Music] what's it the mother and child new chicks need to spend around three weeks gaining strength and weight under a broody lamp before they can go free range so janet books her new arrival in with a neighboring farm for some heat treatment you look a bit healthier i'll tell you what you're just like peter mandelson the ultimate survivor i'm gonna call you mandy 23 chicks from another batch have hatched and join mandy under the lamp with the birds settled and soaking up some rays all janet can do is leave them to grow under the care of a neighbor jack when janet returns to check on her chicks she's amazed at their progress god they're huge where's my mandy where's the one i hatched um well she she never grew actually came in one morning she was just dead dead as a daniel and the family the thing is i've never given birth mandy i brought mandy into the world i'm pretty pissed off man he couldn't shape up forgive me there's nothing more to say please forgive me so this is what we're left with but these have grown so much i can't wait to see how big they are in four weeks time yeah no they're certainly growing by then janet's got a healthy batch of chicks exworth mature rapidly for the table so our diners in the final can look forward to some fantastic chicken in the f-word restaurant right welcome back to the f-word now it's time for dessert [Music] crepes susettes basically pancakes a real old-school classic first off you make the batter 125 grams of flour salt 2 eggs beet make it well in the flour combine slowly add 300 ml of milk add melted butter whisk orange zest set aside to rest sauce oranges peel and segment keep juice heat 50 grams of sugar that caramel really nice and dark ground onion add the orange juice remove from heat coat oranges crepes butter flip and cook the other side fold into quarters this smells amazing spoon over orange sauce crepe susette done let's go every crate perfect yes oh let's go watch your face fred no one's got no [ __ ] hair left nico you've got five pants at work at the same time eric you've only got full gun at the same time is that the difference between brittany and paris brittany are the experts on the pancakes the french table were beaten in the main course by bouchon bistro they're clearly feeling the pressure and they seem less confident now maybe because they're just one point in the lead it's neck and neck for the french table winning could catapult this exciting suburban restaurant into the london super league just to win there's no there's no english word for that there's no english word so i'll have to find a french one it'd be fantastic for bouchon bistro success tonight could really put this rural northern restaurant on the culinary map if pusha were to win it would be just amazing i think it will really boost our confidence the pressure is on you just burn your eyebrows don't go crazy with the sauce guys there you go crazy the sauce you're gonna flood the pancake and make it soggy yeah yeah yeah they look delicious well done service please nico is a great tosser pancake it's your fault yours with a palette knife why are you opting out not tossing your pancake i'm concentrated it's an important toss yeah you're going to flip it we're going to use a spatula i think you've got the balls to flip it oh sure go on well done well done well done well done big newcastle bollocks this is fascinating because they're pretty much neck and neck however i think nico's got the edge because he's calm his collective and those pancakes are absolutely delicious eric all of a sudden has sunk into one slightly disappeared all that swagger's gone and it's less arrogant and more focused this is neck and neck yeah right those crepes are sat there saw it's coming or yeah yeah okay now you don't serve as much sauce as nikki why is that you just want a less yeah i think a bit too soggy otherwise i like my pancakes not too soy you know i get nervous when you're this quiet why have you clammed up why have you gone into one are you sulking it's a bit cheeky it's a bit thick well let it down though yeah do you need some more milk yes i told you to say something i i i feel like i'm cooking with a completely different chef so you guys started main course confident yeah now all of a sudden you've gone into one what's the matter nothing so come on keep it going come on come on come on i thought you would rise to the pressure not sink go excellent delicious looking crepes and uh yeah job well done it was absolutely delicious really nice and moist and went really well with the tang of the orange and just it was fantastic do you have a bit of a sweet tooth yeah yes yeah how are the fantastic yeah crepes did you like most about them it was they were just so light and the sauce was absolutely fantastic it wasn't too bitter it wasn't too sweet and the big question are you going to be paying for your painting i am you are yeah good i'm glad to hear you've actually closed your restaurants to be here tonight absolutely yes if you don't win will you regret closing the restaurant not at all no it's been a fantastic experience we loved it no regrets whatsoever our customers are supporting us all the way fingers crossed can we take this one yes uh more importantly whatever happens at the end of this result um you should be incredibly proud of your team and you should be incredibly proud of yourself yeah definitely thank you thank you if we win you'll be able to hear her from newcastle i'm not kidding you she'll be like an atomic bomb going off i thought my dessert was uh was okay to be honest i i like the crepes were well cooked um they had good flavor but it lacked a bit of sauce and the fruit could have done with a bit more and i thought the flavor wasn't as strong as it could have been i love the crap absolutely just really soft crispy on the outside as well it's just perfect not overcooked not stodgy light fluffy went down really nice dessert yes um it was a little bit too thick for the plants yeah and i didn't think there was enough sauce and not enough i was waiting for a bit more of a punch they were cooked by your husband i'm sure they were damn yeah so it's really nerve-wracking now are you going to pay for them no i don't you're not paying for your husband's credit no not today that's very fair-minded yeah and how's it going to be in the back of the taxi on the way home tonight not very good one of the first one yeah i think so one in the spare room so the results are in and it's time to find out exactly who will be crowned the f word's best local french restaurant good luck to you both yes jb okay french table gonna go first with you yes and for your dessert out of 25 you got [Music] 9 out of 25. that is a big kick in the bollocks uh why okay the the main reason is the crepe was too thick lack of sauce as one not enough sauce on the plates you adjusted the thickness halfway through did you know they were going out that thick it was thick of our wanted yes but not fake no and they were that thick that your wife didn't pay for them okay bouchon if you get 10 out of 25e dessert you tie and then i'll decide who wins if you get more than 10 then you are the f word's best local french restaurant cool okay out of 25 customers the amount they're happy to pay for your crepe suzette is [Music] it's 17. well done two fantastic courses [Music] really really really good okay bouchon congratulations you're now third on the leaderboard i hope to see you in the semi-final congratulations i can't speak honest to god i'm

Pre-order your copy of Ramsay in 10 here...",2022-11-27 22:16:02.926159, i think a fantastic sunday roast is the cornerstone of home cooking it's what the rest of the week's meals are built around and i absolutely love it but that doesn't mean it can't be improved to make the most out of my roast my main course is the delicious stuffed roast rib of beef complete with tangy horseradish yorkshire puddings [Music] but first i'm enlisting the help of my eldest 15 year old megan to reinvent one of my all-time favorite classic desserts eaton mess bomb right eat a mess what's the one thing you love about is a mess i love the meringues now this is a eaten mess with a twist what's the twist in it compared to the normal one we're gonna freeze it so it's almost like a sort of eaten mess bomb wow now i'd like you to whisk the cream please half the strawberries are going to go through the mix and half the strawberries are going to be turned into a coulis strawberries in first a little dusting of icing sugar into the pan and now the icing sugar will withdraw the sweetness from the strawberries and start caramelizing so let me show you a nice quick way of whisking secret whisking is like 10 seconds on and 10 seconds off that way your arms don't get tired now i'm going to take the cream to a three-quarter stage what is a three-quarter mix so we leave some sort of texture in the cream that's what we call three-quarter whip you've got a nice soft peak they're caramelized there you go we'll put a little touch of water in there that'll help break down the sugar and turn that into a really nice strawberry liquid now to get it really nice and fine i'm gonna blend it on and blitz off okay that's fine i want you to use the back of the spoon and push that through the sieve okay now that way you don't get those seeds it smells so good i love this now nice this is the exciting part hold up oh mag megan right now the meringue with your fingers just crush and flake the meringue into the cream how big should i crush it dado there nice big chunks okay lovely oh you okay yeah come on rang in my eye damn to make this dessert even easier i often cheat by using good quality shop port meringues a little taste that's just cream and meringue wow it's a little tasty okay strawberries in next a couple of spoons of the cooling now look at that now to prepare the mold to transform the traditional eaten mess into a frozen bomb form a triple layer of clim film adding water to the bowl will help the climb film stick as i pour that in i want you to spread it down okay at the bottom and push it down can you hear that crunch yeah the line all right now fold the cling film over put that in the freezer please make young please in the freezer she goes [Music] dessert done now for our main course with a twist that is the rib eye we've had that in the fridge not wrapped so it sort of almost air dries and it intensifies the flavor gross so much quicker and there's less water in the beef for me the only downside to perfect roast dinner is the fight about who washes up afterwards so meg and i are going to avoid that by cooking everything in one roasting tin starting with the spinach and mushroom stuffing [Music] let's do it with a salt and pepper please good girl some of your left shoulder left shoulder thank you in with the garlic and the mushrooms to toss the pan you push down and pull back down and push back off you go take your time push it down and flip very good that's it push down nice that was lovely and again nice i'm gonna drop let's see well done well done well then right we're gonna sort of make a little well a little touch of butter in the middle now we need to start putting the spinach in the middle piece so you can push that down the spinach is cold so you're not going to burn yourself be confident in the pan toss it and you'll see it wilting and disintegrating away wow who would have thought all that spinach could fit in this pan because it's a very delicate leaf it sort of cooks so quickly put this all on your board now and then i just want you to go and give that a nice chop then when you're confident with one hand we need to pick up the other knife the other hand chop it nicely good now outside and come in gently good regroup and take your time good mmm right i love that smell what is that lemon thyme lemon tan that's right so you get your little thyme stalks and you pour down you sort of strip lemon thyme in now tarragon it'll taste brilliant with the beef fantastic with chicken and fish roughly chop the tarragon and i sprinkle the fresh breadcrumbs so the breadcrumbs almost sort of bring the stuffing together next we're gonna get an egg yolk now with the beef this is the exciting part slice with the bone and then come inside and go two thirds of the way down hold that open for daddy salt and pepper and then look we pack our stuffing in there this is amazing it's incredible now just gently hold out there like that okay yeah i'll see you tomorrow what tying string around the rib will keep it all together during roasting not too tight if we tie it too tightly what happens the stuffing will come out that's right that's ready for roasting but we're gonna protect it and sit it on a trivet so a trivet basically is almost like a sort of little little bed a little bed that's right if you want to enjoy these delicious roast vegetables at their best make sure you remove them from the hot oven after 35 minutes and reheat before serving with your beef now a little mix for the top a couple of teaspoons of mustard powder in salt a couple of tablespoons of olive oil mix that in i'm gonna pour my mustard powder over the beef so this forms a really nice glaze my one pot roast dinner goes into a hot oven 15 minutes at 230 degrees then down to 170 degrees for another two hours for a delicious twist on traditional yorkshire puds i'm going to lace mine with fresh horseradish [Music] start with plain white flour in a bowl and crack in the eggs adding only half of your milk at this stage makes it much easier to whisk all the lumps out and if like me you like your puddings a little lighter and crispier add a dribble of cold water and add salt to season when you're happy your batter is lump free whisk in the remaining milk peel and grate horseradish and add a handful to the mix we can leave the batter to rest while we get the meat from the oven that is beautiful and this is where you really need to let it rest how long would you say to rest it for um i like to rest the meat for at least 20 minutes just the right amount of time for us to whack up the oven and to get our yorkshire puddings in i love using the rich dripping but vegetable all is a healthier option to get the fluffiest yorkshires your tray and fat must be piping hot for best results take your jug of batter to the oven and pour the mixture in there it takes just 15 minutes for our yorkshire puds to puff themselves up and turn a delicious golden brown with the yorkshire puddings on the way and the beef rested we can finish off the eater mess bomb run the bowl under the hot water twist and pull nice wow look at that beauty it's amazing sit that on to your plate now the finishing touches a drizzle of the remaining strawberry coulis i'm just going to pour this over amazing flavor and some grated mint chocolate and that is a nice twist on a classic eaten mess a delicious eat and mess bomb beautiful let's go baby please don't drop that meg please it's not a rounders match dessert sorted and the beef is ready to serve up lift that up place that onto the board parsnips parrots you can see why we kept them in halves they've got all that flavor one beautiful big slice for daddy one for maggie and then on the side it's stuffing the stuffing a bit that's the best to die for now fantastic yorkshire they're amazing aren't they beautiful mm-hmm that's for my daddy i met one that's for me beautiful roast beef with a twist wow [Music] these are my ultimate classics with a twist juicy river beef with horseradish spiked yorkshire puds and scrummy eaten mess bomb topped with strawberry coulis and mint chocolate crispy roasted with pancakes with the added kick of a black bean dipping sauce megan you're gonna help with the duck danny your favorite yes it is now how's your boyfriend right i'm going come on that woke you up didn't it so what do you love most about duck the dipping sauce the dipping sauce i love that let's get the duck in the oven first let's get a bit of salt in there please then some pepper thank you some spring onion garlic and ginger now why do you think we pour that in there season it and flavor it how come you put them in hole like that and not smaller it's going inside i'm not using it for sauce or anything so it's just going to make it really nice what are they star anita sorry so what happens as the duck roasts on the outside it creates this really nice perfume aroma inside tuck that in there to get it spicy rub all that chinese fire spice yeah over almost like you're massaging good so make sure you get it all in even the little wings you know underneath there just like i used to do to you in the bath i used to wash your little handys i know those days are long gone i know i know i know that is seriously spicy with the duck there's generally quite a lot of fat there yeah so we're gonna put it on this little bench okay and that goes there by slowly roasting it okay it's gonna get nice and crisp on the outside all that fat is gonna render inside the breast so therefore it's gonna get all nice and juicy yeah right ducks in three and a half hours at 160 degrees celsius your favorite part you said was the dipping sauce why is it your favorite part i think it really adds to the dark it makes it really tasty cena's is your favorite you can make it i'm gonna do nothing okay daddy's gonna put his feet up so uh first off the garlic there's one good girl watch your fingers please always do good nice oh you're fast huh watch your fingers i am watch your fingers slide slow down please 14. all right that's enough right little teaspoon of olive oil in a few years time i'll be teaching how to drive as well as cook how exciting is that you know in a car scary okay garlic in crispy duck is traditionally served with hoisin sauce but my brood love the additional big bold punch of black beans nice megan and i add soy sauce and lastly for that classic chinese sweet and sour element brown rice vinegar and honey are you happy with the flavour i'm really happy you can taste everything in there dipping sauce done duck's in the oven let's start the dessert the most amazing tata tan are those pink peppercorns they are pink peppercorns they're really good they don't taste anything like black peppercorns quite sweet aren't they they're really sweet very fruity the pink peppercorns give it the sweetness the black peppercorns give the heat now what is that baby vanilla this is one of the easiest desserts in the world to make but one of the most delicious it's a sort of take on the classic apple or pear to tan but when you caramelize those bananas with the peppercorns and the vanilla i bet that tastes amazing oh my goodness incredible okay i'm gonna make the caramel start off with the cold pen first and you just press that butter in there how come do you do it like that and not let it just melt naturally because i want the butter to stay cold because i'm gonna stick the bananas in there okay and then we'll make the caramel and caramelize the bananas at the same time so in goes those vanilla vanilla seeds pods in there as well okay peppercorns done yeah well done good girl sprinkle them over that butter just naturally naturally nice and then look just very carefully sprinkle sugar over that you're doing them all the same size roughly the same size wedge it into the butter well do you know what i want the bananas really caramelized you just stuck them between if you crown them in like this okay it will stop them moving around nothing's moving nothing is okay so all wedged in there sprinkle the peppercorns on top of the banana so you got that flavor in the caramel and on the top and the bottom right puff pastry puff pastry is difficult and time consuming to make so i always buy ready made when i'm at home to get the best flavor and texture go for the all butter type and keep your pastry cold before using it and this is where it gets really exciting you get your fingers you just pinch the ends so you thin the end if you do that for me very carefully have to be quick because the heat of your fingers can melt the pastry how comes you do it dad because we get it nice and thin so we can clip it underneath now take a spoon and what we do is lift up that banana and tuck it underneath see little like a parcel and see the thin bits of pastry yeah how easy it is to get it underneath yeah and that's why you thin them out you do it so quickly well because i have to be quick otherwise the pastry will melt notice how we're not using anything sharp so we're not would that cut the pastry that's right see how locked down that is [Music] gas on we'll start caramelizing her those three little holes are so important if we didn't put a hole in the pastry and it will cause a lot of steam so the pastry never cooks it just goes really soggy okay so really important the caramel is live now we're working the camel give a little shake how can you see the caramel through the pastry look what happens when it tilts oh yeah see all comes running down see yeah i see now that pastry okay it's like clinging on to the bananas and so when we turn it upside down we've got this glove full of these caramelized bananas look at that wow it looks like it look a locky look a locky ah look at likey got it now baby is your birthday soon 15. i've just worked it out on my 50th you're 18. perfect we

duck to rest and 20 minutes in the oven 190 to 200 degrees for our banana tartar tan time to knock up a quick hoisin and cucumber salad to put in our crispy duck pancakes for the dressing combine hoisin sauce rice wine vinegar soy sauce a dash of sesame oil and to give it that zingy asian punch some freshly grated root ginger [Music] for the salad trim and cut spring onions into very fine

dessert it's an incredible but easy hazelnut meringue tower guaranteed to wow your mates start with the basic meringue separate four egg whites [Music] and whisk [Music] gradually add caster sugar [Music] until the mix forms stiff glossy peaks gently fold in ground and chopped hazelnuts [Music] a trick we use in the restaurants is to use the mix to stick baking sheets down which makes them easy to spread and stops the sheets blowing around [Music] top your meringues with more finely chopped hazelnuts and bake for 25 minutes and the trick to stop them cracking is to turn the oven off and let them cool inside for the filling melt dark chocolate in a bowl over simmering water and slightly cool whip the cream until it forms soft peaks and gently fold in three quarters of the melted chocolate until combined build your towel with alternate layers of chocolate cream and meringue [Music] finally drizzle over the remaining melted chocolate to decorate a simple yet luxurious dessert your

dijon say dijon a nice little squeeze of honey love honey good a little splash of aged balsamic and this is your favorite this one isn't it i just like the it has a nice sweetness but then it has a better nest to it too nice next to virgin novel why do we have to use a whisk not just a spoon the purpose of using a whisk is so it can emulsify and more importantly you're bringing all the ingredients together taste it's so yummy that is delicious isn't it a good tip to loosen any vinaigrette and give it a lighter taste is add a spot of water now the juice of a lemon squeeze the lemon

morning the treat here is in that little baby honey so that sweetens it so just start off with 200 ml of delicious honey into a pan just to warm up in she goes now i know these are a chef's favorite but it makes all the difference especially for breakfast a fresh vanilla pod and i think of the way that i use herbs to add flavor to soups and salads i'd like to think the vanilla does exactly the same scrape out all those wonderful seeds in now the staple of the granola is the oats [Music] next puff rice delicious crunchy but light and fluffy next add wheat bran and your seeds pumpkin sunflower and linseed and then almonds incredible that nice heavy weight from the nut bunch now bring the honey to the boil slowly drizzle that amazing honey in give that a really good mix coat the granola with the hot honey just slowly churn it using the outside of the bowl you can see it just getting nice and sticky once the granola is completely coated in honey it's ready to bake now spread the mix on baking paper i'm gonna season it lightly with a touch of salt on top the salt throughout dries up the oats and the honey will roast color and glaze the granola nice into the oven for 25 to 30 minutes [Music] 10 minutes into the cooking simply run a spoon across the top to turn the mix and ensure it's crunchy all over you smell that light roast look at the color honestly look it's crispy it's delicious now i'm going to tart it up and put some lovely dried cranberries that just gives us chewy sweet flavor delicious and then finally these beautiful berries goji berries goji berries are high in antioxidants and have been eating china for centuries for their healing properties but you can add any dried fruit you like the cranberry and the goji berries gives it that nice chewy rich texture to the granola now this is the best way to store it it looks incredible really incredible look at that that eat well stay well right milk my homemade crunchy granola it looks good tastes good and it's packed with healthy grains superfood berries and seeds it's incredibly good for you too a breakfast for champions for my ultimate light lunch a beautiful quinoa salad with amazing textures and fresh aromatic flavors to excite the palette add one part pre-rinse quinoa to two parts cold water if you're not using pre-rinsed the quinoa grains should be soaked before use to remove their bitter coating bring to a simmer and cook for about 20 minutes until the water is absorbed spoon the cooked quinoa onto a plate and spread out to cool [Music] meanwhile dry roast flaked almonds in a frying pan once golden add raisins chopped mint and spring onions peel strips of skin from a whole cucumber to make stripes then remove the seeds and chop into half moon slices add half cherry tomatoes and the cooled quinoa and gently mix in with your fingers [Music] season with salt and pepper dress with a good squeeze of lime and drizzle of olive oil finish with a few fresh mint leaves spicy mexican soup it's hearty delicious robust but served with some tortillas and a wonderful salsa it's almost like a complete meal in one starting with some finely chopped red onions for my soup let's get some heat going early these are chipotle so they're smoky rich they don't come with any warning signal and these are seriously hot so be adventurous but beware a nice teaspoon of toasted cumin oregano dried now start frying off spices the heat you'll see the chilies start swelling up delicious garlic be quite generous on the oil because that helps to blow out the chili right now those onions and garlic are on fire we're going to balance the sort of heat from the chipotle with sugar turn up the heat and really start caramelizing that sugar and the chili gives off the most amazing aroma next fry up a tablespoon of tomato puree add a can of chopped tomatoes cook kidney beans and vegetable or chicken stock to cover there's something quite exciting about big and bold flavors because in the restaurants you have to be somewhat controlled you can't go crazy so cooking these kind of dishes at home gives me that kind of release chilis particularly when they're dried continue to swell and release their heat as they're cooked so the longer you cook your dish the hotter it will be [Music] but it's not as powerful it needs to be yet and every five six seven eight minutes that's gonna get stronger hotter and more delicious bring that up to the ball and cook that out for 15 minutes whilst i allow the chili heat to infuse i'm going to crack on with quick crunchy tortilla chips and a fabulously fresh and spicy tomato salsa known in mexico as pico de gallo start by finely dicing three ripe tomatoes one or two deceded fresh jalapeno peppers and half a red onion then chop a good handful of fresh coriander add the juice from two limes salt and pepper and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil for the tortilla chips rub a little olive oil onto six large shop bought wheat wraps sprinkle with smoked paprika and gently massage in cut each wrap into triangles and spread them onto a baking tray bake for three to four minutes in a preheated oven 180 degrees until golden brown and leave to cool to complete my mexican lunch i need to finish my deliciously fragrant spicy soup [Music] the spice is there it is absolutely spot on now for the cooling down process the mexicans are brilliant at building layer upon layer of flavor with delicious chilis and spices but they're also experts at tempering their dishes with cooling ingredients like avocado sour cream and cheese that's why you can take that amount of chili you've got a spoon of richness spice and all of a sudden avocados almost like a little fire blanket over those chillies to further counter the chilli heat mexicans use a rich tangy crumbly cheese but i'm sprinkling on lancashire which is a great british substitute and last but not least cooling fresh coriander one delicious spicy mexican soup serve that with your tortilla chips and your pico de gallo salsa a phenomenal blend of textures and layers and spice and creaminess big bold and delicious

revise aj is tamer's father no that's your table that's your kebab i don't see the fish and chips man no you don't understand we put all this trust in him oh never mind the kitchen has completely fallen apart it's got to stop it's got to stop so we put him in the front of the house to act as the general manager just so we don't have to fire him because that is my partner's father can i help you with something i'll be talking to the customers flirting with the ladies and asking about the food in between on a business level i can't stand a man every night during hours he gets wasted he

some changes but i wasn't gonna be allowed to make them because the owner's really happy with the menu it's just unfortunate that we have to take money from other avenues to try to make the place survive i'm the one that has the most investment i have almost a half a million dollars invested if we're about to lose this business i can't recover scott feels that we are running the business into the ground and he's losing all of his money we owe fairway eleven thousand dollars i mean we owe back sales taxes we owe back payroll taxes when you start getting to owing the government money then you know that's an issue if things don't change i don't know how to make the place survive [Music] taking advantage of the frozen lake gordon snowmobiles his way to jacks wow absolutely amazing this restaurant is centrally located at the heart of five great lakes but they're in trouble i don't know why and i'm about to find out unbelievable jacks wow what a place nice to see you nice to have you gordon come on in i'm actually not nervous but i hope he loves the food of course um aj so you're the owner no but scott is here and they are here yes and scott is the bouncer no why are you standing there looking for a fight come over here that's the way he's standing how are you doing how are you doing good good nice to see you nice to see you too are you in training or what i've been training

nice to meet you another gym nice to meet you yeah after meeting two owners and a general manager gordon decides to talk to each of them individually so that they can be totally honest about the problems at jacks now what kind of hours you put in 65 a week and scott put 65 in no we had to move him out of the restaurant he was scaring my employees holy [ __ ] [Music] why was scott pushed out because he's lost a ton of customers because of the things that he did we got complaints complaints and complaints why would you scare customers away you know i'm not sure maybe because i was intense you know but i want to be more involved what's the problem with the restaurant we have terrible food what's the problem with the restaurant i personally don't see a problem with the business it's really good okay um what's the problem with the restaurants aj what's he drinking you know he drinks oozo all the time you just turn around and drink a quick shot that's what he does he makes a hundred thousand dollars a year 100 grand yes ridiculous oh my god three individuals three completely different stories i haven't even tasted the food yet where'd you start oh my god okay here we go hmm right nice to see without eric it's really important for me to see as much as possible i would try this omelette here oh it's crabs just split with a cake it looks like crap oh crap omelettes i'll definitely take one of the uh k on this okay i'm gonna go after that for the uh honey pecan salmon okay and then um good old-fashioned fish and chips oh good yeah thanks excellent [Music] you just sat there staring at me like some big muscle head meatball [ __ ] me aaron what why do you swallow your crab with a k on the ground because it's not wrist mock crab me i didn't want anybody to get the misconception it's artificial guarantee no complaints on this guaranteed that's a pretty bold statement excellent thank you my darling wow look at the size of that that's a lot of crap and you haven't told me about the k yet oh he said he wanted everybody to know that it wasn't real crab it's artificial crab so he spelled it with a case so there was no misconception so it's fake crab meat in the seafood restaurant on the water [Music] oh [ __ ] me holy crap rubber tasteless that's going straight to the trash oh my god he hated it why the fake crab was the number one reason the omelette didn't go over well doesn't like the crab in there i i've never that was already here i didn't buy that stuff i don't want to use frozen fish it's not product that i'm absolutely overly proud of but at the same point i'm held accountable for all the inventory that the owners have paid for how's the food so far why are we serving fake crabbing anomaly i don't you did that you're the general manager why'd you laugh i give the choice have you been drinking no the crab was shocking embarrassing and fake it tastes disgusting have you tasted that crap no i'm extremely allergic to crab and shrimp so i can't believe it there's nothing crab in there i understand it's monkey fish oh my god i'll let you finish your meal general manager my ass i'm being blamed he thinks that ashley did allow him to do that before letting him serve those types of crashes because it's great cram aj's the general manager he's supposed to oversee the food and now i'm hoping and praying that gordon says aj is the one that's bleeding his business okay fish and chips certainly the best looking thing i've seen somebody rubbery is it frozen the fish i believe it's frozen it is frozen when you take a bite of that cod it's almost like you've got a breaded condom in your mouth he said it was rubbery uh too greasy and it just said it tasted like a frozen cotton obviously he hit it right on the button so this is the same recipe that we've used here forever so i am for change i want to change good [Music] wow this one is the salmon look at that thank you sweet [Music] damn everything's just so sweet the dressing is like honey and so much of it absolutely disgusting quite possibly one of the worst salmon dishes i've ever eaten it's a pretty successful opinion though after one of the worst meals he's ever had this is chef aaron gordon begins to explore how this perfectly situated seafood restaurant can serve such dreadful food that was horrendous why are you serving fake crab meat it's inventory that we have have you tasted that it's plain there's nothing to it it's just disgusting plastic it's exactly what it is the salmon dish that was shipped at its best sweet on sweet on sweet and sweet that's actually one of the top sellers that's why the place has got such a [ __ ] reputation for crap food it's still not clear who's in charge of the food he's in charge of food it's not true i have no control i follow you guys being thrown under the bus because all the recipes and the things that he didn't enjoy are things that were set in place before i even got here who's controlling the [ __ ] menu the owners are scott is that what you wanted here not at all i don't have nothing to do with food what aj i want answers there are certainties are not under my control you're the general manager i tried not to have it go on but i get overruled aj has many excuses and never wants to own up to his faults it's terrible aj it's got to be your responsibility no law [Music] with no one taking responsibility for any of the problems gordon knows the best way to get any answers is to observe tonight's dinner service okay how would you like that cooked all right it's our first order we got tables tamara how are you doing brother after working a full day at his other job good to meet you nice to meet you tamara the restaurant's third partner arrives let me ask you straight out what do you think is wrong with the restaurant the food's like hitting this it's inconsistent yeah and forget the father figure now but isn't aj responsible for the food and beverage in terms of running the restaurant and the kitchen yes every time i asked aj to what was going on he was blaming the owners i do have the most difficult position being here i'm working with my friends and my father who is my family and that makes everything very difficult it sucks i'm gonna have a look around spend time in the kitchen the dyeing room chef it's good to meet you yeah livewise finally this rice has issues take this out and at least try to stir it up or something you brought it up man i gotta move it there's not enough depth in our kitchen yeah i got a big chunk here too what the [ __ ] man they've been set in their ways i don't know that they want to conform to a change do we have any rice yet nope i threw it out oh my god with a clear lack of support in the kitchen i'm [ __ ] here aaron has yet to send out the first wave of orders so it's christmas my lead is table 11. they don't have any food if it doesn't come in 15 minutes 15 minutes here's a big blue fillet up top 45 minutes into the dinner service and food is finally beginning to leave the kitchen [Music] keep it going 64 calamari i'll take it anytime as the dishes get rushed to the dining room customers are receiving food that's not exactly the way they ordered it we gotta send this back what's wrong with that it's supposed to be uh well done and it's rare and well done steak is the easiest steak in the world to cook nearby we need this medium on the fly it was overcooked there were the cheeses she said she said it's terrible she didn't like it i needed chicken alfredo on the fly i hate that okay he wants this under the heat for read it here dude we're weeded here i've never seen frozen food so [ __ ] complicated unbelievable an absolute meltdown not just in the kitchen but the dining room as well just under 20 dishes have come back and more frustratingly it's frozen food they can't even cook that right unbelievable [Music] where'd your dad go i don't know [Music] aj's gonna have to get back up where is he [Music] aj is a general manager here now and he needs to be overseeing the restaurant we won't probably be coming back here the food was wrong we're gonna take care of this and then you know please come back because it's only going to get better i don't know now just cop it buy them around on me okay so much money lost you guys i'm getting i'm giving away every damn meal that i have tonight everything i'm giving away free [Music] honest to god the last hour everything we gave away is free oh my god can i get any worse i'm watching food get thrown away in the garbage can that's my money going out the window it's just a disappointment i let it go on this long [Music] after a chaotic dinner service with numerous dishes coming back and comp food gordon confronts the owners with an important question that has yet to be answered who has the final say at jax we haven't come to an agreement on that we've only been in the business for one year aj he's been in the business for 40 years and we were relying on that to drive us to where we needed to be and he has let us down that's the truth that's what it is right so that's a tough spot for you yes my dad has made many mistakes here but my partners need to step up and understand he's my father and that makes everything very difficult you have to separate the father son nothing to do with business you have to let go that's the first and foremost crucial thing in this [ __ ] restaurant understandable i think aj is the main reasons why this business is extremely in whole and he's still taking his damn check every damn week we aj you're the one that makes all the money not us you know yeah how many hours are we got that doesn't matter i put the money up not for you to lose it i put it up because aj was supposed to be a 40-year restaurant let me say something i booked eight parties big parties by thousands of dollars and that's the thankfulness i get from this man he's acting like a child you know be a man face up story after story after story after story i'm so sick of it i'm pissed [Music] there's so much food coming back last night that's not normal in any restaurant so i decided to get in early this morning have a good look around for any member of the staff come in [Music] that is salmon that's just marinaded in it's like an italian dressing oh dear what's this oh seafood restaurant on the water

walking around want to get up to speed look at the ingredients check him what is that is that just taken from the steam table and dumped on the trolley and then whisked it in that's exactly what it is

father doesn't want to deal with the back vowels the back house is falling apart that's my frustration i'm sorry but it's not right it's got to be somebody's responsibility i'm not going to take

really mad right now they can't go on like this get everyone together we're gonna just get everything cleaned up start scrubbing walls cleaning all the stoves get rid of all that food in there

my god if you feel something then you pull it up perch i mean very tasty oh very tasty do you ever get into jacks to eat yes oh yes i do what's the food like in there i don't like their fish so much

think of right a really nice chowder yeah i'm gonna do a little poached salmon as well so salmon in three or four minutes in there the whole thing has to ooze fresh out of the core bouillon your broth over two easy dishes to make the pressure less on the line i'm excited yeah i hope you are with the special set gordon decides to implement one other change to the dinner service scott you said you want to be more involved tonight run a section present a menu welcome them hand over take the order push the specials and serve scott he's gonna get beat up really bad tonight i'd like to laugh at him a little bit he's gonna be running your section tonight give him your apron yeah i think we've got enough string to go around um yeah prove that you're not some scary monster that wants to beat the crap out of everybody does that large egg have a smile or not sure give us one yeah oh [ __ ] it now okay yeah good luck push your specials excite them don't scare them with customers starting to arrive scott is embracing being a waiter the kitchen seems ready with the new specials i'll keep my eye in the window and communicate with you and everyone seems ready to make tonight's service a success i believe we have balsamic or vinegar we would prefer balsamic if we if i don't have you know bear with me if we don't have balsamic is raspberry okay okay how's he doing he's doing good he's doing that you're watching he's doing great why is his head all tilted like that i don't know what happened i have everything right after you guys thank you roly-poly look at chimpanzee hanging over a cage looking for something else [Music] it's a half hour into dinner service and the new fresh seafood specials are a popular choice i'm gonna have a boat saying fish chowder as the tickets pile in three special salmon and a chowder the challenge now is getting the food out god i need those special salmon gulo special what i'd call for stuff and they'd be not listening to my organization and what i wanted to have come up to the hot plate one piece of salmon did you season it with salt like i said oh [ __ ] eat it i need it yesterday get it done not one table come out of this kitchen completed yet [Music] [ __ ] it come on it's so frustrating looking at the cooks behind the line because they don't actually give a damn so aaron's got his work cut out and he can't work with that dead wood no chance with aaron's orders falling on deaf ears i'm dying dying for those alfredo's very little food has left the kitchen where's our food we haven't waited 45 minutes to an hour for our food shaking that's getting bad getting momentum calm down look you guys it didn't say cheese on the ticket i can't have cheese on the burger what are we gonna do we gotta fix this i don't know nothing well they're waiting forever for this food beyond it i i don't know about time they start showing the guy a little bit of respect but they're not tell me that one day it's just rude i need a new bun for this kid burger please anton give me a new bun on now aaron look at me he's got to do it yeah you can't mop up for them can we run that come right back for that kid burger please [Music] the place is going down in flames the tickets are backed up nothing's coming out it turned into a total disaster an hour into dinner service virtually no food has left the kitchen my god and aaron who's only been working at the restaurant for a matter of weeks just toast me a croissant i need it yesterday i don't know what that is now faces the prospect of running the kitchen alone why do my items take so long there's too much of a headphone here i want to talk to you about it seriously to get it [ __ ] right and each every one of you have to step up to the mark this ration hasn't got long to go unless we change we're changing with or without you so do as a chef says and listen okay it was good that chef ramsay came in and kicked them between the legs and mate said hey get your [ __ ] together or get out you got 84 coming my way right grill fry okay good burger no cheese finally okay special salmon panko perch up top 84 up top good food is finally coming out of the kitchen and scott is finally getting comfortable as a waiter i get not anything out of your way guys although diners are enjoying the new seafood specials how's the fresh perch great yes the rest of the menu is a disaster i need this a little bit more that's not meant well the complaint's gonna go straight back to the kitchen whoever's cooking shrimp's over cooking it they've gotta know before service do we tell them after the next dish is gonna be overcooked as well it could be done straight away okay yeah customer can wait aj when they're in a crunch in the kitchen aj sometimes gets confused aj hey jay who's calling me of course we laugh because he waddles away but at the end of the day it's really not funny the kitchen needs to know first my friend then they stop [ __ ] overcooking it that's your job we got a complaint on the shrimp aaron listen listen we got a complaint on the shrimp series poorly cooked food or it was under cooked food or they weren't happy with the food we lost it we lost control is that ready this is not ready no this is not ready come on big boy sick of this [ __ ] we're going down quicker than the titanic they get better service at a shelter than they do here what the [ __ ] dude i don't know everything was screwed up give it to me again without all the grease in the bottom food got screwed up i need the whole sandwich we made but pissed off [Music] with yet another meltdown in the kitchen chef ramsay knows drastic changes are needed aaron there's no one behind there that respect you enough as the head chef and you need to stamp your authority on that kitchen i mean a joke it is a joke you're not an [ __ ] for your staff they're there to support you and i'm more [ __ ] off with you aj because you pass it to him if this was my restaurant your salary will be cut by 50 half your salary can benefit crucial areas that need supporting right now that's a big thing he is the motivation for me being here so cutting my dad's salary that's not a simple thing to do and i'm not a heartless cold-hearted person tomorrow there's gonna be major changes we're relaunching this place and i am gonna have them crammed in here like [ __ ] sardines in order to be ready for the relaunch gordon's team works all night to make jax a more inviting seafood restaurant now all night we've been working yeah we've made some really nice exciting subtle changes it's

you guys are killing me down there you're bringing the whole kitchen to an end with anarchy in the kitchen the only person that should be giving orders back here is aaron is that understood everybody the former silent partner decided it was time to speak up i'd like to hear an answer yes sir all right that's it [ __ ] believable scott came back here and he showed that he gave a [ __ ] you know where before i'd never see scott that actually helped me okay let's go i'm looking for a fish taco [Music] there's taco thank you beautiful that's nice looking food with aaron now finally controlling his kitchen orders are getting to the customers a lot quicker all right i almost have a smile on my face guys i'm almost smiling [Music] keep it going i'm more importantly you've got clarity with your [ __ ] brigade i agree dinner winds down thank you guys there's a problem with the night's final order of onion rings that look undercooked way on the cover chef aaron clearly follows gordon's advice and demands quality food and respect from his staff martini what are you doing smoking cigarette did you sell those things those onion rings earlier so you could go do that no go look at them they're [ __ ] man all my onion rings have been beautiful look at them don't touch them i was in the bag going touch up bathroom man touch them i'll drop them again right now god damn that [ __ ] it can't happen good last table tonight the food has to be just as good at the end of the night as it is in the beginning holding his staff accountable till the last minute aaron is finally acting like a head chef scott yes good job with what you do with the kitchen oh thanks thank you i feel my partners realize that you know what i can be a benefit here enjoy it yeah this helped me redeem myself to my partners i think that gordon ramsay saved my friendship my partnership and this business [Music] only for the first time in this restaurant saw each and every one of the owners working their ass off none of you were fragmented it was together we fixed the biggest problem in jax and that was the food now you know what it's like to maintain that tama what's the most important thing you've got out of this week i got a partner seriously the most important thing i got a lovely compliment when i first met you big boy honestly i thought your days were numbered the rumors the crap and you've turned it around we know what we're doing if we put our minds together and we work together we can fill this place absolutely right there's only one thing excuse me tamara i bill we've all admitted that you know we kind of put ourselves out there aj never admitted to nothing you know a lot of this was his fault [Music] i never said i have no fault and i did the best i can with all the hours that i made let me talk for a second on that exact point you are here way too much to be effective i know you think you're effective we don't think you're effective at 80 hours a week aj it would be the most generous thing you could do as a father for his son to step back cutting back on the hours and cutting back on the pay not a problem yeah not a problem i hope scott valentimer will see that the hours i put here were needed to run the business they probably will see it maybe on my deathbed they'll confess it but not before then that's hard that with that i've been agonizing over the conversation it wasn't a personal thing at all it was it's needed for him too he can't be here that many hours it's good for everybody i can't wait yes to get back yes we're bringing you to the gym when you come back take care gordon thank you good night guys thank you for everything keep pumping yes yes sir after gordon left in the days that followed bill scott and tamar gave aaron the full authority to run the kitchen the menu and the staffing if you have anybody in here that has to go tonight you can remove them tonight aaron immediately fired two cooks and brought in two experienced sous chefs they don't know the way it was before and there will be a new standard side and the partners realized although it was difficult they needed a new general manager to take over jax and so they fired aj he let it happen and what is done he did to himself you're right i can't put it on me you're right it just sucks that it is because that's your dad but you got my support firing my dad is what i need for this place to survive and he's going to back us up on what we need to do just like any father would that loves her son we're now moving in the right direction we actually finally know what we're doing i think it's awesome we do three four nights like this it'll be a breeze back here thank you gordon this was an experience of a lifetime the three of us as owners have never been as close as we are right now [Music] you

Pre-order your copy of Ramsay in 10 here - https://l...",2022-11-27 22:16:02.926159, welcome to death kitchen how are you feeling how are you it's very good fine thank you what's the secret about tonight's service what are you going to do differently we're going to do everything perfectly gorgeous everything perfectly yes chef got to hear it actor how are you i'm very excited um just want to serve my customers yeah now i need one of you can walk out here this evening as a winner yes yeah you're here because you're the best you gotta prove it now curry corner from cheltenham and la san from birmingham are our top two indian contenders here's how i found them we're a nation of curry fans it's one of britain's favorite dishes i knew the f word viewers nominated hundreds of indian restaurants but we could only choose two to compete in the f-word kitchen the search took us all over britain determined to find the very best we went to visit your culinary heroes from nottingham to portsmouth london to tamworth southampton to leeds all of these things got very definite flavors it's absolutely delicious we tasted food fit for the maharaja but sometimes the surroundings weren't quite so impressive i hope the food's good that's the deck i was shocking i feel like i'm in pete dobson's bathroom this is proper authentic indian food served inside a cafe with cafe prices the food is delicious it looks like this money has been has been here has been sitting here for ages it's absolutely disgusting [Music] after months of whittling down the nominations we finally found two outstanding restaurants [Music] kerry corner and cheltenham gave us a fantastically warm welcome nestling in the heart of the cotswolds this is one of the oldest bangladeshi restaurants in britain how are you good to see you how are you very indeed thank you what lovely place head chef samshall crowery is still going strong at 59 helped in the kitchen by his wife salaha and daughter marusha my god look at the size of the kitchen it's small it's my news so you're not the head chef are you i think if i claimed to be the head chef my head would be off so i won't even bother good very nice that's why you see everything nice which can you just leave us alone for two minutes please have a quick chat with your mom thank you talk about a proper family run friendly business incredible in the kitchen with your wife your daughter and your son in front of house he's been cooking for 42 years before i was [ __ ] born every single person in this family loves food cooks it eats it thinks about it every single moment first up for me samosas extraordinary foods you have to travel to bangladesh to get that kind of flavor and he's managed it longshan where do you go the lamb shank just slides down the bar and i mean it's cooked perfectly i haven't even tasted it yet but you can just tell [Music] it would be an absolute dream come true to win the airport's best local restaurant it would mean the world to us i'm happy we're going to win thank you for that um my problem is that this is a tough category because there are amazing indian restaurants across the country sadly the bad news is there's only two restaurants that can go through to the f-word restaurants congratulations you're one of them oh my god next time is gonna be the f-word ration for 50 diners and trust me they're tough cookies congratulations i'll see you in london definitely the right decision without a shadow of doubt this place is unique it's refined they've managed to focus on flavour gordon's expecting great things from us so we just hope we can deliver oh yes you don't know why okay [Music] so curry corner from cheltenham is through and in a group with such high standards we found a brilliant and worthy opponent la san in birmingham good to see you good to see you stunningly stylish lausanne is a city center favorite head chef akhtar islam was just 22 years old when he opened the restaurant with his best friend jabba the young guns from the midlands are determined to be different with cutting-edge cuisine for birmingham we were the pioneers we were the first restaurant to break away from the mainstream and offer alternatives to your baltis and your tikka masalas that's exquisitely presented finesse very competitive you know we're set out to be number one and hopefully one day we'll make it home chicken thank you with fried ginger what's the ambition the sand what is it it's not food for people who haven't got an educated palette it is a very sophisticated cuisine i haven't come across any indian food anyway yet with fried leeks sun dried tomatoes fried ginger that's dried in the oven i mean it's just everything that goes into the actual food itself yeah that is as authentic we're just ultimately we're trying to bring the food forward a bit so you're looking for a michigan style i'm hoping to get mission star yeah that's the plan i love his arrogance because he reminds me very similar to myself you know 15 years ago the biggest problem that you have today is that you're trying too hard the arrogance versus the confidence you've got a little bit of me in there and you know there's only two restaurants you can go through and cook in the f-word [Music] and you're one of them congratulations chef welcome thank you very much just i do want to kiss you we've done it i mean it's amazing it is probably the the biggest thing that has ever happened to any of us i definitely think i've made the right decision one hell of a cocky chef young but bloody talented [Music] so i found my top two indian restaurants well the f-word diners prefer curry corners traditional charm or lasan's ambitious modern take on indian food who'll be crowned the f word's best local indian restaurant we're about to find out now both teams are going to cook 25 portions of the starters and make sure those customers pay for your food excited yeah chef yeah okay let's go andrew stations let's get ready for starters yeah let's go we're back in london at the f word restaurant and tonight is indian night the value of the indian food market in britain is around 500 million pounds but who does it best we searched the country and found the f word's top two local indian restaurants la san in birmingham and curry corner in cheltenham okay guys first couple of tables coming in right listen listen up please don't order full covers table one four lamb samosas yes chef yes you don't have to shout for theirs but thank you anyway right curry corner listen up please focus four yes four lamb samosas yeah sure yes chef tonight both brigades are kicking off with samosas here's my recipe for this delicious indian starter [Music] chickpea samosas delicious simple and so straightforward first the filling vegetable oil not too hot don't want to burn those spices curry powder garam masala cumin turmeric [Music] fry onion in the spices seasoned cream chilli just wakes everything up garlic ginger next add chickpeas and peas water nice simmer lemon juice lightly crush cool samosa dough roll cut out take the disc and just cut it in half form a little cone fill water [Music] seal nip together nice and gently [Music] hot pan vegetable oil fry salad out chickpea mosses with salad and raita dressing done guys this is not a race okay it's a restaurant actor yes yes give me time on the first four please essan how long two minutes good man excellent both freshman's are cooking their own samosa recipes it'll be interesting to see who comes out on top la san in birmingham pride themselves on taking authentic indian cooking in an exciting and modern direction it's an old boys club and we are the new generation for their lamb samosa they marinate the meat in raw papaya paste for 24 hours to make sure it's exquisitely tender and they're using a special kind of thin biscuity pastry called nimki adding nigella seeds for an aromatic flavor the filling inside the samosa is lamb and that's spiced with the usual you know you've got chili turmeric raised it is braised but then what we do we totally evaporate all the sauce then we just pound it mix it with some mint and coriander and it's just uh put into the pastry very easy i think you'll enjoy the food yeah i hope the diners like it as well those first four hectares that sounds like now you're using a cutter for yours yeah yes okay i want to see you behind that the secret behind it is it'll just seal the pastry off yeah and also this is how it's made at home [Music] family run curry corner in cheltenham have been serving their traditional home style indian food for 32 years we've got probably 100 years worth of cooking experience between all of us our family is all about food and i don't think you can beat that for their samosa filling curry corner cooked the lamb with roast spices cinnamon cardamon bay leaves and cloves for their dough they're using a light whole wheat flour that can be rolled out into a much thinner pastry this recipe is actually my grandmother's recipe and so it's a lot more home style as opposed to any any of my cooking i mean samosa any of my cookies yes my home cooking i always follow my mom's step yeah they look fantastic away now five more please yes well done so you're quite a modern young cook thank you very much i know you when lagerlast turned up to the restaurant expecting a chicken tikka masala and a beer it does it does annoy me it's not something that you know an experience i have to enjoy very often indian food can offer so much more so why take up many space with the tiki masala right simple ass in my kitchen i'll never serve that you'll never serve a chicken chicken masala never serve chicken chicken salad if you try my masala challenge and nobody makes in uk masala do you have the best i am any chef you challenge actor any any chef yes any chef how long we've been cooking champshow 41 years 41 years how old are you hector i'm twin nine chef when was the last time you ate a chicken chicken masala um when i was putting out two last year about 12 years ago how was it uh horrible so uh i didn't like the amount of food coloring in there i thought it was totally unnatural in color do you want the shampoo to email the recipe for you uh more than welcome but it wouldn't find its way into my menu i mean i don't use any color in my restaurant what like a lovely orangey color from all the caramelization of the browning of the onions and all the rest of the masala you freshly grind the spices down in release flavors and it'll color up the curry naturally all right but um if you said it was red then i'd i'd probably say that that's fine that's well done but what i would say i mean when you mentioned the tikka masala they don't even have that practice of cooking in bangladesh did i use the tandoor apartment oh jesus you don't know nothing about bangladesh let's agree to disagree an actor is an indian snob yes okay yeah i need two totals of four from you yeah yeah and we'll go in the box okay oh my gosh now everybody loves a curry but as actor would tell us there's so much more to indian cookery than a chicken tikka masala over 6 000 indian restaurants in the uk serve 3 million happy customers a week but the vast majority of dishes they offer are either chicken or lamb thank you it's all delicious but i believe with such a limited range of meats we're missing out on a world of cunnery opportunity and to prove this i'm going to recreate a true indian classic using a piece of meat that you won't find on your average indian menu anywhere venison [Music] it's a wonderfully rich gamey ingredient that's a perfect match for highly spiced flavors i've come to scotland in search of the finest wild deer for my delicious new dish one that deserves a place on any indian menu venison masala i'm hunting with mobarak jan who regularly stalks deer up here most indian restaurants use halal meat and i'm keen to know how wild venison can be halal mo's a muslim hunter and he's going to show me how he does it what was it attracted to why why do you want to start shooting well it's mainly really sort of um the sort of hunter-gatherer kind of thing you know shooting for your own food taking it home taking some venison home and cooking it up and having beautiful food joining us is jim mccurlin who's going to help us track down a deer if you spot one and i haven't seen it just go and that's all i'll hear it yeah don't point out it don't point don't raise any hands are we ready let's go i was born ready but deer are elusive creatures and incredibly difficult to shoot and what could spook him noise scent after two hours jim spots our first deer see those tall trees up there yes he's just out he's just come out here he comes he's running along the bottom [ __ ] i still can't see him top left see him oh yeah yeah just as i'm getting ready to take the shot [Music] i lose it gordon that deer [Music] next day we set off again but the deer always seemed to be one step ahead of us finally after several hours of hard slog jim spotted a roe deer hello safety off no yeah [Applause] i follow up with the second shot he's dead yeah quite strange feeling to being with isn't it yes but when you've got it in your sights like that your heart's just beating absolutely big deep breath they call it buck fever then it's time for mo to show me how he makes sure he's dear is halal as well as saying the prayer when he pulls the trigger he slits the throat in a special way what i would do yeah to make it hello yeah you used to repeat the prayer bismuth that's it that's it one swift back and forth that's the main thing with halal the knife has to be razor sharp we do it this way to get all the blood out the carcass um just so it's nice and clean well done gordon it's the moment of truth time for me to cook my venison masala for mo and jim i'm gonna be using venison that most shot of the weekend it's been hung and chilled and more importantly he shot it so therefore is halal the first thing i'm going to do is make the most amazing dry rub mix cumin fennel seeds chili powder coriander seeds and chili flakes trying that down nice rub the spices into the meat into the pan nice cook for about four minutes basting continuously then remove from the heat and as it starts to cool down in the oil it takes on all that wonderful flavor from the spices for the masala sauce grate one onion season and add garam masala turmeric garlic and ginger we can afford to make it a little bit more spicy because it's going up against the dense rich venison add chilies chopped tomatoes and a splash of water grater whole cauliflower and add to the mix masala paste starts to absorb it finally add chopped coriander and a squeeze of lemon and there you go that's not worth six hours pissing around in the bushes i don't know what it is but i'm really keen to find out if moe likes my venison masala you like that that's gonna stop that's what i want to see that smile on your face that's good stuff what do you think of venison everyone thinks it's associated with posh dinners but i've always thought it goes quite well with the indian spices quite dense quite gamey yeah why don't they use it across indian cuisine to be honest i don't think it's available it's readily available there's another like lamb and chicken and stuff there's a new business for you yeah hello edison last table of four champs sure yes sir last table actor you've got one table two last two yeah goes out like exact same as the first two yeah huh yes last table good all right well done sure yes well done i really enjoyed the starter all the flavours worked together meat was really really tender and the coating was really nice and crispy it wasn't too spicy just a nice balanced dish really flavoursome actually i was really really impressed now how do you think he's doing tonight he's doing very well yeah as expected i just think he's not in there helping anymore no no i'll leave him to live him to it you had the curry corn samosa that's right um i'm not impressed i'm fred the approach was good it was authentic and it's how it was intended with the pastry to too heavy too thick and the filling unfortunately wasn't flavoursome or [Applause] elect salt and other other spices i got to get the kicking from you oh my

fillet bass with the bengali fish broth please lasan's fillet of sea bass in bengali fish broth is a modern indian dish derived from a traditional recipe first aktar heats mustard oil adds mustard seeds just a generous pinch and we're going to wait for that to start popping curry leaves onions and garlic and allows to sweat he then adds two whole chilis snapping them at the ends the seeds stay inside but we're trying to get the flavor because we don't want it to make it too hot aktar adds turmeric coriander and chili powder a little bit more than the coriander three times as much as the turmeric next fish heads full of intense flavor akhtar is using roy bengali carp which adds to the authenticity of this dish then he adds tomatoes coriander water and simmers after an hour the broth is strained he cooks potatoes in the broth and adds lime juice the sea bass fillets are seasoned with turmeric chili then coated in rice flour it's going to help us get skin very crispy they're fried skin side down and turned [Music] pan fried fillets of sea bass in bengali fish broth served right what's the secret behind that broth the major flavors are coming through on that is the coriander garlic and um tomato with a hint of chili or a bit of a kick looks very nice lovely i know if you don't get 15 out of 50 paying for your main course you're going to be gutting tonight come on i'm going to cry you can't let this boy beat you come on this is what curry corner have on tonight's menu curry corner's signature dish is monkfish and saffron cream curry first shampoo fry some fresh garlic and ginger he then adds salt cardamom pods cloves bay leaves and stirs in a whole crushed cinnamon stick shampoo adds onions and red peppers with tomato puree cumin turmeric coriander and chili powder measuring by eye with his 40 years of experience then he lets the flavors really infuse large fish chamsell then coats the monkfish with pepper mustard seeds fennel seeds and aguan an asian spice that tastes a lot like thyme he then fries the fish to finish the sauce sham saul heats a spoonful of his spice mix in a pan and adds cream then milk with saffron and lime leaves a chopped spring onion vine tomato and fresh coriander finally he adds his monk fish coconut milk and shredded coconut complete hmong fish and saffron cream curry served what makes that dish stand out they're very very subtle flavoring from the spices but it's a very delicate flavor octal's broth has a strong pungent kick to it yours is very delicate it's very delicate because the fish is very delicate right and all we need is something to just lift the sweetness of the fish which is the most important part each dish is looking like the first let's go hold on service please let's go right now it's time to check on janet street farmer this year i'm challenging janet street porter to raise all the meat for the competition final at the f word restaurant last week she started a farm with seven miniature dexter cattle look i'm in charge now this week i'm adding to janet's challenge with the rarest breed of pork we've ever had in the f-word kitchen the bully mangalitza to help her choose three piglets i've sent her to meet an old friend pig expert christine ko i've forgotten my wellies so i hope that i'm gonna be very wet is that a pig that is a pig looks like she's wearing a wig sure this pig hasn't got a two pair no look give her a stroke do i have to she got fleas no that's right mangalitsas were first bred in hungary in the early 19th century closely related to wild boar and with a nervous temperament to match mangalitzas produce beautiful meat with a stronger gamier flavour and as the fattiest pig in the world they're perfect for salami cured loin and bacon yeah oh it's so wary isn't it wonderful oh my god it's like pubic hair well not like any pubic hair i've seen anyway enough about the sow it's time for janet to meet her piglets this has taken just over a couple of weeks ago oh yeah it looks like it's right doesn't it yeah they're so tiny when they're born absolutely but they're straight right into the teeth so they're highly intelligent they are they they they always sift them on the bottom so that's how they recognize them oh no well i know they're going to be tasty because i've just eaten a sausage made from one of their ancestors six weeks have passed so they're ready to go to their new mum and janet's three now not so little pigs are arriving in yorkshire oh sorry before they can go into the brand new pen janet needs to give him a quick health check can i wear these yeah i'm not going to wear them because i need to be able to finish you're at one with pigs i'm on a learning curve i'll calm down now we have to try and stay very relaxed around them right look at its eyes nice clear eyes they're not runny they're not runny nose not runny not very runny no you're fine trotters try to look perfect what stinky little trotters you've got can you just have a look at the bottom to see if he's got the runs ugh how do i know just look and poke about a bit i'm not ugh nothing i'm not waiting for him to have the runs and what sex is it what we got underneath well there's a lump what does that mean have we got a knee at the back i can't tell christine i don't know what i'm looking for it's a boy how do you know it's a boy because it's got really probably not a lump that'll do i'll stand still for god's sake 11 kilos right meet you mate so that they're ready for the f word restaurant i need each pig to gain from one and a half to two kilos in weight each week the equivalent of two bags of sugar this one's much heavier but you're leaning on it it's really important to do these checks particularly after they've had a little bit of stress and a long journey just to make sure they're starting off healthy you are now the proud owner of three of the rarest pigs in the uk they look fantastic look make the neighbours janet's chosen her pigs and cows and all she needs now to complete her mixed grill is some chickens her challenge is about to get even harder fancy meeting you here i'm really good to see you now kyle's last week pigs this week yeah how are they they're fantastic they're so lively really but i picked a special breed of pig manga elixir pit do you like them yeah i like their hair oh really blonde right pubic more sort of the green two thousand gray it's like your hair but i think curly i'll ride okay i think that's why you picked this next so you're saying i've got cubes on top of my head you had trouble finding their penises as well that is the kind of thing you're obsessed with no i'm not no but i've never taken a problem journey through life i've never every time i comb their hair yes i'll be thinking of you yeah come on guys you're the best freshman to prove it yes yes tomorrow night none of you're gonna get another chance to do this again so really make it count the seafast was pan-fried to perfection it was really lovely in the broth it was absolutely perfect the sea bass was quite lively i think it was quite a modern take on indian cuisine everything together just complimented each other it was beautiful and i would definitely pay for sea bass i like very much but this is the dish i i find this too hot for me oh the monk fish is amazing the flavors really worked and and it wasn't too rich it was really beautiful the monkfish it was quite tough and i just think that the spices there was no kick to it no kick to the dish right so less and sea bass looks amazing in terms of presentation yeah it's bold but it's incredibly delicious that broth is very very rich and that wakes up the sea bass very good curry corners monkfish looks more traditional it's very delicate and i like it but it's not spicy enough that needs to be a little bit more aggressive in terms of flavor the sea bass for me the broth seals it right let's find out how you did out of 50. take an educated guess which we see no i don't know 35 35 50. actor 50. how well do you think that's the best went down i'm hoping we'll we'll be in the high 40s fingers crossed okay let's do you

versatile and once you've mastered how to cook them trust me the door then opens to a wide range of delicious options [Music] this is like a triple omelette but a lot more ingredients than a normal mess let's start off with some lovely smoked bacon slice the bacon bacon in no salt a little touch of pepper start off in a high heat get our bacon really nice and crispy otherwise you just boil the bacon and it's got that soft unpleasant texture in the potato turn down the gas and now start adding your veg roughly chop a red pepper and add it to the pan Els in the bacon take the longest so that's always got to go in first now sucker them off the peppers have been cooked now from that sort of rendered fat from the bacon and then you spring onions just Bunch them up slice them I want them on an angle so they come like little green diamonds spring onions in now for the eggs crack in the eggs for that size pan seven or eight eggs I'm gonna fill it right to the very top and more importantly when I turn this out I want it like a gateau nice and thick so slice through and seal those wonderful veg hmm I'm going to season the eggs with some Parmesan cheese be quite generous because it has a really nice saltiness [Music] fresh ground pepper and then whisk whisk up those eggs nicely [Music] then add peas to the pan and to give the dish a wonderful aromatic freshness some fragrant chopped basil I want to chop that sort of roughly because I want to see those flecks of green going in weren't looking charming and how many times have you seen a dull omelette potatoes in my mind really help encapsulate the magic of having Savory eggs cooked beautifully but with texture now just before we had the eggs we've got this beautiful little ghost cheese and it's strong and powerful so I want to slice it into little chunks and then just have it dotted around I want to discover these little pockets of creamy goat's cheese now slowly add the eggs [Music] fill that right up and get your spoon now just let all that egg go down to the bottom bring it back up to the boil and sort of clean around the sides and then some of this delicious salty creamy ghost cheese over the top yeah I want it melting like a perfect slice cheese on toast nice now from there turn the grill on for four to five minutes [Music] now just looking at that delicious take a little paring knife and just make sure it's released on the sides just take your panel ham that will hopefully release the frittata from the bottom of the pan now bought over the pan turn that gently and just Shake say a little prayer and lift off [Music] now from there on there it's there look now slice through you can see how soft and creamy that is in the center and that goat cheese are just melting almost like a little sauce inside so exciting but more importantly it's so easy to do it's got texture it's got creaminess and that for me will beat any omelette for brunch so with a stack of hot buttered toast and a steaming pot of coffee this easy potato Turns The Humble egg into the perfect dish for kicking off the weekend foreign should be a laid-back Affair and a treat so the dishes need to be easy to cook but never boring my next recipe takes the humble pancake to a whole new level of flavor and excitement soft fiery and irresistible spicy pancakes one of the secrets to good cooking is learning to use your imagination when it comes to brunches you don't have to stick to the old standbys these delicious spicy pancakes are a really great alternative but more importantly so easy to do start off by toasting your cumin dry roast basically non-stick pan just a touch of seasoning the salt helps to dry out the cumin even more and then fresh ginger slice them nice and thinly stack it back up and then just slice nice little thin slices in there and then keep that punched up shake the chili foreign the seeds will prevent things getting too hot now garlic nice now add olive oil to your toasted cumin seeds and then with the garlic ginger and chili lovely and it feels strange when you talk about garlic for breakfast but the time I spent in India everybody was eating something Savory for breakfast it was extraordinary into your bowl and set aside next the pancake filling add olive oil to a hot pan mustard seeds in now they'll start dancing the minute they hit the pan then finely slice an onion onions in a little teaspoon of turmeric sprinkle that in and I've got a color an instant change leftover potatoes just slice them smell is incredible take us in now spread the potatoes across the pan or the potatoes stained I want them sort of absorbing all that really nice turmeric actually like a sponge season those potatoes and it really helps to bring out spice beautifully Stay Ready turn off the gas and let them sit there and absorb all those flavors back to the pancake batter add plain flour to your cooled garlic chili Ginger and cumin seeds Touch of salt and pepper nothing worse than the Bland pancake one whole egg milk hold The Jug one hand and whisk the other secrets to get that really nice smooth paste but whisking that egg first and brings it together and then you're milking don't put all the milk in because then you're gonna get a lumpy pancake mix and if you put less milk in it really helps it not going Lumpy look at that milk here the secret for me is to have a nice thin mix well just teaspoon of oil that helps to bring a nice crispy Edge to the mixture now just taste that's the texture pan on the larger the pan the better it helps to create the nice thin even surface I want that mix going all the way around the pan before you put the mixture into the pan make sure you give your pancake mix a really nice stir pan it's nice and hot turn down the gas Touch of olive oil in get that nice whisk with one hand pan to the mix in one and a half ladles and then roll it around it's just really nice and thin I want to see the ginger the garlic that's what I'm looking for in there now back onto the heat it only starts to remove from the bottom of the pan and lifts itself up once it's cooked these little bubbles confirm that it's just starting to lift off the pan a little shake that releases it and then just shake it to the end and toss if you haven't got the content of tossing then use a spatula and turn it over now that's exactly what I want that nice sort of crisp edge around the side the color on the pancake is so important now roll it around just let it slide out beautifully now for the exciting part filling them take your potatoes just sort of have a really nice imaginary line and then just very carefully roll there nice and tightly tuck it underneath there put it back and roll pancakes are ready to eat but with a simple dipping sauce there'll be a real treat just mix chopped coriander with natural yogurt that's really nice cooling Asian sit down on the side for me is a great brunch delicious spicy pancakes amazing [Music] and one of my all-time favorites a dish that always creates a stir is the daddy of all brunches steak sandwiches [Music] for me the secret of a great brunch is fun and Casual fuss-free cooking and everyone helping themselves this is the ultimate steak sandwich you want the Rolls-Royce of beef it has to be fillet now season it beautifully I like to open up the top of the pepper mill to increase the size of the pepper in the steak so it gives that bit of heat nice little chunks you just roll now nicely all the way around slice the garlic in half pan nice and hot olive oil in hold the steak and just place it into the pan don't drop it at the front of the pan we're going to tilt the pan forward to cook the back of a stage dual purpose now roll it back and sear underneath next my garlic and roast that garlic time fry that time I want to hear it we're not looking for a lot of color because you're going to dry out the fillet so just one end turn it back down and stir the other ending foreign place it on top of the garlic there lift up your fillet and sit that on top of your garlic butter in take a spoon tilt the pan gently lift up and baste I've got that scented garlic thyme flavor the steak's gonna cook evenly because it's sat on a little a little bit in the oven for eight to ten minutes [Music] panel for the relish you think of a steak sandwich you think of a sort of nice heated tomato relish to make the relish finely dice a red onion three finger rule one in front two behind through and chop wow next roughly Chopper chili keeping the seeds in for extra heat start off with the olive oil into a pan onions chili [Music] generosity olive oil I want a nice sort of Rich silky relish from there bigger Tomatoes you can just use red tomatoes but these yellow and red make the perfect combination now put yourself in and then roast those Tomatoes off take a wooden spoon and just sort of break them up once the Skins blister the whole tomato just starts to release all that really nice sweet texture a little teaspoon of cherry vinegar gives that nice acidic balance the sweetness of the tomatoes turn down the gas and just let them sort of Stew perfectly now a steak sandwich will not be complete unless it had the most amazing mustard mayonnaise simply add three tablespoons of mayonnaise to 3 teaspoons of whole grain mustard [Music] I've got the radish almost down to like a really nice jam now I want to make that relish a little bit more fragrant some basil slice it through sprinkle that basil in there [Music] beautiful look at this there she is my crown jewels time to take it out smell is incredible just based one more time fill it touches quite soft in the center so it's just coming up to mid-rare let it rest the same time you cooked it it'll be nice and pink evenly throughout the steak to make my sandwich I'm going to char grill some sliced you Pata bread season it nicely just a little drizzle of olive oil I want to get that bread nice and crispy pan nice and hot bread then push it down smell is amazing that Char sort of charcoal flavor we've got those marks on the bread it's just just stops the bread from becoming soggy and look at this here it is stunning on slice it gently one beautiful slice wow pink all the way through and the beef is so soft it's almost like slicing through butter the knife do the work take a little bit of mayonnaise spread that the back of the spoon on both sides next lettuce take that beautiful slice of beef well and then relish on top of that beef and just slice the sandwich in half beautiful now that's what I call a steak sandwich trust me so the sublime sandwich for brunch and you'll put a smile on everyone's face

Follow Gordon:...",2022-11-27 22:16:02.926159, slow cooking is one of the best weapons in the chef's arsenal not only is it easy it's also an incredible way to transform meat into mouth-wateringly melting dishes mastering the art of slow cooking is something every cook should learn first up my phenomenal slow cooked beef short ribs slow cooking is a brilliant way of getting lots of extra depth and intensity into your dishes the secret is to lock in all those flavors at the start and let the ingredients do their thing as it cooks these are beef short ribs and there's basically five to six bones across there and as the short rib cooks it sticks that bone the bone implants flavor and the meat just sort of melts cooks slowly gives it that nice level intensity slice alongside the bone straight down and see that marbling that sort of disappears and disintegrates i'm cooking them in a roasting tray get it on the heat until nice and hot season these short ribs beautifully olive oil in bone on the top we'll start colouring that in [Music] it's really important to give the beef short rib a really nice sear if you didn't brown the meat off it goes in the oven and it looks like boiled meat so you really want that nice dark rich coloring just cut the garlic in half slide that down the side that's going to give that beef an amazing flavor [Music] to give body to the sauce stir in a heap teaspoon of tomato puree just hitting the bottom of the pan with that tomato puree and we call it cooking out that smell of puree otherwise it just goes in there raw and it gives this sort of tartness to the braised short ribs red wine in don't use an expensive bottle of red wine there's no need bring the wine up to the boil and reduce it this burns off the alcohol and concentrates the flavor makes a big difference when you reduce the red wine down by half because it gives that nice dark rich intensity look at my garlic that is just gonna sweeten everything up incredible stock in beef stock perfect chicken stock fine just to about an inch underneath the beef short ribs bring it up to the ball to lock in all that flavor as the beef ribs slow cook cover them so they braised from the bottom and steamed from the top into the oven two and a half hours 170 to 180 degrees in she goes great thing about slow cooking is you do most of the work in advance and then put your feet up five or ten minutes before the beef short ribs come out of the oven start your garnish this is light cured pancetta i want nice thick lardons nice big thick sticks of crispy bacon [Music] these are delicious chestnut mushrooms i'm not gonna slice them just gonna cut them in half but look at the color on those lardons now all the whites raw fat have disappeared the lardons have shrunk right down and all we've got there now is the proper bacon mushrooms in beautiful so the mushrooms get seasoned from the bacon i'm pan frying these separately to the beef so they remain crisp and have a different texture [Music] leave that to cool down now this is like christmas day for me when you unwrap that fall wait you see what's underneath it [Music] wow they smell incredible lift and place on your tray beautiful to make a fantastic rich deep sauce press the soft roasted garlic through a sieve into the cooking juices i want all that nice pureed garlic coming through there because that is going to make the most amazing flavor scrape all of that off the sieve nice then just start sieving all that lovely brazing liquor wow in that smells delicious take your sauce and just glaze do them individually they deserve that respect spoon on your bacon and your mushrooms beautiful be generous with these mushrooms i'm telling you they taste amazing flat leaf parsley all that freshness over those amazing ribs incredible never ever be embarrassed about going to your butcher and asking for cheap cuts because the results are incredible amazing beef braised short ribs with bacon and mushrooms sweetcorn fritters and yogurt dip it's brilliant to have a number of great recipes up your sleeve to rely on and let's be honest we've all got a tin of sweetcorn somewhere so i'm going to show you how to make the most amazing fritter [Music] first off the mixture take your flour sieve really important to sift the flour that stops the mixture from having any lumps in there just before you get to the end i want to put half a teaspoon of baking powder the baking powder gives the mixture some lift in and just sieve that through a touch of salt and pepper next an egg about four tablespoons of milk and give that a little whisk now just put a little drizzle of olive oil in there that helps to relax the mixture whisk that in make sure we got rid of all those lumps so that i want a nice smooth almost like a cake mixture okay next take the seeds out of a chili to lower the heat roll the chili so give it a really good shake [Music] tap them out slice in half into quarter and each quarter in half and chop through it's a really nice quick way of slicing a chili into the mixture spring onion take off that outside layer of the spring onion top and tail slice it in an angle so i've got a bit of texture running through the mixture i want that nice crunch in coriander just slice through nice and gently and get that in there next to the sweetcorn now drain it from the tin and just pat it dry so it doesn't make the mixture too wet give that a nice mix you can see now i've got two thirds ingredients and one third of the mixture to bind together that's the secret of good frittata so you're you're biting into excitement not sort of dough pan on olive oil in nice and hot get a nice big dessert spoon you know there's one nice portion in space the fritters evenly around the pan in a clockwise direction so you always know which one to turn first just with the back of your spoon sort of spread them out a little bit okay palette knife just check you're happy with the color and turn over beautiful now for the chili yogurt dressing the seed and finely chop a red chili and add to a pot of natural yogurt and then some fresh lime [Music] finish with chopped coriander coriander in and give that a nice mix up that chili just lifts it the lime gives it that nice tanginess the fritters they smell amazing and with the sauce it tastes fantastic that is such a delicious recipe using a tin of sweet corn from your cupboard amazing [Music] whatever you're cooking the secret to making great food is to ensure you're locking every last ounce of flavour in that pan and this spicy sausage rice does exactly that [Music] take these spicy sausages and pierce that skin because i want all that delicious spicy sausage meat out of this casing and you get more flavor from the sausage when you take them out the casing sausage is ready turn on the gas bread onion less acidic than a big white spanish onion and a lot more flavoursome tablespoon of olive oil a tablespoon only because i want all that fat coming out the sausages to sort of really help flavor the onions onions in and the onions go in first because you can never rush cooking an onion it's really important to sort of give them five to six minutes in the pan so you can really start to caramelize them my mouth and my pepper slice around wasting nothing i want to see that sort of little core those pips in the center no fine diced pepper the rice is going to be cooking for 20 minutes so i want the veg to sort of have texture after it's cooked peppers in a bit of garlic two nice cloves just slap down off with the shell garlic in now i want to turn up the gas get the pan nice and hot because the minute that sausage goes in everything cools down and you'll end up boiling the peppers and the onions and the garlic so heat up to maximum and then just make a well in the center in now start stirring quickly this is where you get so much more bang for your buck out of sausages because the skins off and the real flavor of that spicy italian sausage is going to come through what's great about this recipe is that you can use any type of sausage to get the flavour and the heat you want i've gone for the spicy italian but it's just as good with merguez or sweet so a teaspoon paprika in give it that really nice smoky flavor rice in and we're gonna sort of basically sear the rice we call it in the kitchen blasting the rice where we sort of soaked the rice for 30 seconds and it takes on all that flavor next white wine so the wine sort of deglazes the pan and washes all that flavor from the bottom of the pan into the rice stock in bring it up to the boil turn it down and let it simmer [Music] double stop to rice turn that gas down and let it simmer for 12 to 15 minutes and just give it the occasional stir keep an eye on it now get ready to finish it slice spring onions diced sweet juicy tomatoes and roughly chop earthy flat leaf parsley spring is in tomatoes in off with the gas really important otherwise everything becomes overcooked flat leaf parsley in but look at the volume in that pan now that is an amazing way to take spicy italian sausages to a completely different level beautiful [Music] you

make sure it's you prosecco from bristol and salvos from leeds are our top two italian contenders here's how i found them the f word viewers love italian food you nominated hundreds of italian restaurants but we can only choose two to compete in the f-word kitchen determined to find the very best we went to visit your culinary heroes serving food just like mama used to make the search took us all over britain from nottingham to twickenham lesser to leeds coventry to clapham your fingers are so delicate oh yeah it's like you're playing the piano we discovered fantastic food and in some cases an exceptional level of service there's an ad for a handyman in the ladies lou i'm blocking out his number in case it's not what it seems after months of whittling down hundreds of nominations we finally found two outstanding contenders salvos and lee's shone out how are you i'm very good thank you very much welcome to salvos like many of the best local restaurants salvos is all about family john and jip are brothers their father salva started the restaurant in 1976 and 15 years ago they inherited the business really the restaurant's about feeling welcome feeling that urge to lean back in your seat to perhaps kick your shoes off feeling that you've arrived home and that's what we're about showing our passion for southern italian food and southern italian hospitality [Music] delicious every mouthful i'm tasting i'm trying to find something negative something's wrong with it that'd give a lot of italian chef to run for the money in london trust me if we actually got through it would be fabulous i'd be really proud they're clearly passionate family run which is nice authentic simple italian cuisine done with a great delivery of flavour so i've made my decision beautiful picture there who is that that's a mum and dad in selena on the lumbolare i think your pair is going to be incredibly proud for the next round [Music] well done guys i'm just so proud i just wish my dad was here to share this moment with us because he would have been just searching so salvos from leeds will be cooking the f-word kitchen tonight and i've found the perfect restaurant to take them on prosecco is a tiny place in bristol but it's already getting a big reputation it was opened three years ago by venetian chef diego del rey and is hugely popular with the locals yeah very well so this is where you're hiding down here yeah this is my bunker you see this is my my kingdom okay now you want it now you get it while diego works his magic in the kitchen his wife heidi holds down three jobs she's a teacher by day charms the front of house by night and also is a hands-on mum i think i'm married wonder woman honestly because i don't know how she does it she's absolutely incredible first up for me ravioli in a saffron sauce he personally makes these raviolis himself yes i'm keen to try diego's risotto a staple on every italian menu but a very hard dish to get just right not easy cooking out of the kitchen that small yeah it is it's always a challenge yeah sadly the saffron sauce was very strong i went out of my way just to do something special and yeah probably i cooked it up yeah with the sauce yeah the awkward thing for me uh right now is that this is a a very difficult category and sadly there's only two restaurants that are going through to cook at the f word restaurant for 50 diners okay and you're one of them congratulations congratulations thank you very much that was one of the best risottos i've ever tasted really oh great um absolutely delicious i mean i i mean seriously delicious thank you now you've got a real test for 50 diners and i've got every confidence in you you could pull it off okay yeah that's brilliant that's brilliant congratulations that's good diego too good looking to be a chef and uh yeah thank god i'm not having lunch with my wife today should go mad for him he really deserves it the whole idea of searching the country for these unsung heroes this is why that's spot-on accurate passionate italian cooking so i found my top two italian restaurants will the f-word diners prefer prosecco's elegance or salvo's rustic charm we're about to find out hey we're going to london now salvador yes shake hands with prosecco let's go let's go may the best brigade win yes christmas that's the end of being mating now we'll fight like a proper kitchen so that last dessert leaves that hot plate don't let me down more importantly don't let yourselves down or your restaurants down good luck right enough chat it's time for the starter we're back in london at the f-word restaurant tonight we're going italian from nearly 700 nominations we found the f word's best two local italian restaurants salvos and leeds and prosecco in bristol they're going to be serving 25 portions of their own starters if the f-word diners don't like it they won't pay okay on order towers yes two spinach ravioli two poor dessert two tart yes chef thank you yeah the uh prosecco two cup of really main course two venison followed by two tarts yes so they're underway and every single plate they send out is crucial half the diners will be trying salvo starter another half proseccos i've challenged them to cook ravioli an italian classic that's incredibly difficult to get right while the brigades are preparing their own versions here's how i do it fresh pasta the secret behind a great ravioli smooth silky and absolutely delicious try the filling olive oil butter garlic spinach salt pepper nutmeg [Applause] drain chop ricotta lemon zest toasted pine nuts parmesan chill pasta dough through the machine roll super thin cut on egg yolk fold push down and squeeze all that air out fold trim now to cook the raviolis literally one and a half minutes into the boiling water sage butter hot pan olive oil butter sage lemon juice take the revenues out gently roll it round the sage butter and look delicious delicate pillows parmesan beautiful spinach ricotta and pineapple ravioli with sage butter done now i diego jeff having been selected the best two selling questions in the country i know you can get every guest out there paying for your earliest okay make it count yeah ravioli is a simple dish but it's the one that really tests a chef because any flaws are immediately obvious both rations are cooking their own recipes it'll be interesting to see who comes out on top salvos and leeds has been making pasta for 33 years their southern italian food is rustic and charming cooking's not a chore cooking's a joy salvos are keeping it simple with the spinach and ricotta ravioli they're making a type of pasta called faziletti it's hand cut and folded like a handkerchief it'll be set with a simple tomato sauce which they'll be thickening with a knob of cold butter and uh recipe originated from where well it's a southern recipe so uh so it's rustic what are you finishing it with some fresh plum tomatoes sauteed in a little bit of water let me stop it you can work and talk at the same time i'm not a woman i can only do one thing at once no but i'll have a bash you don't sound that italian you got a nice broad yorkshire accent well i am fluent in italian what would you say to somebody if they thought that he wasn't italian hi here we go here's what i'm faced with i'm faced with a sort of pretty boy ravioli from milan and a rustic ravioli from leeds but they're both very impressive pretty boy first of all i'm from venice not milan [ __ ] grumpy italian scallions jesus are you always like this no this is nothing diego's northern italian roots means his food is elegant and sophisticated might appeal to you know to not everyone but people offset so i think we're on something pretty much right a fiery venetian is taking more of a risk with his ravioli diego is using a delicate filling of crab garlic and potato he's using saffron any sauce it's an unusual taste so diego's got to get it just right what does it mean to win tonight probably like winning the champions league you know that's that i think that would be the feeling really more than this brush is not good the brush this brush you see it leaves down this this bit of this bit of plastic you see it's meant to be black one no would you mean black one black hair brush you know this one would you keep our eyes open for you i'm not going to blame the brush yeah diego a black brush is not gonna make a difference yeah yeah it is make a difference because when you find when when when one of these hair is gone inside i won't be able to see it no instead of a black brush you're gonna see it because like one one of your hair there from seeing the [ __ ] kitchen you cooking in bristol don't dare start slagging off this kitchen here let's get that right yeah okay you're right for men that cooks have a [ __ ] cubby hole you know you don't have a kitchen here you have a pallet yeah no it is a palace man i don't expect guys like you to start complaining about a [ __ ] place make sure you flat out of this kitchen i want this to be the best service of your life all four of you yes yes yes four out of four in get full plates how long do you go for the rubbers 30 seconds they're going to change the sauce oh yeah just put them in the sauce okay so you got four more rolling yes yeah 14. i smell fantastic guys yeah really really good as you can see there's so much more to italian cuisine than pizza here's one of my all-time favorite ingredients this is chef alu on the beautiful island of sicily home to one of italy's most delicious ingredients it's octopus and for some bizarre reason we're actually terrified of eating it god knows why because it tastes absolutely amazing packed full of flavor and incredibly delicious beneath these crystal clear waters are hidden some of the best tasting octopus in the world [Music] grew up here and is going to show me how to catch them i'm obsessed with octopus we've had in the restaurant for the last 10 years from a capacio to a soup to the most amazing salad everybody loves here when we are at the table the octopus we go crazy right octopus can be tricky to catch so to maximize our chances we're laying pots just off the coast the more you lay the luckier you get so there's no there's no bait or anything no muscles no [ __ ] or nothing nothing at all the octopus use the pots for shelter i've heard they love shiny objects yeah you're gonna put that coin in there so i'm hoping a few quid will increase my chances good investment good investment that's another one it would be all full of october if not i'm going to dive and get my money back fingers crossed we left our pots to do their work but later that evening enzo decided to show me another method of catching the elusive sicilian octopus we should be sleeping right now yeah we should be about that we are not right fishing this is the way his father used to catch octopus in the dead of night when they come out to feed right what's the process now we're gonna look on the bottom of the sea and as soon as we see any movement of the octopus looking for food yeah then we're gonna spill it [Music] what color are we looking for there's some color over the rocks finally we found one but as i moved in for the kill the boat hit a rock i lost my footing and the octopus disappeared i was gutted i've got so close to it i could almost taste it my favorite sicilian octopus recipe would have to wait next morning following rough weather overnight and with more bad weather forecast i knew how to get out to my pots fast there's a lot bigger swell on the water today than yesterday so here we go yeah fingers crossed 15 or 16 octopus here's the first spot there's anything in there [ __ ] nothing nothing moving the coin not even the yes there is yeah coin is in there it's the second foot second part ah [ __ ] it wasn't just the first two that are empty oh come on now you understand why they are expensive to buy octopus we've pulled all 35 pots without one octopus to cook with absolutely sweet [ __ ] oh say they want to be coke to buy you plan b yeah i think i've got plan b enzo's mate had laid some pots a few days earlier and he swore they'd be brimming with octopus but before we could reach them our luck turned from bad to worse damn this is a disaster we're caught in a huge storm so we're gonna head back to port wait to the weather drops off but the storm didn't pass in fact the weather got even worse but it was three days before the clouds cleared and i could resume my octopus hunt they're saying in town that's one of the worst storms in 40 years with the sea finally calm our chances were the best they'd ever been how long have these pots been out here they've been here uh nearly a week they will be full of octopus first one this one nothing nothing it's been the story of our lives for the past five days ends are not today that's just the beginning okay oh my god jesus we'd caught it the traditional way so i was determined to kill it the traditional way too how do we kill them yeah you buy this head you what you're going to fight inside to kill it yeah right oh finally luck was on our side thank god for that we pulled in another two including a feisty two-pounder getting my hands on these little suckers has been a real battle but i got a mouth-watering sicilian stew recipe that i knew was going to make it all worthwhile five days for that baby ready to go now i'm gonna quickly blanch it in she goes lovely add seasoning and a splash of white wine to the pan and boil for 10 minutes time to get the octopus out beautiful the base of my octopus stew is fried chilies onions and garlic [Music] octopus take off the top slice that down then the octopus is going to start absorbing all that wonderful sweet flavor mixing tomatoes olives capers anchovies parsley fish stock and a splash of olive oil simmer 35 to 40 minutes i'm serving my stew to enzo's sicilian family a popular sicilian they're a tough mob and if they don't like it i might just wake up with a horse's head in my bed here we go [Music] i like you very very much very very good fantastic good tough five days however we made it it was worth it it was worth the test this is delicious katie price is tonight's recipe challenger so she doesn't get to vote but i got my team to prepare both starter recipes for her to try kd nice to meet donnie looking great enjoying your food lovely absolutely lovely you're trying to decide which one i prefer the first or the second yep i'm just have to pick which one would you prefer the crab one the crab with the saffron not too strong no lovely interesting good and favorite italian what would it be do you have a local in brighton uh donatellos always busy and now they've got so many different varieties of pasta and just different dishes is it the pasta the soups the taglitelli the ravioli i like taco telly carbonara with peas my extra peas mushrooms and more cream something you cook at home uh i've never tried it ready no no you're here for the rest of the challenge excited i am actually you could beat me well come on a silly question did you steal this recipe from mum when i was younger i also used to look forward to saturday nights watching murder she wrote blind date with my chicken care of sweet corn and chips chicken kiev sweet corn and chips fantastic really good to see you can't wait to see in the kitchen with a challenge excellent enjoy your dinner so last table chip yeah make sure that last table goes out chris like the first hair will you got the palms down there ready to go yeah maybe a few more scrapings italian cuisine that is best yeah one southern one northern i can't wait to hear the feedback from the customers yeah that means it's gonna be a close contest i'll tell you absolutely fantastic really good jeff chris well done adam diego well done i thought the uh spinach pasta was lovely the sauce was really lovely buttery but light i enjoyed it yeah i'll be paying for it it was quite nice all the ingredients and everything was very nice um i just thought the pasta was a bit undercooked how are the raviolis yes they're very nice they're very nice and that was salads yeah sort of talking straight right yeah kind of thing you could see um no no no something a little bit more refined not refined diego's would be a cleaner presentation are you going to pay for your starter i am going to pay for my starter glad to hear it good to see you thank you see you later thank you i thought the the flavor was fantastic overall it was a it was quite quite a tasty dish i felt it was slightly under seasoned it was lacking some taste in there for me personally no i won't be paying for the start today did you enjoy the starter yes it was fine i think what it did is it it just clarified the difference between northern italy in southern island southern italy it's all about letting the flavors talk to themselves northern italian a little bit dare i say a little bit fancy a little bit a little bit richer flavors and different style very very different now the most important question are you gonna pay for it no no wow are you gonna pay for yours i'm not gonna pay for mine hold on a minute you both liked it but you're not gonna pay for it it's just not of the i mean i'm being polite it's just not a good enough monitor enjoy your main course good to see you thank you my darling so one wife is paying for the opposition starter and the other isn't right i couldn't wait to try these and see what they're made of pasta's slightly bit thick there from salvos really good flavor sauce not too heavy in terms of flavor rustic and somewhat charming now proseccos we've got to try that pasta nice and thin pasta's cooked perfectly sauce vibrant got that wow factor the unfortunate thing is inside ravioli is slightly bland you could do a touch more seasoning what a shame i like both dishes but some diners have found a lot to criticize i really don't know what the result will be okay jb please right okay here we go thank you okay let's start off with salva the number of customers that are happy to pay for your starter tonight is 19 out of 25. well done congratulations thank you so um jb these six customers that didn't pay for their starter why um memories in the past i was too thick did you both roll the pasta uh i rolled it so it may i called perhaps i didn't get one or two lines yeah however 19 out of 25 well done okay prosecco for your starter out of 25 starters the amount willing to pay for your starter is 15 out of 25. hey rosetta what happened um the the crab meat was on the season so a slightly bland filling yeah i should have put more simple a bit of bit of salt and pepper would have just made uh made it better okay you still got your signature dish to cook and you can pull it back for the main okay okay head up okay salvos you're in the lead yeah long way to go now think of it this way you've got 50 portions of your main course to go yeah pull it back guys yeah good luck welcome back to the f-word now both restaurants are going to be cooking one of their favorite italian dishes for their wood diners first up is salvos [Music] check on one pork chop seven the recipe for salvos pork dish my ali al alchetto is one of chip's favorite dishes pork is my favorite meat and it is in fact it's the king of meads first he cuts three medallions and pounds them into scallops next he chops fresh mint crushes a garlic clove and adds white balsamic vinegar then stirs in grilled courgettes i can smell the garlic it's just releasing its flavor just with the heat of that and places in a hot oven to soften further chip blackens then peels these peppers then coats of scallops in flour and shallow fries i'm putting the peppers in and the kerpers he then adds parsley garlic thyme and vinegar then some sugar vital to balance the acidity now that the vinegar has done its work a little bit of white wine a bit of stuff which i've got here the [ __ ] finishes the sauce with a knob of butter [Music] here with my allied table five table five coming up with my alley porky scallops with sweet and sour peppers served why did you choose this dish it's got a lot of southern roots to it and uh are you putting color on the pork or you're just lightly searing it and no just put it a little colour a little colour on the port but it doesn't want to be too hard it's yeah it's a softer scallops yeah good there you go your venison dish you're using the loin cook so quickly uh yes now prosecco we're gonna have to pull out all the stops for the main course because they're four points behind but has he got a winning dish in that venison [Music] check on one venison special prosecco signature dish is a venison fillet with polenta and pancetta first diego says a venison it then flambes with gin diego then roast it in an oven for six to eight minutes next polenta in italian homes this is traditionally cooked slowly but in a busy kitchen diego uses a quick cooked polenta just as delicious but cooked in minutes not hours my grandmother would be horrified if i were using something like this it's like betrayal next diego fries onions carrots and celery then add crushed juniper berries which complement the gin beautifully they will give a nice gin kind of edge to your meat diego adds a bay leaf and some rosemary then pours on a glass of red wine letting it reduce before adding venison stock finally the pan fries pancetta adds blanched cabbage and crumbles in chestnuts you have salt peppermint there's a bit of sweetness and funny stuff with the chest [Music] venison fillet with polenta and pancetta [Music] served you running the venison through the oven or not yeah yeah i'll give it a pass in the oven yeah a bit of gin juniper flavor to the meat good why did you choose your venison dish why because you represent uh represents something from the mountain it's something everybody eats in my region you happy with that yeah come on do you talk to me yes indeed i'm just looking at each one four more by now yes well done yeah keep them all looking like that yes indeed sauce and everything thank you right now yeah you're ready there so we make it we make it very angle yeah good and you like the plenty runny oh yeah i like it you know i like it i like it too sauce with it yeah service please diego they look fantastic and it smells delicious thank you thank you thank you so much for okay it's not a watching not a race actually a race but it's important to win yeah very very close okay 19 to 15. what four in it your wife yeah heidi yeah agreed to pay yes for their dish yes yeah jim's wife that's the bonus didn't agree to pay for your dish now you can get it i wonder why yeah jim yes did you know that your wife and your brother refused to pay for diego starter i didn't know that no you didn't know that diego's wife yes paid for yours she thought yours was delicious ah yeah keep the energy the energy is there just you know let me use it for cooking yeah not for conversation just watching your plate i had the pork is really nice and tender and i really like the mash with the kind of crispy red peppers the courgettes were lovely with the mint and butter that was great but the overriding taste was on vinegar and i've elected not to pay for this dish i wouldn't pay for that there was a lot of flavors too many flavors for me all a little bit mixed up all a little bit too much the venison is beautiful and i really really like the i think it's chestnuts and the pancetta is really nice this blows the pork out the water to be honest it's a beautiful piece of meat it's very well seasoned and excellently cooked i'm not gonna pay for the venison on the basis that i didn't think it was cooked how it should have been cuts right the pork dish from salvos with crushed new potatoes port's cooked perfectly moist incredibly flavoursome nice little sear courgettes they managed to make a boring courgette into something quite tasty that is delicious however the sad news is the sauce is just a little bit too acidic a little bit too strong for the pork the venison dish simple presentation how's the venison cooked first off slice it in the middle yeah look at that perfectly cooked well that is harmony absolutely spot-on damn such a shame that's just a little bit too acidic now time to get the diners verdict all right well done seriously well done how do you feel uh excited looking forward to the results probably one of the most intense services i ever done all four of you yeah exceptionally well thank you chef and both dishes that phenomenal right let's find out how you did uh jb please yes okay salvo for your main course those that were happy to pay out of 50 34 out of 50. well done okay the 16 that didn't want to play where's the feedback the main reason is too many 34 out of 50. well done okay thank you right prosecco where's that hang on this one the amount of customers out of 50 that are happy to pay for your venison 40 out of 50. congratulations [Applause] what was the feedback on the 10 that i didn't want to pay what was it not enough sauce not enough sauce i'm not very keen on the pudental i mean how can you complain about hey totals so far salvo your restaurant scores 53 out of 75. prosecco your restaurant scores 55 out of 75. yeah you're now in front that is tight very very tight and it all comes down to desserts clear down get ready for the dessert well done guys really well done come on prosecco right janet's back and she's not just brewing one animal this time she's wearing the whole mixed grill last year janet became a farmer for the first time rearing two veal calves ah stop gumming me now i'm challenging her to raise all the meat for the serious finale in the f word restaurant in total should be raising over 30 animals it's going to be a huge challenge first up i've sent janet to juice some castle to provide me with some top-notch beef and dairy but not just any cattle i've selected dexter's a miniature irish breed which when fully grown are still only half the size of a normal cow penny hodgson is one of the uk's top dexter farmers and should we give janet help and advice on the breed shetland pony turns into a cow mike just find that you fall in love with them janet will be taking away two pint-sized milkers get off both come with calves the only thing when you're milking shortness dexters is the fact you have to bend quite a long way a good milking cow should have a healthy udder and a plattered nature ow ow naughty girl i'm so sorry [ __ ] thing just kicked me in the leg she is feeding two calves and she might just think that somebody else is sneaking in and trying to get a little bit of milk that was just a real one off she is i would say one of the most plastic girls in the whole herd here [Laughter] did you see that placid woman just headbutted another animal i like a bit of spirit so i'm going to choose her next i wanted to pick a couple of male dexter's called stairs for beef i've asked janet to choose dexter's with good frames long backs and the beginnings of fatty pads on their rums that will fill out and give superb dark richy marbled meat are you a bit of a golden yeti yes you are golden aren't you how many animals is that all together in you will have seven little dexters the seven cows are happily loaded up for their journey to the new home it's the eighth cow i'm worried about as far as i'm concerned i didn't sign up to get kicked and you know knocked about by them and i think there's too many of them but if anyone can keep this unruly bunch in check janet can i'm your new mum yeah [Music] look i'm in charge now so get over it good to see you my darling um you look great no it's always good to be nice to me early on starts off that way yeah and then it goes horribly well i've always been taught to respect my elders it's really good to see the pressure in the kitchen is bigger than ever yeah but you put me under so much pressure did you choose the decks just because they're so very very small just to wind me up no no they're very small you're a giant and they're going to know who's bust from day one well they did kick me it's

on the clock please right we'll shallow fry the cauliflower pan nice and clean hot pan for the bang bang sauce okay get that up to temperature don't put any oil in there yet i don't want to burn the oil okay a flower hold the cauliflower down lift your knife up and just go around the stalk and what happens look these little florets come off okay and they're like these beautiful little flowers and the stalks don't throw away great for soups now once you've got all these wonderful florets okay lightly season them don't worry if they break up a little bit but it's just so flavoursome and that's where the idea of this sort of dish comes from i started making this with chicken bang bang chicken bang bang pork but with cauliflower so tasty in here i've got some rice flour salt some pepper no chilli in there yet just a nice dust of salt and a nice dusting of pepper in there in go your florets okay and what we want to do now is just mix up those florets the rice flour gives it that really nice sort of coating and it helps get the cauliflower really nice and crispy okay so just dredge the cauliflower in there for a little bit okay now i'm gonna use sesame oil and olive oil okay and it's almost like a sort of it's gonna be like a shallow fry not deep fried there's a big difference sesame oil in and then some olive oil in okay and just bring that up to temp don't go crazy on the temperature if it becomes too hot move the pan over and just let it cool down okay now watch what happens when i drop these in we get this really nice crispy shell in okay bearing in mind every time you go into that pan you're bringing the temperature down so be careful okay use the heat accordingly now roll that around flood the pan with too much in there you turn the cauliflower really soggy okay so be smart now gauge the heat look at the color listen to the noise turn the heat up a little bit because the cauliflower has brought the temperature oil down now for that bang bang sauce okay i'm going to start off with some beautiful fresh ginger and onion you'll sweat that off first to slice the onion in half take off the root and then literally get some texture in that sauce down and slice in pans on we don't need to color the onion we need to sort of melt the onion okay so in olive oil in just a touch we want to melt this okay up with the gas and onion in from there want some freshness beautiful ginger give that a nice little saute pan down please oscar look what's happening to that beautiful rice flour starting to coat it's like this nice little blanket that gets crispy on the outside touch of salt in this bang bang sauce fresh ginger just slice it down i like it quite chunky because i wanna i wanna i wanna feel that flavor i want to sort of almost you know get excited about the freshness when you crunch that ginger you know in your teeth it sort of it lifts up your teeth and it's like the sort of the perfect cleanser because it makes your breath fresh and it is so fragrant fresh ginger in chopped almost like little battens ginger goes in now i'm going to start with the heat okay in goes the chili look at my cauliflower two pans rolling now this is the difference between shallow frying and deep frying okay i'm keeping the heat in the pan i'm keeping these little floats of cauliflower nice and sort of separate so they don't stick together but look at the color of them sauce is working beautifully what we're doing now is melting down that onion and that beautiful ginger from there this is where it starts to go up a level a little bit of a hot sauce in next a little touch of garlic don't go crazy in the garlic slice little blades in and flake that over i want the sort of sweetness but not caramelized once that hot sauce starts taking place after that a little bit of sweet chili sauce in there now look what's happened to that sauce and then my maple syrup and that starts to come together by this rich bang bang beautiful sauce now turn that gas off and let that sit there but get your lime roll that round and just hit that bang bang sauce with some fresh lime that's going to lift that together onions are melting the garlic is apparent and that ginger is giving it that nice fragrance now cauliflower look i've got the color on the cauliflower how do i make that just a little bit more vibrant i'm loving the color okay it needs something green so i just take a beautiful bok choy i've cleaned it under the water i go through the top once through the side once and then back to the top again scrunch it up and look all i'm doing now we call it like a little sort of chiffonade and it's just thin nice slices of bok choy and that gives it a little bit of freshness across that cauliflower stalks as well nice in open that up i'm going to drop that in to my cauliflower okay give that a nice toss now i love it quite hot you saw in the hot ones i can take a lot of heat now get your chili seeds in but i want this to be sort of almost like a raw chili because it goes in at the end okay chilli in and now look you can see while there's hardly any oil in there we've now got that collar on that cauliflower everything is so vibrant and then literally gas off sauce is set and i'm going to just finish this now with my lime and then look hit that that smells incredible look at the colour that comes out look you can see how that cauliflower is toasted and when i say toasted i mean it's sort of shallow fried but crispy that bok choy gives it the lift and the chili is thrown in literally second before it comes out and that bak choy [Music] brings it together before i serve i get my sauce i'm just going to literally drizzle that around i like to go on the outside so don't make all the center soggy and then finally coriander sliced once

Pre-order your copy of Ramsay in 10 here...",2022-11-27 22:16:02.926159, my take on classic chocolate brownies is guaranteed to put a smile on anyone's face and not just when they're fresh out of the oven blondies stock up in these delicious blondies they'll keep for up to a week and it's a great way of getting ahead of your expecting guests round first off melt the butter for the mixture we've had hundreds and hundreds of brownies the sort of white chocolate version i.e blondies are amazing a little bit more subtle keep a little knob of butter for the end just to grease your baking tray turn the gas down and gently melt that butter caster sugar into the bowl [Music] just give that butter a little whisk sort of makes the mixture a little bit lighter slightly fluffy off with the gas a pinch of salt in the sugar then make it a little wet in the middle and sort of whisk you can see it's already gone nice and blonde love it give that a really good mix and the secret with the butter be slightly warm sort of it melts the sugar nice and smooth lovely a teaspoon of vanilla extract in next lightly whisk in two whole eggs just give them a little beat this is such a delicious recipe yet so simple whisk in the eggs looking for that nice sort of rich textured smooth paste you can see why we call these blondies beautiful next teaspoon of baking powder baking powder in then half a teaspoon of baking soda that aerates the mixture and gives it that little tartness you'll see this sort of rise instantly the minute they hit the oven and then your flour whisk with one hand and just slowly add half the flour first get that all mixed up make sure that mixture is really nice and smooth check it occasionally no lumps half flour in and then the other half in you'll feel it sort of almost nice and firm and that's why it's so important to add the flour in stages it stops the mixture going lumpy it should be just dropping off the whisk beautiful change over from a whisk to a spoon next i want some texture some nice sweet chewiness to the blondies dried cranberries they bake beautifully but it gives the blondie a really nice sort of chewy sweetness in the center next a white chocolate [Music] i'm not going to grate it i'm going to chop it up just slice it like little bits of shrapnel i want the chocolate like little matchsticks dotted around now chocolate in lovely fold that in i want a nice even distribution of those wonderful dried cranberries don't over mix it i want to break up that chocolate nice even mix of cranberries and chocolate you can see the chocolate there'll be parts of the chocolate in the oven that will actually melt it'll be like little pools of white melted chocolate in the center now a baking tray small little knob of butter and the grease baking tray and line it some greaseproof paper and just over extend it shiny side out dull side hits the bottom of the tray in greaseproof allows me to maximize on the white chocolate inside the mix no greaseproof paper the chocolate can melt and almost stick to the tray so the paper is just a really nice insurance policy secondly we want that rise and that sort of crispness now with the mix get your spatula all the way around i don't want to see anything left in that bowl position the bowl over your tray nice and carefully loudly don't leave that slice in the bowl nobody's licking that one and then just take the back of the spatula go into the corners push and come back into the middle turn the tray around let it work to your advantage try and get it evenly positioned in the tray if it goes in even it cooks evenly make sure you smooth out the top of the blondie with the back of the spatula and then into the oven it's going to rise nice and crisp all that soft gooeyness in the center bake your blondies at 180 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes that smells incredible it's got that crisp edge on the outside and that sort of soft gooey center leave that to cool down and it's going to sort of firm up and wrinkle but it'll stay nice and gooey in the center once it's cooled down take it out and start slicing [Music] your mouthwatching blonde is a fantastic easy treat to have on hand for yourself or to share my next recipe is a time-honored british classic but with addition of spices it's given a new lease of life fragrant spiced rice pudding i love cooking with spices but you don't have to just cook savory dishes using aromatics and spices across desserts takes your puddings to a completely different level [Music] first off our spices this is a fresh vanilla pod fragrant and packed full of flavor use the back of the knife and flatten it that removes all those little seeds off the skin of the vanilla pod take your knife slice down the middle and then when you open that up the smell is incredible take the tip of the knife and you scrape inside and look all those seeds dying to come out that is incredible there are thousands of seeds still ingrained to the pod so put them in to the casserole cardamom powerful spicy take two little pods place your knife on top and lightly crack them cracking the cardamom pods helps release all the amazing flavour cloves gives it that kind of aniseed flavour with a lot of depth one two three cinnamon stick snap and in [Music] just smelling that level of fragrance you can imagine what the rice pudding's gonna taste off turn on the heat lightly toast those spices just a couple of seconds now what's gonna happen is just gonna sort of enhance those spices in a way that it just draws out an even more powerful fragrance coconut milk in sugar two tablespoons milk and then a couple of tablespoons of cream bring it slowly to the boil to allow the flavours to infuse and this rice pudding reminds me of my time in india where i got really into that chai tea fragrance because it was just so delicious and so comforting take a lime in the lime just cuts through the richness of the coconut gives it that nice little bit of acidity goes fantastically well with the cinnamon and that fresh vanilla nice have a taste now let's come up to the boil give it a nice little clean around the outside and in with the rice use 200 grams of pudding rice don't wash it beforehand because the starch helps thicken the rice pudding in the oven and just turn that down to a light simmer and the pudding rice starts to open up and it absorbs all that coconut vanilla cardamom clove and cinnamon bring up to the ball gently and cook it out three to five minutes boiling it rapidly the rice opens up and it goes into mush we want to keep that nice texture that sort of fragrant rice pudding on a gentle simmer next a little luxury i want to show you how i take this simple delicious aromatic rice pudding to a completely different level here's what i do take two egg yolks separate them now give that a really nice whisk two nice tablespoons of mascarpone cheese whisk that into the egg yolks just so it's nice and smooth it's almost like finishing the rice pudding in a delicious custard turn off the gas add that into the rice pudding what happens it starts to enrich and really thicken this rice pudding and takes it to a completely different level the rice is still not cooked it's starting to go nice and soft you can just see how it's opening up but looks like rich aromatic lava bubbling away finally great more citrus zest the lime on top roasted caramelized lime zest on top of rice pudding is phenomenal then put it in the oven for 15 minutes at 200 degrees to finish cooking the rice and develop the intensely aromatic flavours look at that an incredibly fragrant rice pudding how beautiful does that look spicy are a brilliant way of helping classic dishes come alive i'll guarantee you'll never ever have had a rice pudding like this before my next recipe is a proper british classic that's super simple to cook and cost next to nothing a delicious apple crumble crumbles are the perfect way to use fruit when it's in season there's lots of it about it's nice and cheap but most importantly the fruit's at its absolute best first off i'm gonna make a really nice light caramel pan on nice and low great two apples [Music] and this helps to almost sort of pure the apple so much quicker there's a lot of flavor in the skin so don't worry about peeling the fruit whether it's pears plums peaches flavors in the skin nice to start the caramel a couple of tablespoons of sugar the sugar helps to get rid of the tartness in the apple a touch of cinnamon that starts to make it a little spicy open up your vanilla just scrape out all those seeds now this just makes it light and fragrant all those seeds in to the sugar when making caramel be patient and always swirl the dish instead of stirring it when the sugar goes brown add the apple that starts to sort of cool down the caramel but it gives it a really nice sort of caramelised puree apple's almost disintegrating smells incredible turn the gas down slice up two apples it's a crumble that's got no frills straight forward no faffing around no peening of the skin i want them to sort of stand out from the caramel apples in now those nice thick chunks of apple sort of almost bedding itself into the puree dried cranberries gives it that nice sort of shock in the texture sweet and chewy i want it to sort of taste zesty spicy so sit the lemon zest on top of your apples and cranberry fresh lemon juice over and that just gives that extra acidic kick takes the cranberries the apples the caramel and the cinnamon to another level turn the gas off just let that sit let's concentrate on the crumble flour in a couple of tablespoons of demerara sugar sugar helps to get the topping nice and crispy butter in give that a nice little rub what we're looking for is like a a bread crumb mixture lightly season it with a touch of cinnamon and the demerara sugar sort of helps to get a nice fine crumble mix and it stops the butter from sort of melting in that flour so that's the basic crumble mix but i'm not finished yet muesli two-thirds crumble one-third muesli mix that in if you haven't got muesli then crunchy granola works brilliantly too lovely now start off in the center and work your way around i want the crispiness on the top the puree on the bottom of the caramel and then the texture in the center a good tip turn the gas back on i want it bubbling before it goes in the oven because then you just gotta cook the top so as soon as you see that caramel starting to bubble down the side in she goes let's go bake at 200 degrees celsius for 12 to 14 minutes until golden brown smells amazing [Music] beautiful still bubbling [Music] and look at it a delicious but very simple crumble with apples at the absolute best beautiful [Music] you

go-to that's why i'm putting a delicious new spin on a japanese classic adding some delicious healthy tuna to a traditional katsu sandwich trust me the minute you bite into this every bite will leave you wanting more right ingredients oscar pan down first of all tuna now traditionally sandwiches normally serve with either chicken or pork but today we're going healthy tuna steak from there some beautiful panko breadcrumbs flour egg that's a classic dredge okay in terms of when you panny something granny smith apple to give it a little bit more zest cabbage to give that nice little bit of crunch and texture a little bit of ginger tonkatsu sauce classic with ketchup worcester sauce soy sauce and such a mirin now sesame seeds additional if you wish touch a chili if you wish but simple and delicious right let's have 10 minutes on the clock now nonstick pan clearly because we do not want that beautiful tuna stick in right get the pan on now lightly season this tuna first okay really important it's a very dense protein super delicious but really really important that we season it okay before we flour egg wash breadcrumb i'd also like a little bit of a sort of chef treat i like to season the tuna with some lemon now lemon or lime zest it doesn't matter but look put that in there okay and now the three stages okay take your egg crack that onto a nice flat surface give that a little mix i like to use whole egg okay which makes it a lot more sort of thicker sometimes you can put water or splash of milk in there but i like it nice and sort of thick therefore it keeps in the flavor and doesn't allow my tuna to go watery again just a touch of seasoning in there so step one okay flour egg bread crumbs get your tuna roll it round that beautiful seasoned lemon zest salt pepper already it smells very fragrant into the flour okay roll around the sides really important really important into the hands and clap clap clap okay we're just shaking off the excess flour from there into the egg okay lay it down flip it over roll the sides and then back down look all that lemon's still stuck in there and then into your bread crumbs wipe your hands and then from there look this is the magical bit flip that up and just just get your crumbs over there first before you touch it that way you don't have these big thick fingers now look in and what i like to do now is just get it and sort of pack it in there okay push those breadcrumbs down and that forms a really nice crust and that's texture there roll around the sides i know i sound slightly annoying but roll it around the sides it protects the tuna okay flip it over pat it down now pan now pan oil in get this really nice and crispy okay really important get it up hot just slightly smoking and in shake off the excess bread so it doesn't burn in the pan and then literally lay away from you okay get that nice crisp sear really important now the secret here is we're serving the tuna nice and rare okay check that color just lift it up and look back onto the heat really important that we don't burn these breadcrumbs i want that nice light golden texture on there okay flip tilt the pan it cooks the back of the tuna okay literally 30 seconds each side and then look i'm going to turn that back over and look at that beautifully done as it sits there it's cooking nicely i'm a stickle for seasoning fish and finish them always with a bit of citrus okay now from there little touch of olive oil in there again okay roll it round and just tilt that down and make sure you turn clockwise the tuna and cook the back of that steak okay i want it nice and pink in the middle i'm gonna turn the gas down okay but as that comes out i want to just literally hit that with a little touch of chili just a touch on there tuna is very dense very sweet and a little bit of chili in there just lifts that flavor up time please okay now the slaw i say slaw but it's almost like a sort of a delicious sort of nice fresh slaw take your cabbage and literally just grate okay the secret behind this is to make sure we got that really nice fresh crunch to this sandwich okay slow in don't worry about those outside leaves just check again i'm going to turn this one more time over look at that that's the color i want that nice golden brown color okay seems crazy i wanted i want the fish to rest a little bit okay so i'm gonna take out the pan and let that rest cabbage nicely done we'll change up the texture a little bit of granny smith apple time please excellent granny smith apple cabbage trust me hey marriage made in heaven again you've got red apples it doesn't matter the flavor of the cabbage and apple is delicious right tuna can come out now and literally rest okay but look at that color so beautiful let that rest as that rest fresh lemon juice just on the top and just let that permeate and go all the way through lemon juice inside the slaw some fresh ginger squeeze out that excess juice and just slice that up okay mix that in with the cabbage and the apple now think of the flavors going on there okay you've got beautiful salt pepper chili and then give that a nice little stir now that is so fresh now look it's starting to build those flavors tonkatsu sauce starts off with the ketchup time please two tablespoons of delicious ketchup a nice healthy lug of soy sauce mirin in tablespoon and then some peppery beautiful nice worcestershire sauce in she goes now from there give that a really nice stir okay now think about the texture okay got a nice spicy ketchup we've got the tuna set there and this is how we start the build take your beautiful bread and now slice that down now this sandwich as you know traditionally is normally served with beautifully pulled pork or fried chicken keep that size nice and thick and this is where the magic starts now from there get your sauce okay and layer that sauce on time please three minutes to go now generous on this sauce cover that bread okay and then from there the smell is incredible okay i'm gonna get a little bit more zest on there to make that sauce very tangy you'll see why in a minute beautiful done now with your slaw on she goes cover that bread this is so fresh and fragrant you only need to put that beautiful cabbage and apple and chili on one side now cover the corners we don't want any cheap sandwiches here and then look the flavor is amazing the ginger inside that slaw just lifts it on she goes over the top and then do you go into triangles or do you go straight down i'm from a council

Pre-order...",2022-11-26 22:16:02.926159, now oxtail was something that we grew up with yeah there's something you can do in the morning and put it in the oven because it has to be cooked really really slow yes i'm gonna dust this in flour it's amazing how many chefs are using oxtail on their menus today it's incredible it's very popular it's very cheap as well it's amazing i used to make it stretch for like five or six dinners oh don't exactly it's not that bad now i know why we're all so skinny growing up it wasn't that bad i'm joking come on you know i'm joking but you see sometimes we went to the butchers and you had maybe extra two or three i used to put in a saucepan and you had lovely stock for soup what was that spicy soup the really nice tony and i used to make the good pot of scotch broth scotch broth i remember now i'll peel a couple of cloves of garlic i'll show you a quick word getting that out get your knife and just brush it peel them and i'll crush them in the garlic crusher okay all right all right oxtail in i'm gonna fry that off we can get that nice and brown and we've all braised it in red wine and sort of chicken stock before but i'm gonna get this done with a chinese influence the chinese absolutely love cooking oxtail you started cooking at home quite early on right 17 and a half 17 and a half your mum died quite young very young 26 26 so who taught you how to cook nobody taught you i think you just learn as you get older and you learn by your mistakes and did you enjoy it i did enjoy it yeah that was a nice vegetable the fennel panel isn't it that lovely it's beautiful yeah a lot of people don't use it a lot of them use it in salads but no one actually cooks it you just slice that up them now these are nice and brown and they look lovely put the color on there you just slice up the chili okay just slice it down and keep the seeds in there because i want some heat as well yeah i wouldn't have thought i'd put that in there no no one thing you never used to do was work with many spices there wasn't many chinese influences i wasn't very adventurous with spices like me no i like ginger do you i love ginger especially fresh yeah coriander seeds a little handful tim yeah some soy sauce and quite generous in soy sauce four or five tablespoons that helps give it that saltiness and a nice dark rich color on the vegetables so as it raises the meat tenderizes quicker i would never drink fennel and the chilis and that but it smells lovely does that smell nice and then a little bit of this this is a what's up a rice wine vinegar is it yeah what other tips would you give me in order to save money on cooking what got you through that tough time feeding all six of us and holding two jobs when that was in the oven sea for about an hour and a half then i would think right i'll make a roast pudding i put an apple pie and for the same sort of heat use the other shelf in the oven so you weren't just watching the pennies in terms of the produce you're also cutting down the gas bill yeah wow super nab yes yeah so oxtail back on top of the vegetables gonna top that up is that beef stock yeah this is uh no a really nice chicken stock why are you putting chicken stock in it because it's quite a sort of light fragrant way of cooking oxtail because oxtail itself is quite rich yeah chicken stock's nice and light just cover it with stock lovely colorism a beautiful color little taste there we go big deep breath okay then well that's lovely i can taste the fennel in that is that nice that's lovely oh jesus damn water for nan [Laughter] take some watermelon no water is it water come on while mum recovers from the kick off the chili to go with my oriental influenced oxtail i'm going to knock up a quick fresh radish salad take a bunch of radishes and separate off the edible leaves once washed thoroughly place half the radishes in the bowl with the leaves chop the remaining radishes in half and add them too [Music] next peel and finally slice a banana shallot add them to the radishes and season with salt and pepper dress with a good squeeze of fresh lemon juice and a drizzle of olive oil then mix radish salad it's that simple next up dessert delicious poached pears i love pears ready so we're gonna poach them with a little bit of chili chili i've never heard of that a little bit of saffron no no no pan on take off a little slice like that so they stand up nicely and then peel okay then and then the chilli you hold that up and just go down yep through and open that up okay into the water seeds in as well a little bit of chili water and sugar what are they holes saffron is expensive but you only need the tiniest little bit a little pinch to make that water go light and golden star in these how comes the chinese you've like sliced it at the end and it's not put in whole i want all that flavor coming out of the chili we're going to make the most amazing star in east dust sorry stars dust should you get your star nice in there seed up and then in see all those little seeds yeah and then you start grinding a little teaspoon of ginger give it a nice mix thank you meg and that's going to dust the top of the pears once they're cooked right get your pears drop them in there [Music] and that's what we're going to sprinkle mmm ginger and sternies the rice is that you're very good that's lovely isn't it so once they're cooked cool down sprinkle that over the top right have you guys got homework yes see you guys come back shortly thank you turn that down and let them fall okay bye thank you guys after an eight minute simmer our pears should be ready now just get your knife on put the knife through and see how easy the knife is so that means they're soft and cooked now you can leave them in that overnight two or three days all right and they just get darker and more beautiful the good thing about the cooking liquor is that you don't throw that away because you can use that again for re-poaching beautiful i mean they look impressive they smell delicious don't they [Music] look at the colors nice lovely isn't it because they're amazing and just smells delicious and then take your little star and east dust and just dust over look at that nice lovely now for my favorite part the oxtail wow look at that is beautiful hmm i'm just melts in your mouth doesn't it i love the way you see that just sliding down the bone there's no waste in that at would you all that to the table please then yes lovely and i will grab that that is beautiful [Music] this is my ultimate thrifty dinner sumptuous slow-cooked chinese braised oxtail with a light and peppery radish salad followed by gorgeous chilli poached pears with star and east dust whatever you're cooking the secret to making great food is to ensure you're locking every last ounce of flavour in that pan and this spicy sausage rice does exactly that [Music] take these spicy sausages and pierce that skin because i want all that delicious spicy sausage meat out of this casing and you get more flavor from the sausage when you take them out the casing sausage is ready turn on the gas bread onion less acidic than a big white spanish onion and a lot more flavoursome tablespoon of olive oil a tablespoon only because i want all that fat coming out the sausages to sort of really help flavor the onions onions in and the onions go in first because you can never rush cooking an onion it's really important to sort of give them five to six minutes in the pan so you can really start to caramelize them mouth and my pepper slice around wasting nothing i want to see that sort of little core those pips in the center no fine diced pepper the rice is going to be cooking for 20 minutes so i want the veg to sort of have texture after it's cooked peppers in a bit of garlic two nice cloves just slap down off with the shell in now i want to turn up the gas get the pan nice and hot because the minute that sausage goes in everything cools down and you'll end up boiling the peppers and the onions and the garlic so heat up to maximum and then just make a well in the center in now start stirring quickly this is where you get so much more bang for your buck out of sausages because the skin's off and the real flavor of that spicy italian sausage is going to come through what's great about this recipe is that you can use any type of sausage to get the flavor and the heat you want i've gone for the spicy italian but it's just as good with mergers or cheerso a teaspoon paprika in give it that really nice smoky flavor rice in and we're gonna sort of basically sear the rice we call it in the kitchen blasting the rice where we sort of saute the rice for 30 seconds and it takes on all that flavor next white wine so the wine sort of deglazes the pan and washes all that flavor from the bottom of the pan into the rice stock in bring it up to the boil turn it down and let it simmer [Music] double stop to rice turn that gas down and let it simmer for 12 to 15 minutes and just give it the occasional stir keep an eye on it now get ready to finish it slice spring onions diced sweet juicy tomatoes and roughly chop earthy flat leaf parsley spring onions in tomatoes in off with the gas really important otherwise everything becomes overcooked flat leaf parsley in but look at the volume in that pan now that is an amazing way to take spicy italian sausages to a completely different level beautiful [Music] slow cooked fiery lamb cooking's all about being bold and adventurous and this dish is exciting because it's slowly cooked and the longer it cooks the more flavoursome it becomes marinating the lamb first chilis we're gonna use a mixture of red and green take off the tops and just slice in garlic crushed don't worry about chopping these ultra fine just get it in there cooking for up to three hours everything sort of blends and almost sort of purees itself together smoked paprika goes brilliantly well with the chilis two teaspoons in a touch of dried oregano some little cumin seeds the blend and the fragrance that they give out is extraordinary they release a little oil as well and helps to tenderize the lamb a touch of salt pepper cinnamon that sort of sweetens up the lamb olive oil just a tablespoon and the olive oil helps to sort of stick all those wonderful spices to the lamb jump in just start really rubbing at this stage you can leave the lamb to marinade for anything from half an hour to overnight allowing the spices to really penetrate the meat giving amazing results when you tuck in delicious vegetables carrots and onions and that's it sliced secret slicing vegetables from braising is not getting too thin you slice the onions too thin they burn you've got that horrible char taste on that slow braised braising it's just a chef's term that means cooking in liquid on a low heat making the meat incredibly moist and beautifully tender so the secret of braising is having a really nice thick durable pan get that nice and hot just a touch of olive oil in hold the bone because you're in control then into the pan i want that white fat to start rendering so it'll add more fat therefore making it a lot more flavoursome as it braises chilies cinnamon in mix that up and don't be scared you're not burning this you're sort of searing the lamb shanks and this is the important part right at the very beginning we're getting the collar on the lamb which washes off as it braises in the oven so be generous with that color vegetables in wow and then a couple of baileys so now you lift the lamb up and get the lamb sat on top of the vegetables now just glaze the pan with red wine this glazing means that you're you're cleaning the bottom of the pan and you're getting that amazing flavor washed off and lifted up into that sauce can really transform that dish always delays then bring to the boil and cook for about 10 minutes to reduce the wines reduce down by half now for the stock bring that stock back up to the ball and then into the oven now don't cover it when you cover it all the condensation comes off the lid your lamb becomes gray all this effort and that exciting spice gets washed away no lid and in the oven for three hours a slow cook on a low heat of 160 degrees gives the spices time to work and transform the meat so it's mouthwateringly tender now look at those out on to a plate you can just see that meat sliding down juicy and incredibly tender grab it by the the shank roll around that rich delicious sauce look at that and get your sauce nice beautiful just get some mint don't chop it just pick that fresh mint and let it snow and there you go a very spicy delicious melting in the mouth lamb shank amazing you

Using spring ingredients, goats cheese, and mascarpone, This is a cheesy dish that will definitely...",2022-11-26 22:16:02.926159, [Music] now quick question are you looking to get transported to italy in literally 10 minutes from now because i'm going to show you how you can eat like a normal italian with some incredible greens but more importantly delicious cheese with a sumptuous polenta right oscar pan down first vegetable stock okay that's going to be brought up to the boil after that we got a beautiful polenta now this is a quick fire plate okay takes about four and a half minutes to cook super fine grain maize okay delicious over here we've got some beautiful frozen spinach fresh broccolini asparagus super snack peas wild garlic a little bit of lemon a nice firm tart goat's cheese bit of mascarpone butter salt pepper and a touch of olive oil to sort of enrich that planter right let's have 10 minutes on the clock okay first things first get your vegetable stock and bring it up to the ball turn your steamer on and leave that getting nice and hot before you season a stock taste it okay so that just takes off a really nice sort of deep aromatic vegetable stock bring it up to the ball give a little touch of salt give it a touch of chili flakes give a little touch of fresh pepper i like to sit a little bit of extra virgin olive oil on top of my stock in order to make it a little bit more richer let's come to the boil turn the gas down and literally just shake and stir shake and stir now this is a quick fire polenta okay so it gets very thick very quickly now the secret is to make it rich creamy and incredibly moorish look at that beautiful again if you just clump it all in there like that it's going to go a little bit lumpy so take your time sort of making great polentas like making a risotto give it love give it attention and more importantly look after it right plenty in now from there turn the gas down and this is where we're going to start lifting the incredible flavor of that polenta the whisk has done its job in goes my spoon as it comes that nice soft ball you can see it sort of almost a little bit like oatmeal or porridge it's starting to go a little bit sort of you know bubbly turn the gas down continue stirring and now we're gonna lift it up again we're gonna enhance it garlic is something that goes very well in polenta okay but we're gonna fry it microplane and just grate that garlic well that gets it almost pureed quickly and from there you can see now underneath all that beautiful garlic in there so just tap hit it with the back of the spoon get all that garlic in there beautiful now on this really cool [Music] light hint of garlic it's bubbling it's starting to thicken as well still not cooked yet it's been on there for 90 seconds the spinach really important that you just literally get the spinach in your hand and just squeeze out any excess water and then literally bunch it up chop it and go through just go through it once and again you can use fresh spinach if you want it just turns the planter a little bit more watery i like the frozen spillage squeezed out and now put it in in two goes half in and there you go now take that off the heat and start mixing that up so i want that to sit there for a little bit okay whilst the spinach sort of opens up it changes color the plenty goes a little bit darker a little bit richer and look i want to sort of let that hang off spoon glaze the polenta that touch more olive oil let it sit there and i'll come back to that in a minute now vegetables with this i like the healthy idea of steaming the vegetables i've got some fresh asparagus that's broccoli nielsen sugar snap peas over they go lightly season them bunch them up i want a bit of a crunch a little bit of a drizzle on there these little baskets are brilliant for steaming vegetables touch of pepper and even though we're steaming them we can enhance the flavor just a little touch of olive oil on there lid on they're going to take about four four and a half minutes now the polenta how do i get that sort of revved up how do i get it into a different league lemon zest first juice goes in at the end when i add that olive oil it sort of slows it down to a nice rich creamy texture but it needs more richness so now i start adding in my butter and i put sort of nice little slices of butter in get it back on the heat and then we start beating that butter in that's so good so so good don't let it sit there get it in and literally whip it in you'll see why in a minute the heat is on low the butter's melting nicely okay and it's working it's magic and all you're doing is making sure that you've got this lovely creamy texture now for some more green frozen peas get them in okay straight from the freezer get them in and then once i've got that nice consistency the heat of the planter will cook the peas okay it's starting to sort of cook fully it's smelling delicious mascarpone cream cheese that's the winner for me that's the one that literally takes the polenta to a nice rich and delicious planter lemon juice halfway lemon juice in and give that a really good squeeze now back onto the heat whack the heat up i'm cooling it down with the mascarpone cheese i've got the lemon juice in there now my peas are working they're magic the spinach and the peas go beautifully together and now look now that polenta is coming together and that's why this dish is so lovely and so creamy it's just a really nice light way of eating polenta cheese in at the end and this gives it a beautiful added richness i like a aged parmesan pecorino is beautiful we sit goat cheese on top as it's done and look back on and now look what's happened in the last five minutes this polenta become like a royal planter look at that beautiful quick taste time please touch more salt and this has just come into season and it's like the wild garlic leaves i roll that up like a big beautiful monte cristo cigar slice it not too fine and that sort of freshness of that wild garlic at the end is beautiful now if your polenta's getting a little bit too sort of stiff touch more stock touch more mascarpone i'm happy with mine i just love the way it sits on the plate by that bridge and beautiful now gas off when i come to plate it i want to be generous okay on she goes scoop that on there it's got an amazing flavor whatever you don't use on the day set this in the fridge for the next day and it turns out this beautiful fried polenta cake when you crisp it up in the frying pan let that sit vegetables are off and then lock shake that there and then finally olive oil on top a touch of seasoning on top and then goat's cheese just sit down on there that starts the melt time please and then finally this goat cheese will melt beautifully and make the polenta even richer good wash the hands now for your beautiful vegetables look at those they are beautiful really beautiful so they're cooked in lemon we've got a little touch of bite and they're fresh and we could sew to these vegetables but having these steamed in amongst the richness of that polenta is beautiful i love it and it's so healthy good time please and then literally on finally my lemon a touch of my aged para masala and then come on these beauties here it's just mint fresh mint drop it on there fresh mint

Merguez & fontina stuffed croissants, Spiced egg & spinach breakfast wrap & the classic Scotch egg.

#GordonRamsay #Cooking #Food...",2022-11-26 22:16:02.926159, it's breakfast and eggs guaranteed to spice up your day some of the best food i had in india was street food and every little food stall was cooking up something spicy something delicious a teaspoon of oil gonna toast off a teaspoon of cumin mustard seeds a touch of salt and pepper lightly fry them off it's really important to cook off the spices it intensifies the flavor but really draws out that nice spicy deep rich flavor so onion three fingers one in front two behind nice and fine onions in [Music] now we're going to caramelize those onions mustard seeds have started to infuse cumin has that nice kick now with a little touch of butter in there get it nice and sort of rich gas up nice and high and really caramelize those onions now once the onions have turned a rich golden color that's what i'm looking for that is beautiful add baby spinach keep that pan nice and hot if you don't cook it out the actual breakfast ends up watering when the spinach is cooked set aside and it's on to the spicy eggs now the breakfast really starts to come alight four nice eggs now give those eggs a little whisk a little touch of butter into the pan a little teaspoon of oil so the butter doesn't burn when the butter and oil are hot add a teaspoon of garam masala and turmeric cook that out now take your eggs into the pan almost gonna make like a really nice spicy scrambled egg turn the gas down now as the scrambled egg comes together just finish that with a little bit of butter i quite like the sort of creaminess makes it so much more delicious and then from there i get my spinach chop up and then fold in the spinach to your scrambled egg something quite exciting about eating spice for breakfast but it's served in these wonderful little thin naan breads this will work with any flatbread or wrap you fancy and then lightly toast your naan take the eggs off the heat whilst you get on with the last job add quick mint and spice yogurt dressing couple of tablespoons of fresh yogurt in there's always something take out the heat then add chopped mint salt and turmeric mix that in now take a scrambled egg and half fill and now it smells incredible get your yogurt down on top and lift that over and for me that's what really stands out with street food in india how delicious they can make street food with a little bit of spice amazing [Music] once you try this spicy wrap i promise you scrambled eggs will never taste the same a punchy breakfast of murgues and fontina stuffed croissants flavor there is incredible for lunch a spicy mexican soup be adventurous but beware serve with quick tortilla chips and a peek of the gaio dip meggy for dinner i'll be setting the world to right with my eldest megan you're so annoying i'm so annoyed when we make one of the favorite dishes crispy roast duck with pancakes and black bean dipping sauce cena's is your favorite that you can make it followed by a spiced banana tart to tan wow these are my ultimate recipes for a day bursting with a big and bold breakfast lunch and dinner starting with a breakfast that can't fail to wake you up murguez and fontina stop croissants okay big and bold i was living in france i stayed there for three years once twice a week i treated myself to the most amazing bold breakfast and it started off with these beauties here murgays cheap but incredibly tasty start off with a nice hot pan mug is in it's a very spicy sausage doesn't need any help doesn't even chili just a touch of salt and pepper you can smell the spice they started to release all that wonderful oil that flavor in there add a couple of cloves i'll finely slice garlic spread the garlic across the pan it instantly changes color takes on this nice dark rich golden color now take a look at the heat out with the parsley the stalks of soft herbs like parsley and coriander can be used to impart flavour during cooking but the leaves should always be added just before serving to give maximum colour and fragrance [Music] and then finish that off with my capers amazing all right beautiful now take your quest on they're literally 24 hours old so they're crispy on the outside and just slice off the lid this recipe is a great way to use up any leftover croissants from the day before i used to cringe when i saw the french cooks throw away croissants i used to cry thinking oh my god any idea what you're throwing away in terms of flavor whatever you do do not wipe out that pan dunk your croissants mopping up all that amazing flavor and caramelizing the inside for that beautiful and don't forget the lids and then get your thumbs and go inside the croissant all i want to do now is just create a little pocket and just manipulate the question now this is where it gets exciting mix up the capers the garlic and sausages look at the color of that wonderful delicious flavoured oil now some cheese but not just any cheese fontina cheese is like the number one cheese for grilling and because it's a very rich cheese you shave it thinner than you would a white truffle but it gives a really nice saltiness and a light smoky flavor a little touch of pepper salt place these big boys on the tray literally 30 seconds on the grill here we go nice crisp packed full of flavor now top them and that for me it's almost like being back in paris except this time i don't have to share them with the french my ultimate big and bold breakfast murgies and fontina stuffed croissants the perfect picnic breakfast my ultimate scotch eggs with a twist [Music] i go fishing a lot and scotch eggs are the perfect all-in-one mini picnic breakfast first thing get your eggs cooked bring the water up the boil onto the spoon and lower them into the water that way they don't hit the water and crack four and a half minutes that will keep the center nice and slightly runny now ground sausage meat i'm gonna make mine a little bit spicier i'm gonna crumble in black pudding that helps to season the scotch eggs inside a little touch of salt and pepper and then just to make it a little bit sweeter and a lot easier for the kids to eat some grated apple [Music] combine that blend in the apple and the black pudding eggs once they're cooked drain them and then run them under cold water cracking and cooling the eggs quickly will prevent the yolks turning gray tap them on the side of the pan put them back into the water and what happens the water seeps underneath the shell see the shell come off so much easier eggs still slightly soft in the center i want that little bit of richness with the yolk next you need to get yourself organized with a mini assembly line seasoned flour a little egg wash and bread crumbs take your mince golf ball size spread the pate manipulate with your thumb and then sit your egg in there and spread the sausage over the egg and you just seal that over it's really important to keep that nice even coating of sausage meat around the egg you don't want it too thick otherwise it gets too dense and it's unappetizing give them a light dusting in the seasoned flour if you don't put the flour on the egg wash won't stick if you don't put the egg wash on the breadcrumbs won't stick into the egg roll it round shake off any excess egg wash and roll it into your breadcrumbs you can use this same three-stage method to breadcrumb anything you'd like from chicken goujons and fish fillets to fina schnitzel these are panko breadcrumbs japanese white breadcrumb so no crust you can experiment by adding flavors to your breadcrumbs like parmesan herbs or citrus zest i always like to push the actual breadcrumbs into the sausage meat so it gets that really nice golden brown and stops any of the outside burning once bread crumbs lower the eggs carefully into a four centimeter deep bath of hot vegetable oil for 10 to 12 minutes the eggs are actually cooked soft and running the center so the objective is just to cook the sausage meat and the black pudding they look great don't they go and grenades there's something so magical about a scotch egg on a picnic because it's like this little mini breakfast beautiful drain them onto the paper roll them around just to get off any excess oil and then to transport them some greaseproof paper that for me is the perfect start to the fishing trip there's no wonder i never catch any fish because i'm always too busy eating my scotch eggs [Music] my ultimate black pudding lace scotch eggs an irresistibly delicious picnic breakfast

into three and then roll them nice and thinly now lightly flour the surface and then just bring that to like a perfect ball on the board once you've got that nice ball your rolling pin and just roll it out now it doesn't get any simpler than that and just lightly flour that on top a little salt cooking the flatbread is easy just pop in a hot dry pan and they're ready in minutes as it hits the pan it starts the blister she's ready for turning beautiful get that color on there now you want it nice and crisp almost blistering on both sides because it's nice and thin it's cooked once browned on both sides just cool on a rack flatbread's done now on to the muscles now the secret behind cooking great muscles is in the speed you cook the key is to chop and prep your ingredients before you start cooking first thing pancetta i want it quite chunky if you can't get pancetta i always like to use a sort of streaky bacon because i want to sort of render all that flavour at the streaky bacon now tomatoes garlic and chili cherry tomatoes they're just going in whole the garlic just crush the garlic so all that flavor comes out chilli i want some heat in here that's everything prepped now to get it cooked little touch of olive oil pancetta in pancetta takes moments once it's brown and crisp put your garlic chili and whole cherry tomatoes into the pan mussels go in okay and i'm using dry sherry i think it works better in this recipe than white wine which is classically used at this stage then oregano finely chopped stalks and all i'll go on and then just give that a little mix and we'll see those muscles start to open lid goes on you've got to lock in that flavour gotta lock in that heat the mussels will take four to five minutes to steam in the meantime cut your flatbreads into strips crispy and crunchy now the muscles wow that is incredible my goodness me [Music] now that is one lunch i definitely don't want to miss healthy and delicious doesn't get any better than that incredible steam muscles with saffron flatbreads made in minutes and packed with protein and vitamins this is one fast food meal that really is healthy [Music] the great thing about pastry is if you follow the basic rules the possibilities are endless whether it's simple short crust or flaky filo you just need a bit of practice to get it right my first recipe uses lovely buttery shortcuts pastry to make a dish that's as delicious as it is simple leaking pancetta quiche shortcuts pastry is one of the staples of the kitchen it is so versatile but the good news is it's one of the easiest pastries to make trust me when you crack it it can make a real difference to your cooking take a sieve when you think of short crust pastry it's sort of semi-flaky but it's rich buttery start by sipping 200 grams of plain flour into a mixing bowl large pinch of salt 200 grams of unsalted butter bring the butter up to room temperature if you let the butter become too soft then the flour so it doesn't absorb it in with your fingers rub together first now the secret is grab big handfuls and squeeze the butter into the flour so look what's happened literally in 30 seconds i've got that nice crumbly texture now a couple of tablespoons of water nothing worse when the pastry is so wet you can't bring it together it needs to shape like a nice rich cookie dough it's just a touch too dry so one more tablespoon of water [Music] and there you go it's coming nicely now that's what i want a nice sort of firm ball of pastry onto the board i'm going to use these one of the strongest parts of the body pull towards you and push back down use those wrists to really knead it together so just that nice sort of smooth texture now wrap it in cling film set that in the fridge for 20 minutes really important that you let the shortcuts pastry relax [Music] now to make the quiche you can use just an ordinary flan dish but i love making them in many frying pans which gives them an extra rustic charm brush with oil to stop the pastry from sticking once the pastry is at room temperature roll it out to a nice even thickness place it in the center of your little pan turn it in don't use your fingers because what we don't want is any holes in this just get a little bit of dough because that sort of acts like a little sort of mallet flattens it out nicely i'm building a sort of extra lip because that way i can get the filling at it's absolute maximum levels we're going to cook them blind first to blind bake simply means to pre-cook your pastry before adding the filling this ensures you'll have a fantastic crisp pastry add a sheet of foil or baking paper and weigh it down you can use rice pulses or ceramic baking stones just make sure you keep them for the next time in the oven 200 degrees for 10 minutes now for the filling i'm gonna do a classic quiche bacon and leeks this is a amazing cured pancetta pancetta is an italian cured meat made from belly pork seasoning with things like juniper nutmeg fennel a great substitute is unsmoked bacon as the pancetta gets lovely and crispy finely slice leeks and add leeks and bacon nice really important to cook those leeks down that's exactly what i want those leaks are almost sort of caramelized slightly crispy the flavor's amazing and just drain them off so any excess fat gets drained a couple of tablespoons of cream it gives it a really nice richness i want two-thirds garnish i.e bacon and leeks in my quiche and one-third of the savory custard a touch of salt a touch of pepper i'm gonna grate some gruyere cheese that makes a really nice sort of creamy less of an eggy quiche take my amazing crispy pancetta and leeks in give that a good mix needs one more little thing some freshness flat leaf parsley incredible really important just to taste the mixture with the quiche filling ready next finish off the pastry [Music] remove the fall and weight and return to the oven to get it lovely and golden all over [Music] now when we fill them give that a really good mix up [Music] beautiful grate over some more cheese which will bubble up and melt beautifully and then into the oven bake your quiche for 15 to 20 minutes [Music] incredible it's got that nice sort of cheese and toast smell from the top it's sort of baked but the secret of any good quiche is in the short crust because that's the hero we're creating bbq style beef brisket with crunchy coleslaw and sweet potato wedges which will be right up her street holly now you love barbecues right so gonna help me barbecue this delicious piece of brisket brisket look at it beautiful it's a very tough cut of meat so it needs to be cooked slowly so it gets really nice and tender are we barbecuing it outside we're gonna actually put the barbecue

chicken stock or even vegetable stock once the stock has come to the boil cover tightly with foil you just pinch in the ends flat that down and then you just twist all the way so that's nice and tight that's the hard work done thank you simply pop it in the oven for three and a half hours and as it cooks you can get on with the side dishes first job sweet potato wedges with some serious flavor

#GordonRamsay #Cooking #Food #Recieps #Valentine...",2022-11-26 22:16:02.926159, the secret behind a great eggs benedict is in the hollandaise so get your pan on because i'm going to cook our hollandaise over a rolling boil with a glass bowl butter just put it on to melt three egg yolks separated from the white tarragon vinegar pop that into the eggs if you can't get tarragon vinegar any white wine vinegar will do just as long as you've got that acidity in there give some bite to the hollandaise put your bowl over the rolling water and just start whisking if the eggs had diet contact with the gas hollandaise will become scrambled egg once you've got that nice creamy texture a nice thick savvy on start adding your butter nice and slowly a couple of tablespoons of butter in and give that a really nice mix if you don't whisk it enough the egg yolks don't take the butter it causes it to split with more butter using a big balloon whisk like this one makes it easier to incorporate air and helps prevent your mixture from separating all the butter in and the best way to keep hollandaise nice and warm is just leave it to sit over that nice warm water bath and it just keeps at a really nice room temperature a nice pinch of salt fresh pepper and then fresh lemon juice that just really makes it vibrant exciting i want it's like a sort of thick custard i just want it to coat the back of the spoon so it's like you're giving the a nice glossy texture to your beautiful poached egg now as the base for the egg benedict you cannot beat english muffins but the ham i'm gonna change i'm gonna use the most amazing parma ham get your pan nice and hot into the pan it's like posh rashes are bacon beautiful [Music] parlor ham fried nice and crisp like that is incredible beautiful in salads fantastic for eggs benedict [Music] now keep that pan nice and hot i want all that flavor from the parmesan left in there and rather than toast my muffins i want to put the muffins into the pan i want them sucking up all that wonderful flavor from that crispy parmesan make sure your muffins are toasted nicely this will prevent them going soggy later look at that nice and crisp now water on to boil for the eggs nicely seasoned really important i mean just a little splash of vinegar in the water that helps to set the egg white the minute you crack it in while the water heats up in the pan there's time to get organized lay a nice slice of ham on the base now water's brought up to the ball turn it down and then spin your water around like a little whirlpool then get a little cup so you just drop the cup in and look what happens to the egg gets caught up in the turbulence of the water the secret is not to ball the water rapidly because the strength of the ball can literally explode your egg as they start to move the way up to the top of the water that's a indication that they're cooked take off any excess little bits of egg white and then out onto a piece of tissue paper that just drains off excess water that stops your muffin from getting really soggy but look they're like little beautiful mozzarella balls give them a little season lift them on to your crispy parmesan useful now get a nice spoon of your hollandaise glaze over try and do it in one glazing over the whole egg [Applause] when i tell jack holly and megan and matilda that we're cooking eggs benedict for breakfast they bolt down the stairs and let's be honest who wouldn't run to sit in front of those [Music] a special occasion breakfast that would make anyone feel spoiled eggs benedict with crispy parmesan [Music] aren't they small yeah it's tiny so it's almost like a sort of nice entrance into eating something slightly gamey okay if you give them a nice season for me salt and pepper and all spatchcock means is that the rib cage has been taken out and they're flattened down and because the bird is so delicate it's flattened to cook evenly and it really is a nice sort of light gamey dense chicken flavor so we're toaster spices when you think of middle eastern food it's packed with amazing flavors tablespoon of coriander a teaspoon of cumin and a nice little seasoning of salt so we toast them now intensifying the flavor when they start smoking lightly that's a nice indication that they're ready okay if you grind away so the best thing there let's just stand a little closer today thank you oh look your tummy's out i thought it was the quail it was a little tummy this hand here keeps it nice and firm and you grind that into a nice powder for belly please smells so good doesn't it yeah so to get that in really go around the outside and that grinds it up i've gone around i press the mortar more times than you kissed boys squeeze the garlic in next a little glove a volleyball okay then i want you to pour six tablespoons please so that is pomegranate molasses so it's like an aged balsamic vinegar but really reduced down give that a nice mix up is it going to be very sweet dad a little taste it's sweet but sour yeah it is it's so good though no take a nice spoon put it inside the quail you can even do this the night before because if you pop them in the fridge let the quail marinate anywhere from half an hour to overnight for my ultimate middle eastern dessert it's got to be baklava start by melting butter in a pan chop pistachios in a blender [Music] then combine with caster sugar and lemon zest [Music] brush the melted butter around a small baking tray place half a sheet of filler pastry on the base brush well with melted butter and sprinkle with a pistachio mix repeat and press down between layers you're looking to create 30 to 35 layers [Music] then cut the baklava into bite-size rectangles and bake in a preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes meanwhile make your delicious citrusy syrup simply add water to a pan along with caster sugar and the zest and juice of a lemon simmer for seven to ten minutes making sure the sugar has fully dissolved now to give the cloud a wonderful sweetness remove from the oven and whilst hot pour over the syrup so each layer is gloriously sticky leave the balcava to absorb the syrup for at least 12 hours these delicious sticky treats will keep for a week but they're so moorish they'll be gone in a flash the quails have marinated now they're ready to cook nice hot pan pick up your quail and skin side down first okay get all that nice color and always open them up as well in the pan okay we'll get that skin crisp crispy that's right smell that pomegranate i can really smell it smells so good get all that marinade in there you know cook with it as well don't waste it how long on average does it take to cook could you say literally 12-15 minutes in the oven a little touch of water in [Music] bring that up to the ball into the oven 180 so 12 to 15 minutes [Applause] okay the final job before serving a herby butter bean salad to go with my quail in pomegranate molasses now one of the things that i love about middle eastern salads is the sort of crunch and the color as well butter beans it's gonna be the base of our salad from their little radishes and sort of top and tail them get them like that and throw them in there's nothing small and dainty in there okay so with the spring onions nice we're gonna use the greens and the whites i'm gonna slice along that way this time it's got those nice light shards okay yeah now the croutons are made out of these little pita breads just slice lengthways in with a salad oh yes so this salad is all about texture so cucumber okay and take out your seeds how come you're taking the seeds out it just makes the salad very watery it's like a shower okay cucumber juice delicious i think there should go yeah you got me going you really got me going no no no oh yeah i've got revision to be doing don't worry this is far more important trust me who needs exams where you can cook for a living you gave me with my exams it's fine it's fine it's fine be a chef for a living have a proper job don't take your things out like that you'll be thumbless let's go now your cucumber in from there take your nice vibrant tomatoes slice down it almost looks like a greek salad as well colors it resembles that that's right and with the celery like before yeah lengthwise so we need some mint and parsley i want you sprinkling it in there really mix it through the herbs give it that nice kind of freshness but i want a bit of a bite in there now i love pomegranate so just carefully open that up okay and then just dot them on top so we got a bit of fruitiness now into the salad for crunch simply cut up whole pita breads fry in a really hot pan with olive oil until wonderfully golden crispy and irresistible out into a sieve okay next a sprinkle of sumac that's a dried fruit from middle east the zest of a lemon and the juice then a drizzle of olive oil and last but not least my crunchy pitter croutons croutons on oh they've gotten hard oh just lift that up and mix in with your hands there nice and juicy just with fingertips there you go so you just mix there you go it doesn't crush anything it doesn't crush anything but then let's just take a little bean wow is that delicious um nice now quail it's got that really mmm sort of toasted almost like a sort of light smells so good barbecue flavor can't wait to try it beef wow just finely a bit of lemon zest it just lightens everything up a little bit and it goes so well with the pomegranate now just wow that'll smell better than any boyfriend you'll ever have oh my god i beg to differ okay good let's go how delicious is that so delicious my middle eastern feast of quail with a pomegranate molasses and butter bean salad with batlava to follow when dishes are this aromatic and colorful there's no wonder that middle eastern food is always a hit i know you love chocolate right we'll break this up so it melts nice and evenly all right that goes over a memory and you can't put the chocolate in direct contact with the gas yeah okay otherwise it will split crack four eggs in that room please of course hold on like that on the side and then your fingers in and pull out okay good nice now you're cracking eggs with one hand nice one i need some mussels okay start whisking and i'll fold in a bit of sugar come on let's do 30 seconds each ready okay come on jack give it some 13 year old welly come on some muscles 10 seconds to go nine eight seven six five four three two one all right here we go your tummy sugar let's go you see the secret to whisking vigorously is changing hands every 10 seconds yep now i'm going to stir the chocolate i'll stir that up now the secret behind this is getting it really nice and thick and that's like a stabbing on okay your turn come on change change again yeah of course also the chocolate leave that to slightly cool down a touch from there cream in why putting the cream in separately because i'm gonna get it nice and thick first if you start whisking that i'm gonna get in the vanilla to maximize the flavor from a vanilla bean cut the pot in half lengthways and scrape out those wonderfully aromatic seeds for extra flavor put the pod in as well but remember to take it out once it's infused so we've got three components the melted chocolate yes sugar yes and the eggs whipped up and the cream with the vanilla next mix in your melted chocolate with the sugar and egg saber on so you got a nice rich chocolate ganache smell that delicious now i'm putting the cream and so you just whisk that in now look at that how gorgeous is that looking and that my son is a chocolate semi-freddo now they taste [Music] pistachio that's right sprinkle them in now get your baking tray you line that with cling film so it's easy to pull out once it sets and then you just pour that in that is a real treat so you fold that over okay is this like ice cream in any way yeah as it sets you slice it it's like this nice chocolate ice block delicious then put your semifredo into the freezer for around three hours to set right jack get that pan nice and hot recognize that fillet of beef this is a rolls-royce cup of beef so we've got to treat it with some respect okay yeah mop up all that seasoning yeah into the pan and get that really nice and hot hello guys um what's that what's the name bit of garlic and thyme in there cooking with these aromatic herbs and garlic will add flavor to the beef because it's a fillet of beef there's hardly any fat on there so you sear it quickly ends as well gets seared gonna now put some butter in there continue frying all those herbs now baste that with the butter see dad are we just having this or we're gonna have something with it now we're gonna serve some beautiful baked potatoes with truffle and a salsa verde into the oven eight to ten minutes that's all next my super special baked new potatoes wash and drain small new potatoes and tip into a baking tray drizzle with olive oil then season with a touch of salt and freshly ground black pepper place into an oven preheated at 180 degrees celsius and bake for 35 minutes until crisp on the outside and soft all the way through

Pre-order your copy...",2022-11-26 22:16:02.926159, now how's your boyfriend right i'm going come on that woke you up didn't it so what do you love most about duck the dipping sauce the dipping sauce i love that let's get the duck in the set a bit of salt in there please then some pepper thank you some spring onion garlic and ginger now why do you think we put that in there to season it and flavor it how come do you put them in hole like that not smaller it's going inside i'm not using it for sauce or anything so it's just going to make it really nice what are they star anise sorry so what happens as the duck roasts on the outside it creates this really nice perfume aroma inside tuck that in there to get it spicy rub all that chinese fire spice yeah over almost like you're massaging good so make sure you get it all in even the little wings you know underneath there just like i used to do to you in the bath i used to wash your little handys i know those days are long gone i know i know i know i should die that is seriously spicy with the duck there's generally quite a lot of fat there yeah so we can put it on this little bench okay and that goes there by slowly roasting it okay it's gonna get nice and crisp on the outside all that fat is gonna render inside the breast so therefore it's gonna get all nice and juicy yeah right ducks in three and a half hours at 160 degrees celsius your favorite part you said was the dipping sauce why is it your favorite part i think it really adds to the dark it makes it really tasty cena's is your favorite you can make it i'm gonna do nothing okay daddy's gonna put his feet up so uh first off the garlic there's one good girl watch your fingers please always do good nice oh you're fast huh watch your fingers i am watch your fingers slide slow down please 14. all right that's enough right a little teaspoon of olive oil in a few years time i'll be teaching you how to drive as well as cook how exciting is that unite in a car scary okay garlic in crispy duck is traditionally served with hoisin sauce but my brood love the additional big bold punch of black beans nice megan and i add soy sauce and lastly for that classic chinese sweet and sour element brown rice vinegar and honey [Music] are you happy with the flavour i'm really happy you can taste everything in there dipping sauce done ducks in the oven let's start the dessert the most amazing tata tan are those pink peppercorns they are pink peppercorns they're really good they don't taste anything like black peppercorns quite sweet aren't they they're really sweet very fruity the pink peppercorns give it the sweetness the black peppercorns give the heat now what is that baby vanilla this is one of the easiest desserts in the world to make but one of the most delicious it's a sort of take on the classic apple or pear to tan but when you caramelize those bananas with the peppercorns and the vanilla i bet that tastes amazing oh my goodness incredible okay i'm gonna make the caramel start off with the coal pen first and you just press that butter in there how come do you do it like that and not let it just melt naturally because i want the butter to stay cold because i'm gonna stick the bananas in there okay and then we'll make the caramel and caramelize the bananas at the same time so in goes those vanilla vanilla seeds pods in there as well okay peppercorns done yeah well done good girl sprinkle them over that butter just naturally naturally nice and then look just very carefully sprinkle sugar over that you're doing them all the same size roughly the same size wedge it into the butter well do you know what want the bananas really caramelised you just them between if you crown them in like this okay it will stop them moving around nothing's moving nothing is okay so all wedged in there spreading the peppercorns on top of the bananas so you've got that flavor in the caramel and on the top and the bottom right puff pastry puff pastry is difficult and time-consuming to make so i always buy ready-made when i'm at home to get the best flavor and texture go for the all-butter type and keep your pastry cold before using it this is where it gets really exciting you get your fingers you just pinch the end so you thin the end if you do that for me very carefully you have to be quick because the heat of your fingers can melt the pastry how comes you do it because we get it nice and thin so we can clip it underneath now take a spoon and what we do is lift up that banana and tuck it underneath let's see lift up a little parcel like a parcel and see the thin bits of pastry yeah how easy it is to get it underneath yeah and that's why you thin them out you do it so quickly well because i have to be quick otherwise the pastry will melt notice how we're not using anything sharp so we're not would that cut the pastry that's right see how locked down that is [Music] gas on we'll start caramelizing that those three little holes are so important if we didn't put a hole in the pastry and it will cause a lot of steam so the pastry never cooks it just goes really soggy okay so really important the caramel is live now we're working the camel give a little shake how can you see the caramel through the pastry look what happens when it tilts oh yeah see all comes running down see yeah i see now that pastry okay it's like clinging on to the bananas and so when we turn it upside down we've got this glove full of these caramelised bananas look at that wow it looks like look a locky a locky ah look at likey got you now baby you're sorry i'm sorry it's your birthday soon 15. i just worked out i'm my 50th you're 18. perfect we should do a joint party yeah i love it 12 2 4 for the old ones 12 lunchtime time till four for the old one so they can go to sleep megan will go on later come on perfect here's why i get excited now look at the color of that caramel so tilt the pan again see how dark it is now yeah wow it's gone a lot darker now it didn't take long didn't take long at all that's nearly ready for the oven but before i put that in i'll get the duck out wow how's the duck doing crispy wow and delicious how crispy that is it's really crispy that's what happens when it slow cooks so 20 minutes for the duck to rest and 20 minutes in the oven 190 to 200 degrees for our banana tartar tan time to knock up a quick hoisin and cucumber salad to put in our crispy duck pancakes for the dressing combine hoisin sauce rice wine vinegar soy sauce a dash of sesame oil and to give it that zingy asian punch some freshly grated root ginger [Music] for the salad trim and cut spring onions into very fine matchsticks peel a whole cucumber into long thin ribbons and shred in a couple of baby gem lettuces season and toss this fresh crunchy salad in the sweet yummy hoisin dressing a combination that never fails to get the kids eating their greens wow look at that so see now where that pastry is caramelising caramel so dark and just a little tip gas back on and that will release it because if you tip it and it's still sticking then some of your bananas will stick yeah so now see when it starts spinning around like that moving around and here we are the moment of truth when you know your daddy is the best chef in the world ready yep wow the vanilla how delicious is really good as well right start to stand out done crispy dipping sauce cucumber salad ready so if you take them and your dipping sauce take them over thank you i'll take the duck don't drop it promise oh okay yeah it was amazing my ultimate big and bold dinner of crispy roast duck with pancakes with a hoisin dress salad and some extra oomph from megan's favorite black bean dipping sauce caramelised figs with ricotta slow cooking can also take desserts to a whole new level a gentle long cook can really bring out that wonderful rich sticky sweetness and that depth of flavor in fruits these are black figs they are suited to slow cooking roasting better than the green fix because this outside skin is so durable this is an amazing way of roasting figs and it's so easy yet so delicious lay your figs out in rows take some rosemary and just peel that down get that really nice fragrant stem get your scissors trim the edge almost we've got a bit of a sort of sharp point bring your three figs together and just thread the top of each fig nice and gently rosemary works wonderfully with sweet dishes as the figs roast in the oven the stalk will impart a lovely subtle flavor useful dust the figs with icing sugar then coat them with a generous splash of basil with vinegar leave them to sit there for five minutes this sort of marinade i know it sounds odd to use vinegar in your dessert but trust me it gives the dish a fantastic sweet and sour taste i'm gonna make a really nice caramel four or five tablespoons of sugar now flatten that out and get it nice and even when the sugar is even caramel cooks evenly it's changing now you can see it melting from the outside in the one thing you don't do is shake the pan rapidly and see it almost like sort of a lake defrosting and it's hitting to the center bubbling still not dark enough yet it's getting there turn the gas down and stay in control let the sugar melt until it turns a dark amber color the secret behind any good caramel is just stopping it from overcooking lovely take that off the gas knob of butter in there just gently whisk in the butter it's cooling the caramel down you'll see it changing color to like a cafe lay next add a log of the balsamic vinegar nice beautiful got that nice dark richness of the caramel a little touch of water in there that way the caramel doesn't go too thick now put the caramel back on the heat take your figs and sort of place them in gently lovely and then just add all that lovely little marinade [Music] don't waste that it's amazing stuff there [Music] icing sugar embossed on the vinegar there's something so tasty baste those figs because the skin gets nice and crispy on the outside and the fig sort of just absorbs the caramel delicious so easy now into the oven 190 for 10 minutes [Music] almost doubled in size now look at the color on them the smell is incredible onto your plate they're a lot heavier because they've actually started absorbing that caramel now douse the figs with caramel and serve with ricotta cheese the freshness of that ricotta goes brilliantly well with the figs i'm gonna finish that now with some zest and then some little nibbed almonds and the rich creamy jam texture of the fig with the ricotta is brilliant that is an amazing way of slow roasting fruit and taking figs to a completely new level [Music] pan on for the stuffing it's a saddle of lamb basically a sort of rolls-royce cut perfectly shaped and it suits stuffing to an absolute tea for the stuffing finely chop an onion garlic nice thin slices oil in onions and garlic in [Music] salt and pepper make sure the stuffing is beautifully seasoned so it helps to season the inside of the lamb now we've got the color on those onions we're gonna throw in some pine nuts and that helps to give a bit of a texture here's where it starts getting really exciting spinach in and just lay the spinach over the pine nuts it looks like a lot of spinach that's going to condense and disappear almost instantly there's so much more flavor in spinach when you saute it as opposed to steaming it or boiling it gas off look at that now to bring that together no eggs no breadcrumbs crumpled feta over the spinach feta cheese adds a beautifully salty sharp and creamy flavor what this does it brings our stuffing together now open up the lamb keep those little fillets to the side that's the channel that we want to stuff so i want to just open that up a little bit there salt and pepper lightly and before we put our stuffing in we're going to season it with soulmate sumac is a wonderful lemony spice that goes brilliantly with lamb and you can get it in most big supermarkets and it sort of cuts through that thick rich sweetness of the lamb open up that lamb there take a spoon if you're preparing this for the day ahead then let the stuffing cool down it's inevitable when you start rolling it and tying it something's gonna squeeze out so load up the ends take these beauties these little fillets and just support that stuffing and sort of increase that beautiful tunnel and then from there over there and bring that towards you and then roll like i said some of the stuff is going to come out now just tie it first off around the side and don't worry about some flash butcher's knot just tie it one in the middle you can get butcher string from your local butcher or at cookware shops i got two ties go to tight it just forces all that stuffing out of the lamb when it's in the oven nice now we'll just season the top of it roll the joint to make sure all the skin gets seasoned now you think normally that just goes in the oven like that that's how my mum would do it but get your tray onto the gas oil in get it very nicely coloured none of your stuffing is coming out the sides really important look at that color beautiful does kick start the roasting process gas off into the oven cook for 45 to 55 minutes depending on how pink you want your lamb lift the lamb out of the fat to rest resting it raised up in the tin will stop it cooking but not cool it down too quickly and means you won't lose any of those lovely juices next i'm making a simple but sophisticated accompaniment for the lamb top and tail the cucumber peel it cut the cucumber into three and just core taking out all that it's just sort of watery seedy and it spoils the flavor slice cucumber cucumber in really nice way of making a cheap and cheerful cucumber look glamorous we're gonna dress that cucumber with a nice fresh yogurt a couple of tablespoons next some fresh mint dressing a touch of salt a touch of pepper and then pomegranate molasses that just sweetens it up finish that with lemon mix that up lamb is rested carefully take off the string and then just gently pull them back a serrated edge knife that's going to cut through that crispy fat on the outside instantly i tied it purposely so i can get my portion control from the lines hold it nice and firmly look at your line where the string was and look this one is going to be amazing lay and down just in those two slices there it proves that stuffing meats is for special occasions because that is a saddle of lamb at its absolute best stuffing meats and fish not only makes them look fantastic it also gives them an extra added flavor dimension too once you've mastered the technique you'll be able to turn out dishes that will guarantee you'll have an unforgettable feast so if you want wrap the chocolate start breaking up in little bits we're going to make the most amazing white chocolate mousse our first job is to bring half of our cream up to the boil so what kind of cream is that in there dad that is double cream okay so that's gonna make a really nice rich chocolate mousse what's your favorite sort of chocolate is it white milk dark um i love white and milk what's yours i absolutely love milk chocolate oh that's my guilty pleasure is it really here we go cream in so that goes in there now you can see what's happening straight away can't you it's melting really quickly melting really quickly so okay oh excuse me at least your jumper's white so you won't spot it yeah i've got a nice little snack for later in another bowl add lime zest cold cream and whisk until it forms soft peaks the lime cuts the sort of richness of the cream and that starts to make the chocolate mousse taste a little bit lighter mmm it smells really good the lime gives it a really nice zingyness xenos you're absolutely right next add to the melted chocolate mixture because i'm whisking it's just getting lighter and lighter and lighter have a little taste nice yeah the lime gives it a really nice taste telly i need the rest for the mousse i need them for my tummy no come on chocolate moves into the fridge our next job is to separate out three egg whites this is where i need you at your absolute best okay because to whip those whites it's gonna be really tough so we'll take it in turns 30 seconds each okay you go first 10 seconds gone come on tilly 15 seconds gone 20 seconds gone come on you can do it 10 seconds to go five four three two one and change exit hold the ball right no no way [Music] 30 seconds this puny little thing and you come with a big little machine gun that's the best way of whipping up egg whites start tipping that sugar in slowly don't look very happy in there our contentious whipped egg whites will make our mousse light and airy and when they've reached soft peaks we can gently mix in our cool white chocolate and cream mixture once the egg whites hit the cream yeah the chocolate sets the egg whites keep the cream nice and fluffy and you get this nice light mousse in the bowl now i need you to crush some raspberries please with some fresh you can see all mint juice coming out now take your mousse wow that looks really cool now look at that down the bottom there little crushed raspberry delicious now i'm going to set that in the fridge if you miss a count over the door please our yummy white chocolate mousse will take at least two hours to set so we can crack on with our mediterranean-inspired vegetarian starter griddle courgette ricotta and mint bruschetta for this recipe you'll need a griddle pan an essential piece of kit for that char grilled look cut thick slices of chapatta bread drizzle both sides with olive oil season with a little salt and pepper and griddle each side until toasted then slice a couple of courgettes diagonally into half a centimetre thick pieces drizzle and coat in olive oil and season with salt and pepper sear on a smoking hot griddle pan in batches until all the cagets are bar marked on both sides next roughly chop mint leaves and combine with creamy ricotta cheese spread your toasty topata with dollops of minty ricotta and top with your seared courgette super simple and super tasty now we're going to make a delicious beetroot risotto we need to get the shallots just slice them in half and then just chop them like that okay okay now have you ever made a risotto no i haven't actually shallots please into the pan for daddy add a sprinkle of salt and pepper along with a couple of crushed cloves of garlic once you start cooking the risotto it's really important to have your stock gently boiling away if we're adding cold stock on top of the rice all the time it just slows down the process generally you cook a nice wide flat pan if you cook in a deep pan all the rice sort of cooks at different temperatures what stock is that in there dad because that's a vegetable stock yeah because you can't have different stocks if it's more vegetarian can you i made that mistake once putting beef stock in the vegetarian soup no i didn't matilda are you sure i'm positive i'm joking fry off time how nice does that smell it smells delicious rice in that's a bit of a different rice this is elboria rice it's a perfect rice for risotto now it's really important to sear the rice if we were just to put the stocking without sweating off the rice it goes all starchy so keep on stirring for daddy it's just gonna make a fun day no flambe on the risotto to go with our deep red beetroot theme i'm adding red wine followed by the first ladle of stock to get things started now we're off wow it's giving it a cloudy sort of look what's happening to the stock the stock is reducing down and the rice is sucking it in that's right so the rice is actually getting nice and plump whenever risotto is live when it's like this now we can't stop cooking there we have to kill it all the way okay ready for the next ladle i'm ready good girl here we go ladle in so we have to make this for literally 20 25 minutes and we're nursing it all the way beetroots peel them rub them a little bit of salt and sugar yeah and a little bit of aged balsamic vinegar in there roasted them i'm a great my parmesan how's that rice doing the rice is doing good now that is exactly where we want to be now look look at that nice glossy textured rice so beetroot i want you to put two thirds of the beetroot in there for me saving one-third for the top good sprinkle the parmesan in there for me please all over nice it's like it's snowing again and then we're just gonna get some nice butter in there the butter gives the risotto a really nice gloss look at that beautiful let that come down let it come down first all right get your spoon in there now for daddy beautifully there you go good wonderful shake it risotto should be like lava it just flows out and then the rest of the beetroot on top and then finish some extra virgin olive oil on top there i'll pick up the bruschetta you take that to the table okay let's go daddy this is my ultimate vegetarian dinner delicious courgette ricotta and mint top bruschetta an anxious roasted beetroot and thyme risotto and for put an indulgent white chocolate and lime mousse with fresh crushed raspberries you

we're going to give this a little bit of vibrancy lots of coriander cilantro fresh yogurt jalapeno with the vinegar the brine in there and some lemon juice then we're going to grate this beautiful sort of exciting carrot and turn it into an amazing salad with some orange juice and zest dukkha is a beautiful little middle eastern spice that's going to help sort of lift the flavor splat smoked almonds touch the chili and this is going to combine into a beautiful dish let's now 10 minutes on the clock right first things first with these tenders they are so tasty again upsets me because you always see them on kids meals and you know for babies but adults should eat them because they are incredible lightly season them salt pepper a little hint of chili just a hint okay now you can poach them so to them i prefer to steam them simple little basket steamer in parchment paper on and they take about three and a half to four minutes to steam they are so good on they go now from there i want to make the mojo sauce first this is a really simple delicious sauce and it's got a lot of oomph lift and flavor okay in there i've got a nice sprinkling of coriander cilantro two nice tablespoons of fresh yogurt after that a tablespoon of some beautiful jalapeno but that juice is delicious a couple of tablespoons in there and that gives a little bit of sort of vibrance to that sauce fresh mint goes in and then literally a touch of salt a little touch of chili a little touch of pepper and then roll your lime squash it down okay because that is what gives it the acidity and when we dress the quinoa and the chicken this sauce just comes alive a nice big squeeze of lime juice in there lime or lemon i'm preferring lime now let that sit down lid on and literally blitz that for 10 seconds [Music] [Music] from there lift that up taste that it's so lovely it's got the heat it's got the acidity it's so good really good now the carrots how do we take these plain jane carrots and turn them to something magical you know when you think about cooking carrots exciting especially slow blazing i prefer especially across the spring of the summer to literally grate the carrot and a nice raw fresh grated salad now i'm using some beautiful purple carrots and some normal carrots and look it forms a beautiful salad and they just taste sweet you can use a mandolin i prefer them grated because they're a lot easier to digest from there a little touch salt and pepper and then this beautiful middle east spiced zucca it's fragrant and it gives a sort of a sort of welcomed lift the sweetness of those carrots get your beautiful orange just zest that origin orange carrots spice salt pepper delicious don't waste that look take that blood orange off squeeze that over those carrots be generous with that okay look at that orange beautiful and then from there literally just half a tablespoon of olive oil now mix that up i like doing this literally too much before the chicken cooks because it keeps the crunch but the next day even better i've even sauteed it the next day it's got that nice sort of sweet marinade crunch check the seasoning wow that's so nice time please halfway this is such a quick delicious ditch it's so lovely now quinoa you know not everybody's favorite but it's a really nice starch and packed with flavor i like to sort of lightly dress it and make it a little bit more exciting with some olive oil and fresh lemon juice it's a sort of staple in the household because it's incredibly healthy and it just lightens up the load especially across the summer and again it's sort of almost taken over from lentils it's healthy it's delicious and it's got a bit of texture very good now well four minutes in they are done okay before they come out i'm just gonna put a touch of that mohawk sauce on there i'm just gonna coat the top literally and let that sit there and almost marinate how do we dress this dish things are gonna sort of sit naturally on the plate for me the secret here is not to overdress the salad i've got a nice light vibrant sauce i'm going to build that salad up so start off with my basic greens on the bottom okay then i'm going to take some of my quinoa we'll sprinkle that over and literally sprinkle and i mean sprinkle it then i get my salad and just drop it over and you can see the sort of contrast of the crunch and that beautiful healthiness taking place tenders out oh my goodness these smell so good and then literally sit on top now i come back my second little dressing okay a little bit of rocket a little bit of baby gem a little bit of radicchio and it's almost like a sort of a nice 80z of salad in there as intriguing every step of the way and then just literally sprinkle again your seasoned quinoa and it just gives a lift now i quite like a lot of sauce it's a really nice sort of vibrant way of eating i'm not gonna drain the salad that's why i don't dress the salad i let the actual

TikTok:...",2022-11-25 22:16:02.926159, slow cooking is one of the best weapons in the chef's arsenal not only is it easy it's also an incredible way to transform meat into mouth-wateringly melting dishes mastering the art of slow cooking is something every cook should learn first up my phenomenal slow cooked beef short ribs slow cooking is a brilliant way of getting lots of extra depth and intensity into your dishes the secret is to lock in all those flavors at the start and let the ingredients do their thing as it cooks these are beef short ribs and there's basically five to six bones across there and as the short rib cooks it sticks to that bone the bone implants flavor and the meat just sort of melts cooks slowly gives it that nice level intensity slice alongside the bone straight down you can see that marbling that sort of disappears and disintegrates i'm cooking them in a roasting tray get it on the heat until nice and hot season these short ribs beautifully olive oil in bone on the top we'll start coloring that in [Music] it's really important to give the beef short rib a really nice sear if you didn't brown the meat off it goes in the oven and it looks like boiled meat so you really want that nice dark rich coloring just cut the garlic in half slide that down the side that's going to give that beef an amazing flavor [Music] to give body to the sauce stir in a heaped teaspoon of tomato just hitting the bottom of the pan with that tomato puree and we call it cooking out that smell of puree otherwise it just goes in there raw and it gives this sort of tartness to the braised short ribs red wine in don't use an expensive bottle of red wine there's no need bring the wine up to the boil and reduce it this burns off the alcohol and concentrates the flavor it makes a big difference when you reduce the red wine down by half because it gives that nice dark rich intensity look at my garlic that is just gonna sweeten everything up incredible stock in beef stock perfect chicken stock fine just to about an inch underneath the beef short ribs bring it up to the ball to lock in all that flavor as the beef ribs slow cook cover them so they braise from the bottom and steam from the top into the oven two and a half hours 170 to 180 degrees in she goes great thing about slow cooking is you do most of the work in advance and then put your feet up five or ten minutes before the beef short ribs come out of the oven start your garnish it's a light cured pancetta we want nice thick lardons nice big thick sticks of crispy bacon [Music] these are delicious chestnut mushrooms i'm not going to slice them i'm just going to cut them in half but look at the colour on those lardons now all the whites raw fat have disappeared the lardons have shrunk right down and all we've got there now is the proper bacon mushrooms in beautiful so the mushrooms get seasoned from the bacon i'm pan frying these separately to the beef so they remain crisp another different texture [Music] leave that to cool down now this is like christmas day for me when you unwrap that fall wait you see what's underneath it [Music] wow they smell incredible lift and place on your tray beautiful to make a fantastic rich deep sauce press the soft roasted garlic through a sieve into the cooking juices all that nice pureed garlic coming through there because that is going to make the most amazing flavor scrape all of that off the sieve nice then just start sieving all that lovely brazing liquor wow in that smells delicious take your sauce and just glaze do them individually they deserve that respect spoon on your bacon and your mushrooms beautiful be generous with these mushrooms i'm telling you they taste amazing flat leaf parsley all that freshness over those amazing ribs incredible never ever be embarrassed about going to your butcher and asking for cheap cuts because the results are incredible amazing beef braised short ribs with bacon and mushrooms it's wise to save leftover wine for cooking my tip is to freeze the remaining wine in freezer bags or ice cube trays it's great in stocks and sauces when you need to chill wine fast simply add a large handful of salt to your ice bucket the salt reduces the freezing point of the water which will chill your wine in six minutes flat a delicious saffron flatbread with mussels it doesn't get any healthier than that first job the super easy saffron flatbread put the saffron into the bowl and a couple of teaspoons of hot water that starts to infuse the saffron and so you can maximize on the color across your flatbeds to make the dough simply add plain flour a pinch of salt and pepper to a bowl and then pour in a dash of olive oil that makes the dough nice and silky and rich your saffron water you'll see how concentrated it is now and you'll need cold water then simply need to bring the dough together mop up all your flour you can see now the saffron's activated it's got that really nice color beautiful use your wrist and just knead it nicely we'll do now is smoothing out the gluten strands push and tuck in push and tuck in and each every time you do this getting softer you just sort of form like this perfect beautiful dough it smells delicious that saffron is very powerful now sit that in your bowl cover it with cling film let it rest for 10 to 15 minutes this relaxes the dough making it easier to roll and gives it time to infuse with the saffron i'm going to cut that into three and then roll them nice and thinly now lightly flour the surface and then just bring that to like a perfect ball on the board once you've got that nice ball your rolling pin and just roll it out now it doesn't get any simpler than that and just lightly flour that on top a little salt cooking the flatbread is easy just pop in a hot dry pan and they're ready in minutes as it hits the pan it starts the blister she's ready for turning beautiful get the color on there now you want it nice and crisp almost blistering on both sides because it's nice and thin it's cooked once browned on both sides just cool on a rack flatbread's done now on to the mussels now the secret behind cooking great muscles is in the speed you cook the key is to chop and prep your ingredients before you start cooking first thing pancetta i want it quite chunky if you can't get pancetta i always like to use a sort of streaky bacon because i want to sort of render all that flavor at the streaky bacon now tomatoes garlic and chili cherry tomatoes they're just going in whole the garlic just crush the garlic so all that flavor comes out chilli i want some heat in here that's everything prepped now to get it cooked little touch of olive oil pancetta in pancetta takes moments once it's brown and crisp put your garlic chili and whole cherry tomatoes into the pan mussels go in okay and i'm using dry sherry i think it works better in this recipe than white wine which is classically used at this stage then oregano finely chopped stalks and all i'll go on and then just give that a little mix and we'll see those muscles start to open lid goes on you've got to lock in that flavor gotta lock in that heat the muscles will take four to five minutes to steam in the meantime cut your flatbreads into strips crispy and crunchy now the mussels wow that is incredible my goodness me [Music] now that is one lunch i definitely don't want to miss healthy and delicious doesn't get any better than that incredible steamed mussels with saffron flatbreads made in minutes and packed with protein and vitamins this is one fast food meal that really is healthy

So today he's taking all that inspiration and turning it into a delicious Asian Noodle Dish packed with Asian greens,...",2022-11-25 22:16:02.926159, [Music] now let me tell you some of my favorite dishes come from food stalls around asia and today i'm transporting you back to that beautiful country indonesia where honestly i learned that the best noodles come from those street food stalls so are you ready for a delicious asian noodle dish in just 10 minutes oscar pan down please right uh beautiful noodles yeah food on noodles um straight forward they're already cooked simple asian greens spring onions some beautiful little bean sprouts bacon we're gonna render that bacon down to get the fat out and then use that fat to flavor this incredible dish my travels in indonesia one thing i did learn is you waste nothing so watch carefully and let's get 10 minutes on the clock right uh if you've got a wok brilliant you haven't a large frying pan turn the gas up we want to create some flavor so first thing you want to do is get some bacon this is sort of streaky lean bacon and what i'm going to do now is render that fat down because there's two things going on i want the sort of protein from the bacon but more importantly i want the flavor from it okay so i'm going to cut nice large noodles the street food phenomenon in indonesia is incredible you can actually eat sometimes better on the street than you can in a restaurant it's that good start off with a little bit of oil that helps to get the fat rendered quicker bacon goes in okay and the secret here is to get a bit of texture for this dish now my noodles are already cooked they're blanched so we'll be reheating them but get some heat in there first and get that nice crispy bacon flavor now the sauce don't go too crazy on this okay because i like it quite spicy i like it quite sort of acidic but be smart on the variance especially with the heat in goes the minced garlic okay next our ginger and that makes it a lot more fragrant how do we get the balance right some brown sugar some beautiful sweet brown sugar a little bit of top rashi spice that gives a really nice sort of heat and a kick to it next a nice teaspoon of ground coriander and then of course two parts flip that bacon two parts soy okay so literally three tablespoons of soy sauce and then from there one nice tablespoon of oyster sauce give that a really good mix okay now the flavors in there are incredible i like to get this sauce made up literally two or three days before it just sits in the fridge again we're doing it with the noodles over chicken and fish equally delicious but pandora man look that fat now is coming out the bacon okay i want to see that nice crispy texture on the bacon really important just take off the heat for a moment okay once that bacon starts to get really nice and crispy lay it nice and flat in the pan check the seasoning okay check the flavor wow that's delicious it's sharp i'm gonna just increase that sort of soy richness darkness in there and let it down a little bit okay now yeah that's good that's very good it's nice and thick not too watery but every mouthful is packed with that wonderful asian flavor now bacon once you take off the heat and let it relax the oil starts to sort of seep out but the crispiness that bacon stays really nice and crisp so eggs always crack on a flat surface into the pan straight off and in pan down please oscar back onto the heat but look take the tip of the whisk and just break that up okay break that up off the heat and separate those eggs so it's almost like a sort of fast track scrambled from there take your noodles and lay those noodles over those eggs and bacon the smell is incredible i'm telling you now from there we want to get a bit of texture and color on those noodles press them down into the eggs and the bacon so good don't worry about breaking it up yet from there a little seasoned together spice over that'll give the heat on the noodles okay now we go back onto the heat okay and start caramelizing that really nicely now the asian greens okay these don't need blanched or part boiled just slice them nice and thinly okay because the thinner they are the quicker they cook and this is like a sort of nice big bok choy the stems are delicious the leaves are really tasty you can hear those noodles sort of cracking away once you get down to the tip over and then bang look spread that out this is gonna send uncle roger into overdrive trust me now from there correct the seasoning now i know i'm using a frying pan and he loves the wok but trust me i've been to indonesia more times than he has let me tell you the sauce go over and literally just dab a touch of that sauce in there i'm gonna whack up the heat now okay crank up the heat to get some flavor and texture on there next large spring onions again slice and just go at an angle okay why and they take on more source and b they look great in terms of presentation now hear those noodles that's what you want honestly lift them up and they go in on top beautiful think what's at the bottom the eggs then we had that beautiful bacon now the noodles and then finally some coriander just turn that round okay chop it once that's the secret chop it once keep the flavor in okay and then finally we need some freshness in there some bean sprouts and all you do is literally just plant those sprouts over there time please four minutes to go whack up the heat a touch of salt and now we start mixing okay beautiful here we go i'll give that a really good toss and look we got just pan down please oscar just check this out got that crispiness in the bacon the bacon has stuck to the noodles the noodles stuck to the eggs and all of a sudden it's starting to form this

Pre-order your...",2022-11-25 22:16:02.926159, keeping it simple in the kitchen doesn't mean you can't have amazing food that not only looks incredible but tastes fantastic too my first recipe is so easy it removes the stress from cooking and is a pleasure to make chili beef lettuce wraps cooking should never be a chore the more you cook the more confident you become that way you actually start to enjoy it and that's the key to good cooking have a bit of fun along the way this is minced beef and minced pork the pork needs to sit in there otherwise the beef's gonna dry out it's really important to season the mince before you cook it pan nice and hot touch of olive oil mince in breaking up like that really helps to sort of separate it so we can fry it off with a lot of color with your spoon just go through and start breaking that up the most important thing to remember is mint is made up of cheap cuts brisket belly short rib so it needs help and frying off the mince for color it's so important if this pan wasn't hot your mince is going to boil there's a horrible gray color on there and there's no flavor on your mince taste a little bit [Music] tastes delicious it's seasoned beautifully see how crispy it's going take it much further than you ever taken mints before nice and crispy smells incredible draining it it's crucial it keeps the mints nice and crispy and you get rid of that excess fat that's lovely now just wipe out the pan then wash it low gas now we're going to add texture to the mince finely chopped chili ginger garlic and spring onions spring onions give this sort of mince a really nice freshness because it just gives that crunch nice and thinly now i'm gonna fry off the chilies the ginger the garlic first sesame seed oil teaspoon only in garlic chili ginger in fry that off nicely the sesame seed oil just lifts up the whole flavour brown sugar that starts to really caramelize the chili the garlic and the ginger mince in now my fish sauce that gives it the saltiness you can see now why it's so important to get that mince really crispy because nothing's going soggy staying really crispy fresh lime that makes the mince fragrant and then lime juice roll it and squeeze that in there [Music] incredible i've got the salty i've got the heat i've got the sweetness now i've got the acidicness as well and then finally my spring onions in right at the last minute so i've got crunch in there as well smells amazing literally cook the mince now with sort of 30 seconds to go gas off and take it out looks incredible smells so inviting [Music] to go with the chili beef i'm making a simple sweet and spicy dipping sauce so everyone can dress the crispy mince to their own taste dipping sauce little teaspoon the brown sugar soy sauce gives it a nice sort of dark rich color sesame seed oil a tablespoon and just top that up with a tablespoon of olive oil that stops the sesame seed all becoming too rich a teaspoon of fish sauce and then a touch of chili leave the seeds in again i want the heat in that sauce so impressive an amazing show off center piece lime juice in in the coriander chop it through once give that little mix up just check the seasoning that's lovely nice and rich now the lettuce i'm going to use baby gem because it's really nice and durable and sort of quite strong so you just sort of sit these nice trimmed lettuce leaves around now the exciting part serve take your lettuce up spoon in your mince and then a little touch of dressing just a little drizzle nice and that's the secret of having good easy relaxed food is that you just help yourself food that looks and tastes a million bucks doesn't have to be complex this dish is as fun to cook as it is to eat [Music] mushroom and leek pasta this fantastic fast and simple pasta dish made with everyday ingredients just goes to prove you can eat good food whenever you want really important put the water on first so you can just have it gently simmering away ready for the pasta while the water comes to the boil start the sauce by slicing mushrooms first off fingers one in front two behind up and down add olive oil to a hot frying pan [Music] i want that nice color on the mushrooms off the heat literally 10 seconds and when you toss something really important you get all the ingredients at the end of the pan push down and pull back that noise that's that's all the water coming out of the mushrooms next finely chop a fat clove of garlic then prepare your leeks just take your knife and go down through the center turn it over and again into quarters see all that opening up and then just rinse the top of that to get rid of any potential dirt or sand it just breaks up into nice little quarters add all that leek into those mushrooms beautiful and now the secret is to get rid of that water inside the leek as it cooks down all the water's gone you just left that really nice intense flavor garlic's got nice and crispy now we're gonna add a touch of chicken stock in there beautiful lasagna sheets just gonna drop the sheets in to the water lasagna sheets are an unusual choice for a dish like this but they work brilliantly although any type of pasta you've got in the cupboard will do and just twist that pan that stops any pasta actually sticking to the bottom of the pan chicken start to reduce down by half and it's almost delayed the bottom of the pan basically washed all that wonderful flavor off turn the gas down and add a couple of tablespoons of cream this just enriches the dish bring it back up to the bowl and let it simmer for three to four minutes now the secret with the pasta is just taking it out a little early so you've got that nice texture hold up the sheet and just nip it and you can feel your fingers in the center it's ready turn the sauce down and lay these beautiful sheets of lasagna into that sauce i'm just going to turn the gas off now and let the pasta sit in there and absorb that amazing sauce finish with chopped fresh tarragon it's a delicious herb it goes brilliantly well mushrooms and leeks just let that sit and almost sort of infuse to serve i'm making a quick bruschetta by toasting fresh chipata bread two nice slices drizzle that in olive oil a little bit of garlic just rub the bread the crust as well crust is what really takes that garlic now pan for the bread little touch of olive oil as it starts to smoke bread in [Music] but look at the pasta now it's been stained by that amazing sauce to serve i want a nice spoon of my mushrooms leeks and cream then i'll take my pasta just twist it and let it sit on top that tarragon has just lifted everything bread on and that's the beauty about something so simple that can be done in 20 minutes with everyday ingredients a stunning pasta dish adding easy and versatile dishes like this to your repertoire is what cooking at home is all about so you can always make great tasting food at the drop of a hat i flavor packed lamb with fried bread whether i'm cooking high-end dishes or rustic dishes trust me it all has to be impressive so this lamb dish proves that you don't have to spend a fortune to create delicious food first off put the pan on this is a lamb steak and it's cut just above the leg just here because you can see that delicious bone running through the center and that's full of marrow so that just gives the lamb a nice added sweet flavor just take your knife cut through each end this stops the lamb steak from buckling so therefore it cooks evenly and colors beautifully salt and pepper lamb needs quite a lot of help with the pepper so be quite generous with the pepper and just pat that down the pan is just under smoke on the outside now put the oil in get that pan really nice and hot because this is a cheap cut so i'm depending on the color of the lamb steak to really sort of impart a lot of flavor that's the noise you want to hear if you can't hear that noise don't drop the steak in put a little bit of garlic in there not chopped garlic just whole cloves the garlic lightly crushed don't even waste time peeling them in tongs lift up a bit of fat around the back that's the top of the leg tilt the pan and let all that fat render rendering is a chef's term that means melting the fat it works brilliantly when you're cooking a rib eye as well cut it over that color there beautiful now it looks like an expensive cut and we've got that nice even sear all over as it's cooking just tilt the pan and vase and basting the lamb steak just means you're sort of adding all that nice scented garlic olive oil back into the lamb [Music] now take the lamb out let the lamb rest [Music] now for the perfect rustic crouton so this bread's quite firm a couple of days old just slice it straight down the center dice it up put it into a bowl season it beautifully [Music] from there i'm gonna add some milk sounds strange adding milk to crouton but it just gives it that nice rich creamy texture and just let that milk sort of absorb into the bread while that's soaking i'm gonna make the dressing go back to that initial garlic that was in the pan look at that beautiful into the pest and water anchovies anchovies go brilliantly well with lamb i want that nice salty vinegary flavor and a bit of kick some capers the little baby cats very sweet now just pound that to a nice paste that smells incredible next some dijon mustard a nice teaspoon and a half in a little bit of red wine vinegar two tablespoons and then our extra virgin olive oil now it's got that heat in there got a nice roasted garlic a real hearty chunky vinaigrette that sort of seeps into that lamb some fresh parsley crunch up the parsley delicious flavor parsley in nice now get your pan hot for the croutons olive oil in the pan grab the croutons and squeeze all that excess milk out not too hard i don't want them dry and in and then just fry them and the milk inside these croutons give it a nice spongy creamy delicious flavor that's the color i want nice now take them out and lightly drain them a little bit kitchen roll onto the board out [Music] to plate them just take this amazing vinaigrette and spread it get those croutons listen to them like little boulders hitting the play the lamb let's sit that on next one on the rest of the croutons on now use all those little bits and my chef in paris would kill me right now if you saw me using those because they're the ugly scraps that customers should never see but but they're the best bits croutons on and then just drop that sauce on all those little bits of the lamb and there that is a perfect way of taking a cheap cut into the premier league of dishes you

Easy and done in under 10 minutes, this tagliatelle with...",2022-11-25 22:16:02.926159, [Music] right let's be honest pasta is definitely a big midweek staple in the ramsey household and for me there's nothing better than a delicious hearty one so this one is all about turkey leeks tagliatelle finished with the most amazing sage breadcrumbs trust me it's going to be a big hit in your household right oscar come in let's go through the ingredients pan down pan down fresh taco telly that takes about 90 seconds to cook ground turkey is a great alternative from beef a lot lean as you can see there's harlene fat in there beautiful baby leeks shallots lemon garlic touch of chili bread crumbs and of course fresh sage right capitan let's have 10 minutes on the clock right first things first get that pasta water boiling and sometimes when it's not boiling get some salt in there and that will increase the actual speed of that water boiling really important a rolling boil pans on nice and hot now the secret here is to get some really good color on that turkey okay it's a very sort of lean no fat so we've got to be careful because we need some butter and olive oil in there to give it that nice rich flavor first off shallots sliced in half and i'm going to use a couple of slots because leeks also come from the onion family take off the ends okay and then from there literally just slice down now flat on the surface and slice don't go too thin because you want this temperature quite high and if the pan's super hot the actual shallots will burn nice now from there top and tail your leeks that basically means just take the top and the towels off okay and again nice long strands too fine and they'll burn okay i want those leeks literally spreading through the pasta top and tail make sure they're very very clean and again on an angle and just slice through as this cooks it will sort of open up across and all those leeks will start sort of almost shredding get that pan nice and hot okay roll around and in with the shallots and our leaves now roll that over again i like to use all the pan so spread that out that helps to caramelize let's get some color on those leeks a little touch of salt a little touch of pepper and just a touch of this early stage of chili that'll give it a little bit of a lift now from there start off with the garlic again quite nice chunks of garlic if the caramelized it's fine okay if you slice them too thin again they're going to burn so keep them quite chunky and you'll see the way that they caramelize in the pan on top of the leeks they're sort of they taste better sometimes when you slice the garlic super thin it gets very bitter now touch more salt be generous with the olive oil okay and now i'm gonna start adding my butter okay why the butter's gonna give it a bit of richness okay little flecks of butter all the way down i want color i want caramelization and more importantly i want the water out of those leaks gas up high get your pan ready for your breadcrumbs just put it on a nice ring and just keep it nice and hot okay but look at that down there pan down oscar please time three minutes gone now whack up the gas once we've got that color give that a little toss so beautiful flatten it again and now we're gonna add the turkey okay and all we do is just break this up and hit it around the side of the pan and you'll see that we're gonna get some really nice color on that turkey and that's why i added the butter and the olive oil because there's no fat in this turkey okay so it's super lean so it is semi-healthy but we finish it with a touch of cream to bring it together to give some richness so open up the turkey and almost sort of run it through your fingers and just sort of sprinkle it it's ground turkey and sometimes i put it in the freezer for five minutes before i use it because it helps get it really nice and crumbly okay and look you can see now i've got the leeks caramelizing underneath i've got the garlic and the shallots working a touch of chili in there and i haven't just put one big clump of ground turkey in there now from there quick wash the hands so my vegan friends don't complain season the top of that salt and pepper okay and then look get your lemon and just zest that lemon over that turkey that's going to give it a little bit of freshness for the lightness okay but underneath have a look at these leeks okay so beautiful now i give that a toss and look i'm getting that color in there now beautiful really beautiful so don't worry about adding that olive oil and that butter we need that little bit of fat in there and it stops the turkey from going dry good halfway right okay give that a really good toss now keep that nice and flat okay the seasoned beauty that chili's coming through the turkey is nice and separate and it's taking on those leeks there's onions and there's garlic and then from there we'll put my pasta in okay now this is a thin taglatelli you can use usually penne papridelli but this is a beautiful quick and easy literally 90 second pasta bring it up immediately i like to season the top and the bottom of the water i'll explain why in a minute shake the pan stop it from sticking to the bottom and then we've got this nice salted rolling boil water and then i like to season it on top as well so that is really nicely seasoned gas nice and high right one pan two pans working now we're gonna get the bread crumbs working i start off with a touch of olive oil to stop that butter from burning then i put my butter in so it goes nice and frothy and then as it starts frothing up okay i season that butter and add my breadcrumbs in there and that's gonna fry them to get nice and crispy a little bit of sage roll up the leaves and just slice the sage nice and fine in she goes and you'll see that really nice light flavoured sort of spicy crispy breadcrumb on top of the pasta the water's re-boiling check the pasta again i'm going to be using some of that pasta water still a little bit al dente another 30 seconds now look at the leeks look at the turkey what i'm gonna put in there now to bring this together there's about a couple of tablespoons of cream gas still nice and hot up high bring that up to the boil and look i don't want it too cloy i don't want it too heavy but just coat it with the cream and now my bread crumbs pan down pan down please just have a look at that look they're frothing away and going really nice and spicy a touch of chili in there some fresh parsley rice at the very end okay in with those breadcrumbs it also helps to cool down that butter and it gives a really nice creamy texture now look at that that's where i want to go the cream has brought it together okay all i do now is get my pasta bring your pan over to your pot lift don't drain all that water off okay grab your pasta i'm adding a touch more water that water's now packed with the starch rolling around and this is where the magic happens i've still got the heat in the pan we'll go back on the heat a touch more water and look beautiful now so important that we do not put too much cream in there when you look at this dish now it doesn't look like there's hardly any cream in there time please good and now i've got that nice creamy texture the last 30 seconds of the cook takes place in the pan so don't cook the pasta completely inside the water take it out earlier and have the confidence to finish it in that sauce and look from there we come into finishing into the center it's nice and spicy with that chili the turkey is caramelized the leeks have melted the garlic is sweet and then literally on top at your breadcrumbs and they are so crispy and you just literally drizzle that crunch on top and there you go that is a beautiful delicious incredible turkey pasta to all of you thank you for watching ramsey intent if i went too quick i apologize but slow it down now don't forget to pick up

#GordonRamsay #Cooking #Food...",2022-11-25 22:16:02.926159, [Music] right one of my favorites it's a tangy fruit salad and it's for breakfast would you believe start off with a chili now give it a little rub so you can hear those seeds being released get your knife and come all the way down turn it over and just slice it into four and then finely chop that chilli i want this salad slightly hot so i'm going to use all the chili for half the seeds the seeds are where the heat is so the less you use the milder your dish nicely chopped next one of my favorite pastes tamarind paste this is quite tart quite sour but it's a wonderful compliment to the sweetness of the fruit and it goes brilliantly well with a chili palm sugar and this is where it sweetens up the dressing because it enriches it then the zest and the juice of a lime cut it into quarters and then twist the lime to maximize and all that juice out now to finish that dressing off some toasted peanuts get the pan nice and hot a little touch of salt that'll help dry roast the peanuts even quicker make sure you get a really nice dark color on those peanuts because it will really transform that dressing to crush your roasted nuts the mess free way simply wrap them in a clean cloth and use a rolling pin or a pan to bash them crush that's the hard bit done now for the fruit and here's an easy way to prep a pineapple pineapple take off the top take off the bottom and stand it up use a corner knife and follow down basically like shaving the pineapple don't worry about these little spikes there the secret behind doing it this way is not losing half the pineapple there's nothing wrong with a few brown bits it's all good fiber slice the pineapple in half and then slice down each quarter slice across and chop delicious pineapple chunks next apples and pears diced then to give a lovely fresh light note the seeded cucumber i don't want the seeds in the fruit salad the cucumber seeds will make it very watery and dilute the strength for that wonderful chili in there cucumber in for some sweetness delicious mango just slice it nicely get your dressing and just drizzle that over the fruit salad in the secret of a good fruit salad is not drowning in the dressing but really make sure that you've got that nice coating on all the fruits don't worry about just having for breakfast because this is the kind of tangy fruit salad you can have for lunch a healthy snack in the afternoon but it transforms a traditional fruit salad into something really delicious spicy fruit salad with a kick of chili trust me it's an incredible breakfast and a guaranteed pick me up in the morning there's something very scottish about porridge it's that kind of sort of great start to the day my father used to say porridge needs salt and salt only it separates the men from the boys didn't really like it who was insistent salt puts hairs on yours i used to sneak a couple of sugar lumps from cafes and put them in my porridge without him watching these days my porridge has much more flavor than just salt it's packed with fruit nuts and spices add vanilla seeds to porridge oats or oatmeal really important just to rub the vanilla through the oatmeal makes it nice and fragrant now a little teaspoon of cinnamon makes it spicier and then nutmeg [Music] already that smells incredible i quite like making this up week at a time and jack absolutely loves it now whole almonds now if you don't like that kind of crunch running through the porridge you can chop these up or blend them to a powder but i quite like the sort of texture hazelnut nuts incredibly good a really nice crunch keep your vanilla pod in there as well that just gives it even more lift and of course once it's baked just pull it out instead of sugar i'm adding sweetness with fruit fresh pears and raisins cranberries are great as well chopped apricots as well dried apricots in there dried mango i love dried fruit next pour in a pint of milk and mix this can be done the night before left in the fridge and then a couple minutes before you go to bake it add your cream now into your dish it looks quite liquid but by the time it bakes has this really nice rich crust on top and then just a nice little nutmeg on top now bake at 180 for 30 to 35 minutes then take the porridge out sprinkle on demerara sugar and grill to create a sweet golden crust and sort of glaze on top beautiful literally for three to four minutes look at that that makes me feel proud to be scottish because it's perfect for a big comfort family breakfast it's rich it's sumptuous and it's just a humble oatmeal phenomenal especially in the winter my spice baked porridge with all those nuts and fruit it's a bowl full of love to start the day [Music] delicious poached pears i love pizza ready so we're gonna poach them with a little bit of chili chili never heard of that a little bit of saffron no no now pan on take off a little slice like that so they stand up nicely and then peel okay then and then the chili you hold that up and just go down yep through and open that up okay into the water seeds in as well a little bit of water and sugar what are they holes saffron is expensive but you only need the tiniest little bit a little pinch to make that water go light and golden star nice how come it's the chinese you've like sliced it at the end and it's not put in whole i want all that flavour coming out of the chili we're going to make the most amazing star in east dust sorry stars dust should get your star nice in there seed up and then in see all those little seeds yeah and then you start grinding a little teaspoon of ginger give it a nice mix thank you meg and that's gonna dust the top of the pears once they're cooked ryan get your pears drop them in there and that's what we're going to sprinkle mmm ginger that's darwinis wow the rice is that very good that's lovely isn't it so once they're cooked cool down sprinkle that over the top right have you guys got homework yes see you guys come back shortly thank you turn that down and let them fall okay thank you guys after an eight minute simmer our pears should be ready now just get your knife on put the knife through and see how easy the knife is so that means they're soft and cooked now you can leave them in that overnight two or three days all right and they just get darker and more beautiful the good thing about the cooking liquor is that you don't throw that away because you can use that again for re-poaching beautiful i mean they look impressive they smell delicious donna don't they [Music] look at the colors nice lovely isn't it colors are an amazing one and just smells delicious and then take your little star and east dust and just dust over look at that nice looking you think of the flavor and the texture of avocado rich phenomenal i want to make it a little bit more vibrant black sesame seeds a nice pinch of chili flakes i quite like it hot a touch of salt and a touch of pepper so that nice dry combination of the lemon zest black sesame seeds and the heat the chili this is light healthy quick but so tasty sourdough bread three nice chunky thick slices open them up lightly season them little touch of olive oil brings the whole crust to life rub all that seasoning in but you can use chipotle you can use a baguette but the richness from the sourdough with the silky creaminess of avocado is mind-blowing and then get the grill up to temperature and push these down go the extra mile we've all put bread in a toaster but the difference of grilling the bread this way is extraordinary that nice smoky charcoal flavor off with the gas beautiful now the avocado you've got to treat them with love respect press on the end here as your thumb softens you can tell that avocado is ripe never press here you just end up bruising it slice down until you feel that stone in the middle and then just roll around and then it's just a little gentle twist off stone and out cut them into quarters the back of your knife peel back that skin if the avocado is nice and ripe it should just all fall away slice just take your quarters fan them out and push them into the bread the ripe of the avocado the better the flavor but look for ones free from soft spots and blemishes which can suggest bruising get your lemon squeeze that will stop the avocado from discoloring and then get your crunch ready to go on top sprinkle in a very generous light way you've got the fragrance from the lemon zest the crunch from the sesame seed the heat that little chili flake which just wakes up the avocado they look expensive that for me is a delicious light start to the day avocado on sourdough toast with lemon and black sesame sprinkle you

lonely night so i've had to make some really smart adjustments and this dish has been inspired by my time in california this is an amazing cauliflower steak that will be on your table in literally 10 minutes quicker than you can say the word vegan right oscar pan down beautiful cauliflower we're going to take the steak the center cut and the rest will use for cauliflower and cheese soup puree whatever you want to do or even a cauliflower couscous but that middle steak is the money shot beautiful onions caraway seeds parsley shallots garlic dill mint sugar beautiful mustard and like i heard the provence because we're gonna make a sort of fresh salsa verde but first things first let's get that steak on let's have 10 minutes on the clock please now hot pan gas up cauliflower steak doesn't sound original but this is going to transform the way you eat cauliflower put a little mark there a little mark that side and what i'm trying to do is make sure i get that beautiful steak in the center save that for later keep that on there and look i want to come down about an inch thick and go all the way through and look that is what i want a beautiful steak now gently place that down these little bits of cauliflower trust me great for coffee and cheese and bacon etc soups purees now let's get some all in the pan okay get the gas up okay i want to give some really nice flavor to this cauliflower gently lift it up as it starts to smoke in she goes lay away from you keep that down there gotta get some color on that no color no flavor even when i'm talking about cauliflower salt cracked pepper and then let's get some aromats in there some garlic doesn't need to be peeled just literally crushed and in now gently get color on that next pan it's gonna be a dry pan i'm gonna toast our spices we've got some caraway seeds going in okay some almonds going in and this is sort of a nice sort of fragrant toast a nice seasoning and gives it a really nice sort of beautiful flavor i'm going to put a little pinch of caraway in the bottom of the pan i'm getting some color on that now give it a little shake gently lift that up you just start to see the color how do we get more color on there little knobs of butter okay that's like a really nice flavor i've got the garlic sort of working its magic from there look that smells incredible now literally lemon in lemon juice helps to keep it nice and white but also just roasting that in there the sort of lemon starts to puree and this cauliflower starts to become a little bit more fragrant i'm toasting my seeds here a flavor that smells incredible now also got the color on the cauliflower steak literally lift that up turn that over turn down the gas add a touch of water or stock in bring that back up to the boil instantly as it starts boiling put that lid on and then turn that gas down time please seven minutes beautiful now from there i'm going to take out my beautiful almonds and chloe see just let them toast and sit that's beautiful it smells incredible now for the salsa verde okay it's a very sort of acidic delicious garnish and it's almost better than the garnish because it's quite substantial i'm going to chop up the shallots not too fine okay beautifully done all the way down to the root and then look into the bowl now from there take your mint and take your dill and take your parsley and scrunch it up almost like a big fat cigar now just chop the herbs once i say once because i want the freshness left in the herb sometimes when you over chop herbs the board turns green i want the green and the flavor in the salsa verde look my board's clean look really important because when you slice something it starts to bleed and i want it bleeding sort of almost flavor coming out of those herbs into the salsa verde salt pepper and this is where it starts to go up a different level a nice tablespoon of mustard a nice tablespoon of brown sugar two tablespoons of red wine vinegar in and then the olive oil now the olive oil don't go crazy olive oil mix that up and sort of keep it quite dense and thick you never really have a salsa verde that is literally runny it's quite a nice beautiful chunky thick rich liquid and then of course your beautiful dried herbs now i know they're fresh and dried herbs in there but as the dry herbs start to sort of rehydrate inside it opens up

#GordonRamsay #Cooking #Food #Vegan...",2022-11-25 22:16:02.926159, for me the secret of a great gazpacho is over ripe tomatoes peppers cucumber a little bit of heat with a garlic we've got to leave it to marinade first peppers cut around the flat edges to minimize waste then chop the nice thing about making the gazpacho there's no set recipe because you can put it together purely all tomatoes half peppers half tomatoes i like the flavor of the cucumber in there as well that gives it that freshness the secret of a great dispatcher is the longer you leave it marinating the better the flavor so if you can get this done the night before and left in the fridge the results are stunning the green and red peppers have subtly complementary flavors and go well with ripe tomatoes start off by removing the bitter core get a little knife and just put it in where the core is and twist it around and you get this little core out i remember my first experience eating a gazpacho in spain mind blowing i've never forgotten that quarter your tomatoes keeping the juicy seeds that add so much depth of taste nice then from there cucumber just peel that the seeds i'm gonna leave in that gives it the flavor and the texture cucumber and gazpacho does exactly what it does in a pims it sort of freshens it up and makes it mouth-watering slice that in half again into quarters and chop now to give gazpacho its unique texture and thicken the soup bread and the crispy the crust the better then garlic thinly sliced next spring onions nice and roughly chopped and basil stalks and all we can use stalks and basil stalks parsley stalks tarragon stalks they have the most amazing flavor basil in and now we'll start marinating salt black pepper and a good coating of olive oil this gives it a glossy creamy flavor and the cherry vinegar that's the perfect vinegar for the gazpacho it's a strong acidic complement to the flavors and just mix it up and the smell already is incredible it doesn't look like a gazpacho but by the time this marinades and all those flavors start getting to know one another all of a sudden you've got this huge explosion of contrast now push that down in the restaurants we press the marinade down overnight a couple of big pans on top and we crush all the ingredients and then blitz it the next day the flavor is extraordinary leave all those fresh ingredients packed with goodness to marinade from half an hour to even overnight and then when you blend it it just comes together like this sumptuous rich delicious chilled soup to go with my super tasty soup i've got an ultra healthy and exciting dessert carpaccio of pineapple which is a chefy way of saying super thinly sliced it's done with a twist we're gonna have a delicious flavoured salt has to be flavored with vanilla simply scrape out the vanilla seeds and add to sea salt along with the pot to store now that basically keeps river there's no sale by date because it's salt and vanilla so so fragrant so delicious you don't need much of this fragrant salt to intensify the sweetness of the pineapple pineapple [Music] sliced peeled pineapple into wafer thin pieces it's almost like nice little discs slightly transparent [Music] once you've sliced the pineapple take the flavor to another level a light sprinkle of vanilla salt and arrange the pineapple in a flower shape [Music] it's a beautiful way of finishing a meal the fragrance other than the crunch with the salt and the vanilla salt just marinades the pineapple beautifully then scatter nutrient rich pomegranate seeds over the top to finish finely shredded fresh mint just slice them really thin and then that'll give that nice cool minty flavor pineapple my carpaccio is ready and my gazpacho has been marinating in the fridge time to blend the soup in onto your blender and start off nice and slowly blend until super fine and gloriously silky and serve refreshingly cold get your bowl and pour it in now to finish it get some fresh basil roll it nice and tight and shred it and then drop it into your bowl fresh chopped basil and then finally just a touch of extra virgin olive oil just to give that really nice additional freshness and look at that healthy and delicious gazpacho soup to me is a taste of mediterranean sunshine in a bowl followed by the wafer thin capacity of pineapple with jewels of pomegranate goodness for dessert practically all of your five a day in one incredible healthy lunch my next simple salad that's perfect for a party is green bean salad with mustard dressing [Music] for the dressing wrap a whole bulb of garlic in foil and roast it in a hot oven next add top and tail green beans to salted boiling water and cook for just a couple of minutes this is called blanching and keeps the beans deliciously crunchy [Music] strain the beans and refresh in cold water this stops the cooking process so they stay crisp and green [Music] next remove your garlic from the oven [Music] cut off the head and squeeze out all the glorious garlic which has gone creamy mellow and divine in the oven [Music] then simply add sharp white wine vinegar a dollop of dijon mustard and sweet runny honey season and pour in a good glug of olive oil then whisk [Music] add the crunchy blanched green beans and topped with toasted almonds for a lovely nutty note and crunchy texture mix well and serve [Music] heavily mustard vinaigrette with a hit of mellow roast garlic stunning green beans dressed to perfection [Music] my next salad that's great for any big bash is roasted red pepper lentil and herb salad [Music] add pre-lentils to vegetable stock along with a bay leaf and boil for 15 minutes pre lentils are perfect for sellers they have a great meaty flavor and a delicious bite for texture next chop sweet red peppers and place on a baking tray along with diced courgette drizzle over olive oil season and roast in a hot oven to assemble the salad place the drain lentils in a large bowl [Music] then add olive oil [Music] and chop some blush tomatoes take the roasted red peppers and courgettes from the oven and add along with chopped avocado as its delicious creamy flesh gives the salad a lovely contrast [Music] season then for a big herby hit chop a handful of chives and basil and add squeeze over lemon juice and mix earthy aromatic and packed full of goodness absolutely stunning so with roasted meats and fish or perfect eaten just by itself you

cut of steak you've got to let it rest you never slice this piping hot okay the minute you slice it piping hot you're gonna burst the steak and you're gonna lose all that amazing flavor now i've already got the marinade in there okay so we don't need to all the pan i've got the marinade on my plate now that i've seasoned it just a touch more each side if you want to impart some really good

#GordonRamsay #Cooking...",2022-11-25 22:16:02.926159, [Music] i've never forgotten i think it was about six years of age when mum brought this huge tray of eggy bread to the table and it was like wow mum we've died and gone to heaven start off with a slightly stale bread four or five day old loaf left over if it's a fresh bread then it absorbs too much of the egg so therefore it gets soggy you never get it fried and crisp and if you're not gonna use it for breadcrumbs eggy bread is a must in france they call it pan perdue the lost loaf now eggy bread is great on its own but serving it with stewed apples is delicious so the secret here keeping the skins on it's a lot of flavor in the skin and also it stops the apple from breaking down too quickly they get these nice chunks as opposed to a sort of apple puree [Music] now get your pan nice and hot and sprinkle a couple of tablespoons of sugar take the sugar down to a light caramel it's quite incredible how cheap it is to make this and yet it was so filling if you haven't got apples this recipe will work pretty much with any fruit you've got in don't be scared to mix a pear and an apple a banana and a pineapple just chew it lightly toss in the caramel get a little knob of butter that makes a nice toffee apple flavor really simple now you can see what's happening the apples are caramelizing but they're staying intact because the skins on the apple and the caramel has turned into this nice rich butterscotch sauce once you've glazed all the apples a couple of tablespoons of water in there bring that ball and let that cook out now the eggs three whole eggs whisk up the eggs add about four tablespoons of milk you want the egg thick and rich and then lightly sprinkle in a couple of tablespoons of sugar that sweetens up the mixture and when you start frying the bread it caramelizes it beautifully a teaspoon of powdered cinnamon that gives the bread that really nice spicy deliciousness apples are glazing beautifully and put them on a low heat and get a pan on now for the bread a teaspoon of oil that stops the butter from burning butter in as that starts frothing get your bread in it's going to be pretty quick now now you don't need the bread soaking drain and in the pan once your egg bread has browned flip it over 90 seconds each side that butter gives that nice golden brown color of that egg [Music] beautiful absolutely beautiful it's quite remarkable isn't it a couple of eggs splash of milk leftover apples and all of a sudden you've got this stunning breakfast [Music] now my apples they've all glazed beautifully get a nice spoon of that amazing juice and drizzle that over hmm wow if my mum saw me doing this she'd kill me you're getting all posh again no no i'm using a touch of iced sugar to make it look stunning and that for me takes me back to when i was six years of age and i thought i just won the lottery that is incredible thank you brett [Music] you won't get more breakfast for your buck my mum's incredibly delicious cinnamon eggy bread with quick stewed apples [Music] a delicious saffron flatbread with mussels it doesn't get any healthier than that first job the super easy saffron flatbread put the saffron into the bowl and a couple of teaspoons of hot water that starts to infuse the saffron and so you can maximize on the colour across your flatbeds to make the dough simply add plain flour a pinch of salt and pepper to a bowl and then pour in a dash of olive oil that makes the dough nice and silky and rich your saffron water you'll see how concentrated it is now and you'll need cold water then simply need to bring the dough together mop up all your flour you can see now the saffron's activated it's got that really nice color beautiful use your wrist and just knead it nicely we'll do now is smoothing out the gluten strands push and tuck in push and tuck in and each every time you do this getting softer you just sort of form like this perfect beautiful dough it smells delicious that saffron is very powerful now sit that in your bowl cover it with clint film let it rest for 10 to 15 minutes this relaxes the dough making it easier to roll and gives it time to infuse with the saffron i'm gonna cut that into three and then roll them nice and thinly now lightly flour the surface and then just bring that to like a perfect ball on the board once you've got that nice ball your rolling pin and just roll it out now it doesn't get any simpler than that and just lightly flour that on top a little salt cooking the flatbread is easy just pop in a hot dry pan and they're ready in minutes as it hits the pan it starts the blister she's ready for turning beautiful get the color on there now you want it nice and crisp almost blistering on both sides because it's nice and thin it's cooked once browned on both sides just cool on a rack flatbread's done now onto the mussels now the secret behind cooking great muscles is in the speed you cook the key is to chop and prep your ingredients before you start cooking first thing pancetta i want it quite chunky if you can't get pancetta i always like to use a sort of streaky bacon because i want to sort of render all that flavor at the streaky bacon now tomatoes garlic and chili cherry tomatoes they're just going in whole the garlic just crush the garlic so all that flavor comes out chilli i want some heat in here that's everything prepped now to get it cooked little touch of olive oil pancetta in pancetta takes moments once it's brown and crisp put your garlic chili and whole cherry tomatoes into the pan mussels go in okay and i'm using dry sherry i think it works better in this recipe than white wine which is classically used at this stage then oregano finely chopped stalks and all i'll go on and then just give that a little mix and we'll see those muscles start to open lid goes on you've got to lock in that flavor got to lock in that heat the muscles will take four to five minutes to steam in the meantime cut your flatbreads into strips crispy and crunchy now the mussels wow that is incredible my goodness me [Music] now that is one lunch i definitely don't want to miss healthy and delicious doesn't get any better than that incredible steamed mussels with saffron flatbreads made in minutes and packed with protein and vitamins this is one fast food meal that really is healthy [Music] line of venison one of my favorite meats slightly gamey absolutely delicious it's packed with protein low in cholesterol and so it's like the rolls-royce cut is phenomenal i'll cut it into four marinade olive oil salt pepper thyme is a very sort of dainty soft sweet herb and it goes brilliantly with the rich gaminess of the venison juniper berries the flavor is almost like a sort of rich bittersweet slightly peppery flavor garlic get the back of your knife on it get the loin place it on top olive oil season leave that to marinade and that's ready for the pan cooking the venison you've got to be a lot more delicate than you were if you're cooking a fillet of beef because it's very lean hardly any fat on there hot pan olive oil keep on rolling it around it should become nice and springy and slightly bouncy and that indicates that it's slightly pink but a little bit firm in the center butter baste the venison and then just take it out of the pan and just spoon it over there leave that to sit now for the sauce we're gonna do a really nice sweet and sour pepper red and yellow pepper just stand the pepper up on its base and just cut around like we're segmenting an orange and look you've got the seeds there fit for the bin olive oil in peppers in the pan a little bit of salt and by having the skin on the peppers it doesn't allow the peppers become too soft and overcooked it keeps them really nice and robust thyme this is where it gets really exciting white wine vinegar smells amazing but it starts to glaze the peppers a couple of tablespoons of water in there you've got this really nice sweet and sour peppery vinaigrette at the bottom peppers out carved nice thick slices and look the juices coming out of the peppers a little bit of salt just glaze the venison with some extra virgin olive oil and then look venison with sweet and sour peppers done

treated myself to the most amazing bold breakfast and it started off with these beauties here murgays cheap but incredibly tasty start off with a nice hot pan mug is in it's a very spicy sausage doesn't need any help doesn't need any chili just a touch of salt and pepper you can smell the spice they're starting to release all that wonderful oil that flavor in there add a couple of cloves i'll finely slice garlic spread the garlic across the pan it instantly changes color takes on this nice dark rich golden colour now take a look at the heat out with the parsley the stalks of soft herbs like parsley and coriander can be used to impart flavor during cooking but the leaves should always be added just before serving to give maximum color and fragrance [Music] and then finish that off with my capers amazing beautiful now take your quest on they're literally 24 hours old so they're crispy on the outside and just slice off the lid this recipe is a great way to use up any leftover croissants from the day before i used to cringe when i saw the french cooks throw away croissants i used to cry thinking oh my god any idea what you're throwing away in terms of flavor whatever you do do not wipe out that pan dunk your croissants mopping up all that amazing flavor and caramelizing the inside for that beautiful and don't forget the lids and then get your thumbs and go inside the croissant all i want to do now is just create a little pocket and just manipulate the quest on now this is where it gets exciting mix up the capers the garlic and sausages look at the color of that wonderful delicious flavored oil now some cheese but not just any cheese fontina cheese is like the number one cheese for grilling and because it's a very rich cheese you shave it thinner than you would a white truffle but it gives a really nice saltiness and a light smokey flavor a little touch of pepper salt place these big boys on the tray literally 30 seconds on the grill here we go nice crisp packs full of flavor now top them and that for me it's almost like being back in paris except this time i don't have to share them with the french my ultimate big and bold breakfast murgies and fontina stuffed croissants a great way to start the day that is the rib eye we've had that in the fridge not wrapped so it sort of almost air dries and it intensifies the flavor gross so much quicker and there's less water in the beef for me the only downside to perfect roast dinner is the fight about who washes up afterwards so meg and i are going to avoid that by cooking everything in one roasting tin starting with the spinach and mushroom stuffing [Music] let's do it with a salt and pepper please good girl some of your left shoulder left shoulder thank you in with the garlic and the mushrooms to toss the pan you push down and pull back down and push back off you go take your time push it down and flip very good that's it push down nice that was lovely and again nice i'm gonna drop let's see well done well done well then right we're gonna sort of make a little well a little touch of butter in the middle now we need to start putting the spinach in the middle piece so you can push that down spinach is cold so you're not gonna burn yourself be confident in the pan toss it and you'll see it wilting and disintegrating away wow who would have thought all that spinach could fit in this pan because it's a very delicate leaf it sort of cooks so quickly put this all on your board now and then i just want you to go and give that a nice chop then when you're confident with one hand we need to pick up the other knife the other hand chop it nicely good now outside and come in gently good regroup and take your time yes mmm right i love that smell what is that lemon thyme lemon tan that's right so you get your little thyme stalks and you pour down you sort of strip lemon thyme in now target more tastes brilliant with the beef fantastic with chicken and fish roughly chop the tarragon and i sprinkle the fresh breadcrumbs so the breadcrumbs almost sort of bring the stuffing together next we're gonna get an egg yolk now with the beef this is the exciting part slice with the bone and then come inside and go two thirds of the way down hold that open for daddy salt and pepper and then look we pack our stuffing in there this is amazing it's incredible now just gently hold out there like that okay yeah i'll see you tomorrow what tying string around the rib will keep it all together during roasting not too tight if we tie it too tightly what happens the stuffing will come out that's right that's ready for roasting but we're gonna protect it and sit it on a trivet so trivet basically is almost like a sort of little little bed a little bed that's right if you want to enjoy these delicious roast vegetables at their best make sure you remove them from the hot oven after 35 minutes and reheat before serving with your beef now a little mix for the top a couple of teaspoons of mustard powder in salt a couple of tablespoons of olive oil mix that in i'm gonna pour my mustard powder over the beef so this forms a really nice glaze my one pot roast dinner goes into a hot oven 15 minutes at 230 degrees then down to 170 degrees for another two hours for a delicious twist on traditional yorkshire puds i'm gonna lace mine with fresh horseradish [Music] start with plain white flour in a bowl and crack in the eggs adding only half of your milk at this stage makes it much easier to whisk all the lumps out and if like me you like your puddings a little lighter and crispier add a dribble of cold water and add salt to season when you're happy your batter is lump free whisk in the remaining milk peel and grate horseradish and add a handful to the mix we can leave the batter to rest while we get the meat from the oven that is beautiful and this is where you really need to let it rest how long would you say to rest it for um i like to rest the meat for at least 20 minutes just the right amount of time for us to whack up the oven and to get our yorkshire puddings in i love using the rich dripping but best of all is a healthier option to get the fluffiest yorkshires your tray and fat must be piping hot for best results take your jug of batter to the oven and pour the mixture in there it takes just 15 minutes for our yorkshire puds to puff themselves up and turn a delicious golden brown lift that up place that onto the board parsnips parrots you can see why we kept them in halves they've got all that flavor one beautiful big slice for daddy one for maggie and then on the side it's stuffing the stuffing a bit that's the best to die for now fantastic yorkshire they're amazing aren't they beautiful mm-hmm that's been my daddy i met one that's for me beautiful roast beef with a twist wow [Music] these are my odyssey river beef with horseradish spiked yorkshire puds am i gonna help with some pickling please oh definitely no you love pickles right love pickles um favorite pickle what is it i like pickled onions we're gonna do pickled celery mm-hmm it's a nice little snack and great for planned ones great for salads first thing we need to pick the celery for me so you see where the next one's gonna be it's in there yeah okay i'll figure it out but i'm hungry today is this all we're having for dinner jack come on i wouldn't do that too you know that there's more coming now because we're pickling it we want to sort of make it look a little bit more attractive so we go around like that okay on an angle so when you pick all the food does it does it preserve it it's exactly what it does but also gives it a really nice salty soury flavour yeah okay now splash of water and then with the sugar nice okay so got to bring that up to the bowl and sort of create almost like a little syrup yeah okay little teaspoon of peppercorns in mustard seeds in quite generous on the mustard seeds that gives a bit of sort of spice now those you must know cloves excellent cloves in now touch of salt no okay so from there white wine vinegar now in order for all that to actually pickle you need to boil it so by boiling it okay it brings all the

that straight away can't wait to dig into it at dinner aren't they delicious yes we'll leave that to cool down our pickles are ready and cooling now to marinate the chicken on the fried chicken traditionally it's always gonna be done with the dark meat the brown meat so you got that nice sort of uh drum here and this bit that thigh cooking on the bone as well keeps it even more moist so first things first salt pepper please from there famous buttermilk buttermilk in it's brilliant for marinating the chicken if you can put this buttermilk over your chicken the night before the more it tenderizes the chicken and starts to sort of really relax the chicken and puts a really nice sort of creamy soury flavor in there so might stick that in the fridge for us please and we'll start the dolce de leche biscuits nice the argentinians call these shortbreads alfa jorge and they're the favorite sweet treat on the streets of buenos aires they're light crumbly shortbread biscuits sandwich with gloriously golden caramelly dolce de leche sauce for the shortbread beat together softened butter granulated sugar and beat until light and fluffy add one egg [Music] slice vanilla pots scrape

sauce [Music] finish with a dusting of icing sugar [Music] delicious my dessert and pickles are ready the buttermilk should have worked its magic on the chicken all that's left is to fry it now we're gonna roll the chicken out of the buttermilk into the flour so that's why it gets nice and crispy and blistery on the outside okay cool so what we've got to make sure because the flour is the last coat yes this is nicely seasoned yeah okay so salt and pepper in there nice and this is smoked paprika so that gives it a little bit of sort of uh maybelline yeah yeah spice that's right a little bit

#GordonRam...",2022-11-24 22:16:02.926159, i love the indulgence in this dish if i was doing this for the kids i'd scrap the vodka and just do like a virgin mary but it's a bit of a grown-ups dish now pan nice and hot splash of olive oil onions in seasoning touch of salt and pepper garlic be nice and generous with your garlic it's not just your average tomato sauce it's a royal stunning tomato sauce and you're in for a big treat your onions and garlic the tabasco that will give that really nice lift little pinch of celery salt spice that up with worcester sauce it instantly colors the tomatoes goes brilliantly well with a celery salt tabasco and that nice caramelized garlic a little light sprinkling of sugar all the worcester sauce has reduced down we've got this nice sweet spicy sticky garlicky onion base glaze with a couple of spoons of vodka in lovely chopped tomatoes in little touch of water look at the color on that sauce check the seasoning that's delicious bring that up to the boil and cook it out six to eight minutes reduce it down slowly turn down the gas and let that simmer with my sauce simmering i can move on to a delicious breadcrumb topping to dress my linguini i'll fry off my breadcrumbs get them nice and crispy but don't put too much oil in there otherwise the bread will just absorb it they become greasy beautifully season them and they go really nice and golden brown 30 seconds before they come out flat leaf parsley roll that through your breadcrumbs and that is gonna finish the linguine on top you can hear how crispy they are before i cook the linguini i'm gonna make the chili butter that will flavor my lobster get your chili and slice it i want to take advantage of all those seeds chili in a touch of salt a nice clove of garlic here's some parsley [Music] start breaking that down but i'm looking for a lovely garlic chili paste exactly like that now don't overdo it with the butter herb butters are a great way to flavor fish and meat they can be used as a stuffing in dishes like chicken kiev or added towards the end of a dish as a delicious glaze lobsters they're already cooked so firmly place the lobster flat on your board there's a little crisscross here line there and line going across put the point of the knife in and just push through the head turn the lobster around cut through the lobster snap the legs off snap the claws off just get the back of your knife crack them spread that beautiful butter on go into the heads as well and then the claws take off bits of the shell and get little bits of butter in there this can be done way in advance for me the longer that chili butter sits on top of that lobster the better the flavor especially when they hit the grill while my lobster firms up in the fridge i can finish cooking my linguini water brought up to the boil seasoned nicely and a little touch of olive oil now linguine in first that's going to take the longest eight to ten minutes in as linguine starts softening at the bottom just gently turn that around always wait the linguine is nice and soft that way you don't break those nice strands give that a good mix get your lid back on [Music] and bring that to the ball rapidly after eight to ten minutes my linguini should be perfect you want it al dente slightly firm not too chewy absolutely spot on drain that into a colander shake a little bit of water from the pasta into my sauce and she goes start twisting the linguini around i want that bloody mary spicing up the linguine always hold up the center of the pan first and place it onto the plate let go of that nice big lump by doing this you'll get a mountainous pile of spaghetti with more body then generously cover that your crispy breadcrumbs absolutely beautiful last but not least i need to cook my chilled herb buttered lobsters on a smoking hot griddle that butter's gone really nice and firm so the idea is snapping that down and grilling the smell of that chili and

smell is incredible [Music] now get that on [Music] you can understand why it is proper special occasion food because that is mind blowing griddled lobster with chili and garlic butter serves with a

disaster on the big day two as well as tasting phenomenal they have to be easy to serve so you can relax and enjoy yourself three when you're out to impress food needs to look great too my first recipe fits the bill perfectly stuffed lamb with spinach and pine nuts stuffed meats are perfect for special occasions they look impressive taste amazing but more importantly they are so simple to do pan on for the stuffing it's a saddle of lamb basically a sort of rolls-royce cut perfectly shaped and it suits stuffing to an absolute tea for the stuffing finely chop an onion garlic nice thin slices oil in onions and garlic in [Music] salt and pepper make sure the stuffing is beautifully seasoned so it helps to season the inside of the lamb now we've got the color on those onions we're gonna throw in some pine nuts and that helps to give a bit of a texture here's where it starts getting really exciting spinach in and just lay the spinach over the pine nuts it looks like a lot of spinach that's going to condense and disappear almost instantly there's so much more flavor in spinach when you saute it as opposed to steaming it or boiling it gas off look at that now to bring that together no eggs no breadcrumbs crumpled feta over the spinach feta cheese adds a beautifully salty sharp and creamy flavor what this does it brings that stuffing together now open up the lamb keep those little fillets to the side that's the channel that we want to stuff so i want to just open that up a little bit there salt and pepper lightly and before we put our stuffing in we're going to season it with sour sumac is a wonderful lemony spice that goes brilliantly with lamb and you can get it in most big supermarkets and it sort of cuts through that thick rich sweetness of the lamb open up that lamb there take a spoon if you're preparing this for the day ahead then let the stuffing cool down it's inevitable when you start rolling it and tying it something's gonna squeeze out so load up the ends take these beauties these little fillets and just support that stuffing and sort of increase that beautiful tunnel and then from there over there and bring that towards you and then roll like i said some of the stuff is going to come out now we've tied it first off around the side and don't worry about some flash butcher's knot just tie it one in the middle you can get butcher string from your local butcher or at cookware shops i got two ties go too thai it just forces all that stuffing out of the lamb when it's in the oven nice now we just season the top of it the joint to make sure all the skin gets seasoned now you think normally that just goes in the oven like that that's how my mum would do it but get your tray onto the gas oil in it really nicely colored none of your stuffing is coming out the sides really important look at that color beautiful it does kick start the roasting process gas off into the oven cook for 45 to 55 minutes depending on how pink you want your lamb lift the lamb out of the fat to rest resting it raised up in the tin will stop it cooking but not cool it down too quickly and means you won't lose any of those lovely juices next i'm making a simple but sophisticated accompaniment for the lamb top and tell the cucumber peel it cut the cucumber into three and just core taking out all that it's just sort of watery seedy and it spoils the flavor slice the cucumber cucumber in really nice way of making a cheap and cheerful cucumber look glamorous we're gonna dress that cucumber with a nice fresh yogurt couple of tablespoons next some fresh mint dressing a touch of salt a touch of pepper and then pomegranate molasses that just sweetens it up finish that with lemon mix that up lamb it's rested carefully take off the string and then just gently pull them back straightened edge knife that's going to cut through that crispy fat on the outside instantly i tied it purposely so i can get my portion control from the lines hold it nice and firmly look at your line where the string was and look this one is going to be amazing lay and down just in those two slices there it proves that stuffing meat is for special occasions because that is a saddle of lamb at its absolute best stuffing meats and fish not only makes them look fantastic it also gives them an extra added flavor dimension too once you've mastered the technique you'll be able to turn out dishes that will guarantee you'll have an unforgettable feast my next recipe turns what used to be a decidedly unfashionable cut off meat into the star of the dish fit to grace any table slow roasted pork belly with fennel [Music] slow roasting works better on fattier tougher and unfashionable cuts whether it's a cheek or even a neck or this amazing pork belly it's a fantastic way to transform cheap cuts into amazing melting perfection take a very sharp knife bring the pork belly towards you so you're over and you've got all that pressure and weight using the tip of the knife i'm just sort of nicking it and go across the pork belly long strokes with a knife take your time turn it 180. this time what we're doing is just sort of cutting those nice little sort of diamonds but as that starts roasting on top it starts getting nice and crispy take little handfuls of salt and just sort of rub it in bend it over and in all those cracks really helps to get a nice crisp crackling on top roasting tray getting really nice and hot take a hole over fennel to intensify flavor and to keep the meat succulent i'm braising my pork belly with strong vibrant spices and vegetables crush and peel three whole cloves of garlic and add to the fennel olive oil in fennel in i like the nice strong aniseed flavor that goes with that nice rich dense pork fennel seeds delicious star anise in and just a couple of cardamom seeds and wow they're like little bangers like little firecrackers incredible lovely fresh bay leaves get your pork skin side down just sear the top of that fat that locks in all that amazing flavor then i'm going to flip it over and get it nice and crispy and then i want fennel seeds embedded in those little cracks now some white wine the minute that white wine hits that pan you can smell that light fragrance with fennel allow the wine to bubble away and reduce until the alcohol has burnt off time that the stock now the stock goes in just underneath the skin so it roasts on top all that meat under there will be submerged because what happens in the oven the top goes crispy as anything and the stock reduces and brazes at the same time really importantly bring that back up to the ball before it goes in the oven otherwise it will never boil never get up to temperature smells incredible slow roast the pork belly at 180 degrees for two and a half hours [Music] look at that you've got that nice crispy skin on top you can see how much of the stock has evaporated put that onto the board it looks stunning to make a delicious rustic sauce with the flavour-packed contents of the roasting tray first get rid of the excess fat take a couple of slices of bread it's like a perfect sponge because you just lay that on top and drag it almost like a net and it just absorbs all that fat if you want the perfect fried bread trust me stick that in a frying pan a nice teaspoon of mustard whisk that in and then simply simmer for a few minutes before pouring into a serving jug with your pork belly always use a nice serrated edged knife you can hear that that is amazing incredibly tender that belly of pork is gonna almost melt in your mouth you've got that sweet meat under that crispy belly of pork what an amazing way to cook a very cheap cut of meat [Music] so if a tired old recipe is getting you down spice it up with fresh ideas and flavors my next recipe is an old classic roast chicken but with a simple twist it takes on a new life and it's guaranteed to impress one of the things i love about cooking and that keeps me excited after 25 years behind the stove is that there's always something new to learn every day new ingredients new techniques and new cuisines start off with the stuffing [Music] it's amazing how exciting a stuffed roast chicken can be because it keeps the chicken incredibly moist and gives a delicious texture inside the bird i'm gonna start off with cured ceriso this is a traditional spanish sausage and it's garlicky spicy incredibly meaty that gives a little bit of sort of richness to the stuffing get that cerezo in start cooking that down and getting all those oils out a little touch of olive oil in there to get it going right onions chopped add the onions to the cerezo and in a matter of seconds they'll change color as they soak up all the flavor that lovely spiciness has been stolen from that sausage now the onions smell incredible garlic garlic fresh thyme just hold it down and put your fingers on there and it's a really nice way of taking off all those nice fragrant little time flowers you can hear it crackling in the background these are cannellini beans they're waxy very soft and so delicious but very dense but for stuffing they're so robust nothing breaks down drain them off in they're going to take on all that juice as well from this freezer i'm going to season them now because they're very dense so it needs some help i mean that looks like it's a dish on its own good enough to eat now i want to sweeten things up a little bit tomatoes half dried in that sweetens up the stuffing beautiful the stuffing's ready look at the color everything looks spanish it looks delicious now stuffing the chicken i like taking off these little knuckles as the chicken cooks the skin stretches over the bone you can get a really nice drum and take off those little wingtips as well salt pepper so important now you're stuffing i'm going to go right inside the chicken push it down this really helps to cook the bird evenly because you're pushing out all the empty spaces in the carcass and take a nice large lemon push the lemon in pick up the parsley's nose pull the skin over olive oil on top salt and pepper a teaspoon of paprika sprinkle it on and then get your hands and sort of rub that in let's see what the paprika is doing to the chicken putting this like sweet spicy marinade it's not even roasted yet but it looks delicious [Music] 400 ml of white wine same quantity of water that helps the chicken to steam chicken in be generous with the time sprigs [Music] make sure the fall is folded tightly around the roasting tray so the chicken steams in the oven keeping it moist and juicy into the oven [Music] cook for one hour at 180 degrees with a foil on nice take it out and remove the full lid then give it another 30 minutes to crisp up that skin [Music] look at that it's so important to make sure you take that tinfoil off with half an hour to go beautiful pierce that open squeeze it in that delicious gravy mix that into the tray and sieve that that's really nice fragrant lemony spiced roasting juices to finish before we cut up the chicken take out amazing stuffing [Music] incredible i'd have that with chicken over potatoes any day and then just get your chicken roasting juices now to cut the chicken up hold the drum and slice straight through and there's a wonderful drum and the thigh through the wishbone off slice with the point at an angle so you can see the texture of that amazing roast chicken just take my cooking juices just want to give a really nice sort of lemony flavor over my chicken and there you go a delicious very charming stuffed roast chicken [Music] you

Pre-order your copy...",2022-11-24 22:16:02.926159, christmas morning in the ramsey household always starts with a late breakfast of deliciously creamy scrambled eggs and smoked salmon this recipe is a ramsey family tradition on christmas day smoked salmon scrambled egg and croissant it's rich sumptuous and incredibly easy to do first the croissants slice them into rounds and season them lightly with salt and pepper the secret behind a really good breakfast is in the timing i want the questions on first smoked salmon on top and then the scrambled egg put the croissants in a dry pan and toast you don't need oil because the questions have a lot of butter in them this is a great way to transform day old croissants giving them a delicious new life just start to see them toasting almost in the pan and that's the butter inside that smell is amazing almost smells like a sort of caramelized waffle absolutely delicious toast them all around both sides and then out next just get the smoked salmon and sort of twist it and let it fall over the question let it sit naturally on top of the toasted cressel [Applause] a little twist and over right scrambled eggs eggs into the pan never whip up the eggs beforehand you break down the egg too much what i want is really nice rich creamy scrambled egg eggs in no seasoning at this stage a nice generous knob of butter now from there onto the heat and all we're going to do now is stir stir and stir and stir [Music] now the butter's melting and it's giving a really nice creamy texture to the eggs it looks rich delicious sumptuous luxurious if you're very careful making scrambled egg all of a sudden it looks runny and within 30 seconds it's cooked working it all the time right after stirring i place this scraper in there take the pan off the heat and just work round the pan cleaning up all that scrambled egg that's sticking to the bottom and now look we're getting that really nice sort of creamy beautiful texture a little touch of butter in there now i'm going to start with the seasoning 30 seconds on the end salt pepper back on to the stove and a tablespoon of cream the cream actually stops the scrambled egg from overcooking cream in and then fold that in there now keep that off the heat but look at it look at that color beautiful and then finally some fresh chives [Music] that is a randy classic smoked salmon toasted croissant and a delicious scrambled egg the best start to christmas day anyone could wish for that's good making a stunning pork apricot and pistachio stuffing the day before is a great way to get ahead it's easy to do looks a million dollars and tastes absolutely delicious christmas dinner for me is not about food piled high on a plate less is more i'd rather have five or six things on a plate that tastes absolutely delicious than 10 items tasting average stuffing for instance i'd much rather put a lot more effort into the stuffing and enjoy it but eat a lot less of it first add pork mince to the bowl season with salt and pepper and mix take your grater and a bravo an apple just get the grater and grate the apple in there usually stuffing is cooked in the turkey but i'm doing mine separately so i can make in advance and get the flavour and presentation spot on now the nice thing about the apple it goes brilliantly well with the pork it makes it a little bit sweeter it also makes it a lot lighter as well which is really important next add a handful of chopped apricots which gives the stuffing another fruity note and a lovely texture the apple disintegrates but the apricots stay really nice intact nice little bite then chop a handful of pistachio nuts again i'm thinking of the build-up of textures flavor and also color pistachio's in now give that a really good mix grating some lemon zest the zest is packed full of intensely flavored essential oils which gives the stuffing a vibrant citrus thing [Music] and for freshness add a handful of coarsely chopped parsley the balance of flavors is nice and delicate and it sits beautifully with a turkey now sage and pork and apple that's the perfect marriage now i'm going to think about the presentation skills tim full a little drizzle of olive oil and then we get a really nice fragrant sage leaves the sage leaves are used to wrap the stuffing start by overlapping them it's almost like rolling a cigar but we're gonna roll it in sage leaves taste is paramount but presentation is really important too so it's worth spending a few extra minutes to get this right because it will make the final dish look amazing now a little season across the top [Music] and then take your sausage meat and we want to do now is put half it onto the plate [Music] that's what you run your finger along the stuffing this is where it takes on a completely different flavor again i need some spice in there i want a little bit of heat in the stuffing so it's exciting to eat murgays murgays are traditional north african sausages made from beef or lamb and all we're going to do now is take the sausage and lay that in the middle they're flavored with harissa a fiery chilli paste which gives them their heat and distinctive color it really does give that nice sort of wake-up call inside the stuffing if you can't get hold of merguez other spicy sausages like chorizo would work well too take the rest of the stuffing and we'll sit that on top so in cases that murgays [Music] once you've got it like that lift up the tinfoil very carefully and roll that over let the temple do the work roll it nice and tight there fingers underneath [Music] just pull that back and double check lovely look at it it's not even cooked yet and it looks delicious the ultimate christmas cracker fantastic that sage will cook and really perfume the sausage meat and you cut through to the center you've got a nice spicy sausage lovely in now roll it across twist at the ends and then from there up into the hands and you push it in and twist and turn and all that's doing is just making the perfect cylinder the stuffing can be made wrapped and stored in the fridge a day or two in advance that's the first part of my ultimate christmas dinner ready on christmas day simply pop it into the oven and cook at 200 degrees for 40 minutes [Music] sources are one of the important ways chefs add extra dimension and flavor to dishes you can use this trick at home my caramelized cranberry and apple sauce is another recipe i always cook a day in advance it packs a wonderful punch that really lifts the subtle flavor of the turkey it's simple to make and with its deep red vibrant color looks fantastic on the plate the secret behind any good christmas is in the organization and preparation anything you can get done in advance do it apple and cranberry sauce is a prime example first things first we're gonna make a really nice caramel sugar in at 150 grams of caster sugar to a pan followed by a couple of star in ease that helps to really give a nice sort of aniseed flavor to the cranberries next lightly crushed four cardamom pods this has a lovely warm spicy sweet flavor then wait for the sugar to melt and form a caramel really important have the confidence now to colour that caramel so it gets really nice and dark before putting the cranberries in [Music] [Applause] [Music] wow the smell of that caramel is amazing now cranberries in cranberries are very tart and acidic but balance with the sweetness of the caramel and apples they give the sauce a lovely dry sharp note to tell if they're fresh drop them on a hard surface the higher they bounce the fresher they are the secret now is for caramel to blister the cranberries and really start to break that down smells fantastic next core peel and thinly slice two apples and once this sauce is finished it really does help to sort of wake up the flavor of the turkey now the cranberries are starting to break down apple in smells fantastic a touch of salt and pepper that's really important really helps to balance that tartness against the acidity of the apple salt and pepper really brings it back the smell is fantastic it's a sort of sweet sour spicy nice now from there delays the pan with a touch of port around the side the glazing dissolves all the lovely sticky caramelised bits of food that are stuck to the pan and incorporates them into the sauce next add the zest of an orange and for another layer of fragrant sweetness squeezing the juice lovely then cook on a low heat for five to ten minutes to thicken but remember the sauce will become even thicker once it's cooled down now that is the right texture i don't want a runny sauce i want something really nice and thick delicious packed full of flavor perfect if you really want to get ahead this sauce can be made three or four days in advance and kept in the fridge which allows the flavors to develop even more then on christmas day simply bring it up to room temperature and serve another job done leaving you more time to enjoy this very special day [Music] this dish is another twist on tradition it gives the potatoes a lovely color and their spicy kick helps complement and lift the whole christmas meal we're just gonna do again a little twist the potatoes we do need some gooseberry uh goose fat and we're gonna do a really nice um lightly spiced roast potato okay a little chili flake really yeah chili flake just put a little bit of heat in there for the christmas lunch yup chili flake and a little bit of turmeric i can't believe you're doing roast potatoes with chili now would you be so kind just to give them a little cut cut the peeled potatoes into quarters and put into salted cold water in they go okay bring them up to the boil and simmer for around eight minutes drain and let them steam then season with salt and pepper on there and just a little teaspoon of chili flake oh no that's the sort of thing i would make for supper in a saturday night or something you know really chili flakes in add a teaspoon of turmeric turmeric is a member of the ginger family it stains the potatoes a wonderful golden color and has a lovely earthy taste next drizzle in a little olive oil and shake to coat them just let them roll around yeah that smells nice beautiful could you get me the stuffing please from the fridge put in a preheated baking tray with extra olive oil and cook at 200 degrees celsius for about 40 minutes give it a little shake to make sure they don't stick and then i'll just stick the stuffing up on top here now that will take roughly about the same time as potatoes stuffing in potatoes done nice why are you going to play with the kids i will do here okay see you shortly thank you bye [Applause] [Music] christmas dinner wouldn't be complete without brussels sprouts but when i was a child they were boiled until horribly soft i want to keep my sprouts crisp vibrant and fresh sauteed with pancetta and chestnuts these are sprouts like you've never tasted before and brussels sprouts are delicious when they cook perfectly packed with texture and the flavor is extraordinary take off the outer leaves trim the bottom and cut in half that's a big step up from the crisscross on the bottom that my mother used to do every christmas i'm cutting them in half so when i soda them they cook evenly and look it's like little baby cabbages it's so compact then blanch them in salted boiling water for two minutes [Music] now this is the most amazing pancetta lightly cured pancetta is a type of italian bacon which is brilliant for adding a lovely rich meaty flavor to dishes i want a really nice robust flavor to go with that earthy texture of the sprout it's made from pork belly and is dry cured with salt and aromatics like juniper bay leaves nutmeg dry thyme and garlic as it hits the pan that fat on top of the pancetta melts and gives the sprouts this amazing flavor after removing the skin cut into small chunks if you can't get hold of pancetta smoked streaky bacon is a good alternative now hot pan a teaspoon of olive oil give it a nice seasoning with salt and pepper as the lavender start to crisp up take your sprouts out drain them [Music] sprouts in now give that a really nice little toss then chop up a handful of chestnuts now the chestnut's sweetened with the flavor of the sprout really important that you don't put the chestnuts in too early otherwise they'll go mush and then just sprinkle the chestnuts over lovely so we've managed to turn a sort of plain jane sprout into something quite delicious you got the texture of the smoked bacon the sauteed sprout and that nice crunch and sweetness of the festive chestnut ten seconds before they come out lemon zest over now that makes the sprouts and the bacon harmonize and then just a squeeze of fresh lemon juice over the sprouts beautiful this right now is the ultimate and for me that's a really nice modern 21st century approach to cooking an old-fashioned vegetable [Music] right listen i need some help okay we're gonna make the most amazing pumpkin soup feel that's heavy it's very heavy but it is gonna be absolutely delicious right you can always tell okay if it's ripe it what does that sound like um drums that's right and if you push your thumb in there it should be just a little bit soft right at the bottom of the root right first of all i'm going to cut it in half and very carefully just cut through i'm using a french pumpkin but these versatile vegetables come in all shapes and sizes and colors at this time of year their nutty sweetness is ideal for warming soups curries and roasts wait and see what happens when we open this up wow right holly that's for you now this is where it's going to get a little bit gory okay you get your hands and you scrape the seeds out getting messy rub them together and just give them a little clean nice and gently good yeah nice look at that yuck what do you mean yuck come on holly that's it into the water now once the seeds are out we're gonna toast them in the oven as a little snack so this is a really nice way i'm not wasting anything get your fingers right in there tilly there you go [Music] once the pumpkin seeds are out score the flesh to help it roast and absorb flavor season and have a generous amount of rosemary take the garlic rub round the outside so it perfumes the inside then add a large glug of olive oil and as the garlic grows with the rosemary its sweet almost buttery nutty taste will mellow and flavor the pumpkin all the seeds done yeah almost good after the pumpkin seeds have been cleaned dry and season them ready for the oven now they're gonna roast in the oven for about 45 to 50 minutes well done good i'm waiting to smell the house in about five minutes time tray please holly so beautiful straight in right well done big question have you wrapped mummy's present yet no let's go i'll give you a hand quickly got that garlic smells amazing [Music] holly tilly where's holly she's going to a party she's going to a party oh no any boys there i don't know oh you're so diplomatic right look they are now toasted hear that right have a little taste one of those nice yeah but look at this wow that looks amazing and that is your roasted pumpkin now you put the spoon down the side okay yeah scooping out all that lovely roast pumpkin we don't waste anything hear that skin all into the center roasting a pumpkin intensifies the rich sweet flavor of its flesh which is lovely for soups but also great as a filling for ravioli or making a delicious mash with butter nutmeg and salt and pepper that's the pumpkin done now what i want you to do is get these mushrooms here and just peel them lengthways okay onto the plate okay and i'll get my onion chopped olive oil in okay nice and generous the olive oil because what this soup do really nice and velvety onions in [Music] and then scoop out that wonderful garlic that's been roasted on the pumpkin lovely a little bit of nutmeg on top of the onions onions garlic nutmeg yeah and now the pumpkin wow say that yeah and you would come in handy somewhere this little baby it's for you there you go perfect now i want you just to grate some parmesan like that for me okay just so i can start roasting off the parmesan as well so we get this really nice rich delicious pumpkin parmesan's brilliant for enriching this soup it's mellow caramel flavour and saltiness provide a lovely balance to the sweet pumpkin now what i want you to do is dip all that in there okay yeah good [Music] at that now that huh smell that roasted sort of cheesy rosemary garlicky yeah olive oily beautiful so far nothing's gone to waste we've used the whole pumpkin now i'm gonna add the stock my hand was cooked in it smells like cinnamon it doesn't doesn't it smells christmassy delicious just from cooking our ham bring that up to the boil we'll let that cook out for 10 minutes cream really important that it's boiling when the cream goes in okay you'll see the color lightening so that's gonna give it a really nice rich creamy taste okay now we're gonna study the mushrooms a little olive oil in there yeah get nice and hot we'll go first with the trumpet de la mor there you go good girl then the pier de mouton in and then finally chantel nice lovely i want to put a little bit of butter in there nothing good good girl a little bit better there nice i love the deep complex flavor of wild mushrooms but if you can't get them chestnut or filled mushrooms still deliver great taste mushrooms work really well with pumpkin because they have a warm earthy flavor that complements the pumpkin beautifully so mushrooms into the center yeah from there we get the parmesan and just peel nice long layers watch very carefully not just sit there on top on the parmesan helps to season the mushroom and really give off an amazing flavor okay we're going to blend the soup and all we're going to do is half fill the blender so the soup gets really nicely aerated now this is a bit of a naughty chef's trick a little knobber butter in there just in top so when it blends it gets really nice and smooth lid on onto the blender and we'll just pulse it on and off first nice wow and this is the moment we'll be waiting for just one side of the bowl so that's daddy's portion that this little bit is yours now a little taste low gently [Music] love that sound christmas is here mold wine is a real christmas classic but i'm going to give it a modern 21st century twist first pour red wine into a pan and gently heat now i'm gonna make a fragrant bokeh garlic basically a really nice aromatic tea bag muslin cloth absolutely perfect for this if you haven't got muslin cloth a brand new j cloth is just as good now first off cardamom pods they are incredibly aromatic and more importantly gives it a really nice dense spicy flavour next add a pinch of cloves close the dried flower buds and add a lovely pungent sweet flavour then drop in a couple of star anise which adds an aniseed nose a cinnamon stick cinnamon sticks are made from the bark of trees native to sri lanka break one in and this gives a warm sweet spice to the wine lemongrass so this makes it slightly asian here a little bit more sort of exciting but gives a really nice light twist to the wine i'm gonna do first is just press down on the lemongrass and what that does it starts to release all that oil and flavor once it's crushed just cut it over the muslin cloth once all your spices are in fold up the muslin cloth and tie tightly and look that is like a little miniature perfect chest pillow into the wine next add orange zest twist then cut the orange into wedges and pop those in too to sweeten the wine put in a tablespoon of demerara sugar next stem ginger gives the mulled wine a little bit of a sort of kick almost like that really nice sort of ginger beer aftertaste at the back of your throat finally a couple of tablespoons of the ginger syrup and then simply heat the wine gently for four to five minutes to infuse all the fantastic flavors but don't let it boil or the alcohol will evaporate and to go with that the most amazing spice nuts [Music] i love nuts so i'm using brazil's almonds walnuts and hazelnuts and then finally pistachios lovely really nice festive mix as the nuts toast they start to release their natural oils then add a couple of pinches of salt and then just let them lightly toast once the nuts start to color add half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper which is made from ground chilies then sprinkle in half a teaspoon of paprika a mild spice made from dried pimentos for sweetness and depth [Music] and now you can see the nuts absorbing all that wonderful flavour delicious finally put in a sprig of rosemary give the pan a good toss to make sure all the nuts are thoroughly coated and they're done [Music] my next recipe for panna cotta takes all the right boxes it's easy to make and has a silky smooth texture that makes it one of the world's sexiest desserts [Music] first add 250 milliliters of cream to a pan then pour in 50 mils of milk and add 50 grams of caster sugar get the sugar in early because it stops the milk and cream from boiling over give that a little stir bring that out to the bowl panna cotta which means cooked cream in italian can be flavoured with anything from vanilla to coffee to chocolate i'm giving mine a grown-up kick with a splash of rum in once the cream has come to the boil take it off the heat and add a couple of leaves of gelatin that have been soaked in cold water and squeezed dry then whisk them in and the gelatine sets the cook cream so we want that really nice sort of blemonge texture rich silky and incredibly smooth once the gelatin has dissolved pour the panna cotta straight into serving glasses traditionally it's set in moulds then turned out onto a plate but i'm keeping mine simple leave a little space on top for the glaze now set them into the fridge beautiful next the pomegranate glaze add some castor sugar to the pan and pour in pomegranate juice then simply bring it to the boil and reduce it down to the consistency of a sticky syrup [Music] in iran where pomegranates originated they use this sweet sticky syrup to flavor chicken and game birds a beautiful rich sticky glaze pour that into a jar leave that to cool down take the panna cotta from the fridge they set beautifully and they're not too firm just slightly bouncy a little bit springy on top carefully pour the cooled pomegranate glaze over just roll them around a little bit just to fill those edges finally take a bar of chocolate that's been chilled in the freezer so it's easier to use and scrape off thin shards almost like sort of chocolate gold leaf and sprinkle it on top [Music] first slice open a vanilla pod and scrape out the seeds now the flavor in those seeds is mind blowing look at it beautiful now two whole eggs in two give that a whisk [Music] next add 125 grams of unsalted butter to the mixer once the butter's soft add 90 grams of caster sugar and cream them together until they're lovely and smooth gradually pour in the beaten eggs and vanilla seeds add a pinch of salt and beat thoroughly until the mixture becomes paler [Music] then put in 250 grams of plain flour and mix until it forms a dough it should just be nice and firm slightly soft and not too wet perfect be careful because you're holding your hands for too long it starts to melt flour your hands on the board and shape the dough into a circle it's got a really nice soft sensual sexy feel really nice and creamy now roll it out to the thickness of one centimeter cut out a large circle then put it onto a baking tray lined with parchment and decorate [Music] half again just like my grandma used to make thumb in and in chill the shortbread for an hour to help it set then bake it in a medium oven for 20 minutes until it turns a pale golden color just sprinkle a little bit of sugar really nice to do when it's just come out so it's sort of it melts into the shortbread nice and generous and that's perfect for a cup of tea mid-afternoon as well as filling your biscuit tin over christmas this shortbread can easily be transformed into a great festive dessert using a hot spoon scoop out lozenges of creme fraiche and sit that on top then grate over the zest of a clementine and finish with clementine halves the tartness of the creme fraiche works with the sweetness of the clementine [Music] you

Pre-order your copy of Ramsay in 10 here - https://linktr.ee...",2022-11-24 22:16:02.926159, i don't want to spend christmas in the kitchen ignoring my family and friends when we're all finally together so i'm prepared with dishes that i can cook in advance that will last over christmas adding a glazed ham to your holiday menu is a great way to get ahead it's delicious versatile and the ultimate dish to have in the fridge for any hungry guests who drop by christmas would not be the same without a beautiful delicious honey glazed ham across that long christmas period this can get you out of jail quite easily ham salads ham sandwiches ham egg and chips this is a gammon what you do now is cook it so it becomes a ham into a pan first things first the water cover it completely so the whole gammon cooks evenly the important part now is adding flavor in there carrots in the leeks the more veg in there now the more fragrant the broth becomes once the ham is cooked that stock is extraordinary the base to a fantastic soup onion not finely chopped and then homemade ham stock is packed with flavor so it's great for making soups sauces stews and risottos plus it can be frozen so it's there when you need it pan down [Music] peppercorns lightly crush then to give it a christmas flavor i'm adding crushed coriander seeds two cinnamon sticks and four aromatic bay leaves up to the boil and then turn it down let it simmer and then skim it cooking a ham isn't hard but it does take time this two kilo joint takes two and a half hours to simmer before it's glazed and baked however it is worth it because it tastes absolutely delicious so the glaze very very simple demerara sugar madeira that sweetens the delays basically a fortified wine couple tablespoons in and then cherry vinegar again couple tablespoons honey in nice bring that out to the ball the longer you leave it on the stove the darker it becomes you want your hand really nice and dark then cook out the glaze for three four minutes that i'm happy with lovely [Music] right the gammon's cooked now onto the plate carefully snip the string nice and gently peel back get rid of the skin then crisscross it don't push too deep let the knife do the work stud it with some clothes [Music] look at it almost looks like an albino pineapple the blaze and just carefully cover start in the middle and let it work round oh god gently gently gently gently it's not even roasted yet and it looks amazing beautiful look at that half the delays over now into the oven 15 minutes [Music] it started to colour get the rest of the delays and pour that over look at it wow the more effort passion and love you show the ham now the results are tenfold look at it every five minutes out of the oven and glaze again now back into the oven now at 190 degrees we're gonna baste and roast for 35 minutes delicious next i'm going to make a pear and saffron chutney this is a fruity relish that works brilliantly with a sweet aromatic ham first things first slice the onion fry the chopped onion in olive oil without coloring it the important part about this stage is the fact that we're gonna layer the chutney with textures from onion to apple to pear and a nice little block of ginger grating the ginger so the ginger sort of disappears with the onions then add the spices a good grating of nutmeg followed by a teaspoon of cinnamon and a teaspoon of cayenne pepper to give it a kick delicious i recently spent a lot of time in india where chutneys originated and discovered that whereas british style chutneys tend to be cooked and are usually quite sweet indian ones are normally fresh spicier and quite sour next demo sugar [Music] once that sugar is dissolved the white wine vinegar all in that's going to give this really nice sort of sweet and sour flavor from there our fruit these are williams pears pear is the star of the chutney so keep it quite rustic next add chopped cooking apples their tartness gives a lovely contrast of the sweetness of the pears to give it great texture a handful of sultanas pinch of saffron this gives it a really nice depth a rich golden color saffron is the world's most expensive spice it's made from the dried stigmas of the saffron crocus flower and as a general rule of thumb the deeper the colour of the threads the better the quality and to make it lighter the zest and juice of two oranges the orange and the saffron go really well together just squeeze that in there this chutney is brilliant with ham fantastic in salads but equally as delicious with fish whether it's a roasted cod a grilled fillet of mackerel it goes brilliantly well bring that up to the ball cook that out for 15 minutes now tomatoes going at the end and that brings a certain amount of freshness to the chutney really helps to give that nice texture [Music] mix that in and literally cook it out for 30 seconds [Music] what's great about this chutney is that as it matures its flavor gets better and better and it will keep for up to six months fill up the jar and that is going to deliver amazing flavor across christmas [Music] and look my goodness me that is fit for a king [Music] [Music] my new version of beef wellington retains the luxuriousness which made it brilliant in the first place but gives it a seasonal lift if you want to really spoil your friends this christmas this is the perfect special occasion dish beef wellington has to be the ultimate indulgence one of my all-time favorite main courses and it would definitely be on my last supper menu my version is a lot lighter and sexier and for christmas i'm gonna give it an added twist first off the fillet of beef now look at it it's beautiful first the most important part is to sear it salt pepper the fillet is the leanest and the most expensive cut of beef it comes from underneath the lower backbone a part of the animal which has very little muscle and this is what makes it such a tender cut very very hot pan olive oil and literally roll it around the pan we're not cooking the beef we're just searing it which will really help to give another layer of flavor and beef in lovely now use the side of the pan so the beef sears down the back when you tilt it it's a secret to get it done quickly it gives that really nice roasted flavour delicious once you've got the colour very carefully lift up the beef and see it on top and sear it on the bottom out and onto the plate english mustard what this does now it gives it a bit of sort of bit of heat just lightly brush the mustard over the beef so really important that you do this as the beef comes straight out of the pan as the beef starts to cool down it absorbs all that heat from the mustard horseradish is a really nice alternative as well just leave that to sit and relax as the fillet rests prepare the filling which is called a duck sale put 700 grams of chestnut mushrooms into a blender add a chopped clove of garlic season with salt and pepper and blitz [Music] christmas wouldn't be christmas without chestnuts i just crumble them in to the mushrooms the chestnut's sweet nutty flavour works brilliantly with the earthy taste of the mushrooms and because they contain more starch and less oil than other nuts they have a much softer texture that is perfect for the filling that smells amazing smells like christmas once the mixture is finely chopped cook in a hot dry pan this removes the water from the mushrooms and intensifies the flavour [Music] you can see the water coming out instantly such an essential stage really critical to the success of the wellington that you dry those mushrooms out and get rid of all that water take the mushrooms up even further some fresh thyme in there which will make it really nice and light and fragrant when all the water's been fried off remove from the pan and leave to cool then start assembling the wellington stage one wrapping the beef fillet first of all these wonderful slices of parma ham and look beautiful overlap it and set it there so the secret of overlapping the palmer ham is to make sure it contains all those juices coming out of the beef in the traditional recipe for beef wellington a thick chive and spring onion pancake is used instead of ham but the parmesan makes the dish much lighter and its sweet salty flavor really complements the mushroom and chestnut filling a little touch of pepper no salt because the ham is naturally salty just a little twist of pepper and then from there your mushrooms and basically mushrooms go on use the back of the spoon to spread them nice and thinly half an inch from the ends rump holes no pop it every time there's meat now he comes next lay the beef on top and very carefully fold that over now we're going to lift that up and wrap the beef nice and carefully so all that mushroom and parmesan is encasing the beef all the way over push it nice and tight roll it nice and tight and go all the way over now the secret from here is to really let the clint film do the work just nip it at the ends and squeeze and what we're doing is just creating this wonderful sort of cylinder shape off and then just twist it nice and tightly and the tighter is the more perfect the shape then place in the fridge for 15 minutes to firm up [Music] once it's set it's ready for the final wrap a little bit of tim film puff pastry beef now very carefully first roll the puff pastry over the beef until the two edges meet then trim off any excess pastry and twist the ends together to ensure the beef is completely sealed in its pastry case to set that perfectly and get it really nice and firm to make it really cylinder tight clip them over [Music] and just pull that nice and tight but the big secret behind this is that it can be done the night before and the tighter the clint film the better the shape the more even the shape the more even it cooks put it back in the fridge for five minutes to fill up again then take off the climb film always like the perfect christmas cracker to give the pastry a lovely rich golden brown color when it bakes brush it with egg yolk and then finally you don't have to do this but it's a chefy thing a little bit decoration back of the knife down and then just twist and mark the pastry when it comes out the oven it's got that wow factor [Music] add a generous sprinkle of salt to ensure the pastry becomes lovely and crisp then bake in an oven at 200 degrees for around 35 minutes depending on how rare you like your beef once out of the oven it's crucial you let the wellington rest for at least 10 minutes this allows the meat to relax and reabsorb its delicious juices making sure it's tender and succulent nice and gently hear that pastry how crisp that is this is the bit we've been waiting for oh wow my god i'm in heaven and for me if you want a really nice change to roast turkey this has to be the ultimate for the table it smells christmassy the chestnuts the mushrooms and that nice crisp pastry on the outside look at it i'm ready to die and go to heaven [Applause] for a really special occasion i love to serve my beef wellington with gloriously creamy mashed potatoes and shavings of exquisite white truffle [Music] my first job on christmas day morning is to tackle the turkey and my favorite way to cook it is roasted with lemon parsley and garlic it's fantastically aromatic really easy to do keeps the meat succulent and tastes absolutely delicious for me without question the start of the christmas dinner is this a delicious turkey now once this is in the oven you're halfway there the secret success behind a great christmas dinner is making sure this doesn't turn out dry and it's all in the preparation now we're gonna make an amazing butter and this is sort of the start of the the most important part keeping that bird incredibly moist soft butter a touch of salt and pepper a little touch of olive oil in there that stops the butter from burning next add the zest of two lemons and their juice this gives the flavored butter a wonderful citrus zing three cloves of garlic turkey's a very delicate dainty meat and that's why i want the garlic pureed so it sort of disintegrates and flavors a turkey gently without becoming too overpowering then add a generous handful of chopped parsley wow that smells incredibly light give that a good mix turkey's a very very very lean bird and it dries out so it's so important to make sure that we help it to cook perfectly butter done now prepare the turkey we'll season the bird inside the cavity salt and pepper next half two onions and pop them in as they roast they steam inside the bird giving a lovely sweetness put in the lemon and a couple of bay leaves for their bitter sweet spicy flavor we're sort of lining the inside of the turkey with these fantastic sort of flavours you can see the bird is upright and it's looking sort of like it's standing to attention now it's time to add the flavoured butter just very very carefully open up the skin go through over the back of the breast and keep the skin intact the idea is to gently loosen the skin with your fingers so the butter can be stuck underneath it now once you've loosened all the skin off the top of the thighs turn the bird around and just go through here again hand up and just release a little bit but don't completely break it because i don't want all that butter to run out right from there now take your butter put it into a ball that smells amazing lemony citrusy and just sort of flatten it and stick that in there underneath one side now once you've got it in there pull back the skin and just use that to sort of slide all the way down what we want to do now is line the top of the breast with all that butter there that butter is going to keep the turkey breast really seriously moist turn the bird round and finish covering the breast with the butter turkeys originally came from north america and they're best young and plump my favorite breed for christmas is either north of black or norfolk bronze both of which have a wonderful gamey taste take the rest of the butter and carefully massage over the breast legs and wings you can do all this the night before and simply cover the turkey with tinfoil and keep it in the fridge ready to be cooked on christmas day into the tray a little touch of olive oil now olive oil on top again that protects it gets that skin really nice and crispy and it stops the butter from burning now in the oven at 220 for 10 minutes to get really nice and brown quickly in she goes beautiful [Music] that smells fantastic after 10 minutes take the turkey out of the oven and baste then cover the breasts with smoked streaky bacon what i want to do is add a little bit more flavor i'm already starting to think about my gravy so the bacon protects it stops it from drying out but it's going to start to really give my gravy a wonderful base turn down the oven to 180 degrees this five kilogram bird will feed eight people comfortably it needs roasting for two and a half hours or half an hour per kilo basting every so often [Music] back in and now she's on the way look at that beautiful it's as pretty as the christmas tree that smells fantastic wow look at that beautiful that is 90 of your work done there to test the turkey is cooked stick a knife into the bottom of the thigh and if the juices run clear it's done the secret now is to let the turkey rest uncovered for two and a half hours as the meat relaxes it reabsorbs its juices making it succulent and tender plus it'll be easier to carve it might seem like a long time to let it rest but remember the turkey doesn't need to be piping hot because i'm serving it with hot gravy that looks like a million dollars let that rest because the flavor will be ten times more exciting once it's rested the key to pulling all the different elements of your christmas dinner together on the plate is the gravy my recipe for turkey gravy made with cider and walnuts has a wonderful aptly nutty flavor which beautifully complements the turkey meat and fruity pork stuffing as that turkey's resting i want to make the most amazing gravy when i say amazing i really do mean amazing drain the excess fat from the roasting tray and put it back on the heat then remove the bacon from the top of the turkey and the roasted onions from the cavity look at them my god they smell amazing finally take out the roasted lemon first of all cut up the bacon lovely bacon into the tray hear how crispy that is that's the start of our gravy the onion look at it beautiful doesn't get any better than that chop that up onion and bacon in that smells incredible when i first got the chance to cook christmas lunch for the chefs in paris they taught me one crucial thing i was only 21 at the time and they made me rest the turkey for as long as i cooked it so i cooked it for three hours and i rested it for three hours what a difference incredible next chop up the roasted lemon and add to the tray put in a couple of sprigs of rosemary to give it a lovely aromatic punch and fry then add three chopped tomatoes which helps to thicken the gravy and give it a lovely fresh taste [Music] now it's time to really get the turkey flavor into the gravy snap off the wing take off all your little trimmings put these little bits here add that into your crayfish these are the bits we never use everyone throws them away off there that little baby there take him off i want that bang flavor delicious try that off it smells incredible next pour in the dry cider this adds a lovely subtle apple flavor that really lifts the taste of the turkey meat as the cider starts to reduce pour in the delicious resting juices from the roasted turkey wow there you go the most amazing flavor [Music] when the liquid has reduced by half crush the vegetables and the turkey pieces with a masher to extract the maximum amount of flavor and basically what's happening now is that we're giving the gravy a little bit of body pour in the chicken stock and reduce again in now a little taste wow i mean you just close your eyes wow it oozes flavor and turkey

know i love eggs and so i'm gonna do a little bit of scrambled uh here in portugal but with a twist because it's not a scrambled egg it's gonna be an amazing omelette made with teresa asparagus a little bit of pepper shallots but i'm not talking about any kind of trees though i'm talking about the porco preto this is the black pig chorizo uh incredible the flavor is unique we're gonna keep it a little bit more sort of portuguese as opposed to the spanish omelet but uh it's gonna taste delicious first things first i'm gonna take this chorizo look at the fat in there the color honestly so beautiful now you can either grate this or just dice it up i'm going to dice it up into little cubes not too small otherwise it'll sort of disintegrate now i want the oils separating from there but i want the flavor okay and you wait to see the way this literally colors the eggs and colors the asparagus is so beautiful get a little bit of onion in there some shallots nothing fancy here okay it's a rustic portuguese style omelette slice them all together and from there get the asparagus tips these are young asparagus okay all i'm gonna do is cut them into about an inch long little spares and literally now look at the color starting to build up and it's all raw still a little bit of the padron peppers local peppers give a touch of heat in there as well seeds kept in nothing wrong with that a little bit of local mushrooms as well into a bowl that goes okay a bit of salt a little bit of pepper and just a little teaspoon of olive oil okay to get that going and a little touch of butter that'll really help caramelize and brown the ingredients now over to the pan mix that up pan is super hot really important now to get the ingredients ready first before we start cooking those eggs ingredients in beautiful now the chorizo is working its magic it's starting to sort of break down the smells are amazing the butter it's gonna give those vegetables a really nice sort of nut brown flavor getting all the water out the vegetables that way the texture on the omelet is delicious and look flatten everything out if we flatten everything out in the pan it cooks so much quicker now you can see the color of those vegetables it's been stained with that amazing rich garlicky oil coming out of the chorizo beautiful now let's not get them too dark okay just color them enough in a way that we're going to add them back in to the omelette and so that's really important to sort of keep it nice and light back off okay that goes in look at that flavor in there oh my god now in there i'm gonna add some parsley get it all done now so inside that omelette that flavor is locked in there okay and the stick behind any great omelettes to make sure it's just a little bit runny in the middle eggs continue cooking as you know now look parsley in okay and that's the filling for my omelette now look at that that's beautiful clean out the pan a little touch of olive oil in just a splash a little touch of butter and now we're going to start the omelet okay that goes on the stove not too hot on and then we start the eggs very carefully crack the eggs in i like four or five eggs for the omelet because this is the kind of omelet that you can literally cut in half they can serve for two or even three guests no seasoning omelette yet really important five eggs in a light whisk just a light whisk and all i'm gonna do is put some pepper in there open up the top of the pepper mill so it opens up and gets really nice and peppery in like whisk no salt really important okay from there a little touch of butter in there okay and then literally a little drizzle of olive oil now this is where it's going to be super quick okay because this thing moves very fast eggs salt and ingredients let's go take your pan getting nice and hot eggs in this is where you start to work that omelette okay work it round you can see it's just starting to fry take it off the heat a little bit once it starts cooking all the way through you can see okay now you start to make it nice and flat really important don't do that too early okay and then from there super hot get your mixture okay and start filling in the center i always say the center so we can fold it nicely okay hold it like a little pillow the smells are incredible okay and then look from there put that back on the heat for 30 seconds you season the inside of that now you can't seize an omelette after it's folded season inside back off this is where the magic happens right here follow me right tilt the pan up over over i've kept it nice and thick so it's a lot more difficult okay once you get to that stage tilt the pan up let the pan do the work get your plate and fold now one more little thing watch just and there you

Pre-order...",2022-11-24 22:16:02.926159, it's far harder working in the kitchen with a blunt knife than it is with a sharp knife the secret behind keeping a sharp knife sharpen it before and every time you use it first grip the steel feel really comfortable about holding the still imagine you're holding a tennis racquet or you're playing squash you've got to be really comfortable with it now 45 degrees confident grip confident grip with a knife this is the butt of the steel really important to keep your fingers behind there you never grip a steel with your fingers over that because the knife comes back in you've just lost a finger always grip behind nice long strokes so we get the whole of the blade over still stroke and we start from the bottom to the top so there across there across slow strokes over the top of the steel and then come back underneath then back underneath it is so dangerous working in the kitchen with a blunt knife you can cause so much damage working with a sharp knife is 10 times quicker more efficient now that's ready to start chopping to stop your chopping board rocking or slipping a great tip is to simply wet a kitchen cloth kitchen paper or tea towel and place it underneath [Music] now you can chop with confidence [Music] my next top tip is get the most out of your humble veg peeler it's brilliant for slicing ultra-thin ribbons of veg perfect for asian dishes great for making long delicate parmesan shavings to top soups and salads it also makes wonderful chocolate curls your pepper mill is more versatile than you might think tighten the top screw to get finely ground pepper ideal for soups and sauces [Music] for general seasoning you want it medium ground so set the screw in the middle and loosen it right off for coarse pepper perfect for steaks and fish [Music] peeling garlic for one clove simply bash it with the back of a knife and the skin comes off easily for a whole head crush separate into a bowl cover and shake hard for about 10 seconds then simply pick out the peeled cloves basically three knives a heavy duty chopping knife followed by a small paring knife which is brilliant for prepping vegetables and then this baby here a serrated edge knife for carving and slicing basically that is it before you buy a knife hold it in your hand and make sure it feels right for you the secret behind a great set of knives is in the handle if you're comfortable holding the handle your cutting can be so much easier the firmer the grip the better the chopping the heavier the handle the more control you've got over the blade with these three knives you can't go wrong this is the root that's absolutely crucial leave that on there if you cut that off the onion will start to bleed and you'll start crying rapidly slice going forward let the weight of the knife do the work three fingers one in front two behind and this part of the knuckle is going to guide the knife fingers on top of the onion point the knife towards the root and try to get as close to the root as possible nice long stroke and then push the onion back together push the knife halfway in to the onion slightly tilt the knife down one at the top and then gripping the onion like a tennis ball holding it together in place with the weight of the blade to cut through that onion to get to the base of the root again turn it round up and down motion and that's what we're left there no waste just the root and look there you've got a really nice finely chopped onion so much great cooking depends on starting with a high enough heat if a recipe calls for a hot pan put on early so it gets smoking hot and always remember to preheat your oven at least 20 minutes before cooking a clean cook is an efficient cook my tip for a tidy cooking area is to always have a waste bowl next to you it saves you going back and forth to the bin saucepans i mean basically you don't need a collection of ten all you need really is two a medium-sized one followed by a large one a small pan is great for sauces heating liquids or rice whereas your large pan gives you space perfect for pastas stews or when you're cooking in bulk which keeps costs down made from copper to stainless steel find what's right for you and always get a lid which helps heat the pan up as quickly as possible and the secret behind a great saucepan is the heavier the bottom the more heat it will conduct the thinner the bottom the more chance you've got actually burning your food buy the best saucepans you can afford take good care of them and they'll last you years saving you money in the long run casserole dish absolutely essential when it comes to good home cooking why so versatile the beauty of this thing is the fact that you can actually use it on the hob or start it on the hob and finish it in the oven more importantly cast iron it conducts the heat so you can have the gas on absolute minimal or the oven down to its absolute lowest setting and the thing will just cook naturally casserole dishes are surprisingly versatile and a great investment you only need one and if you look after it it'll last you a lifetime brilliant for one pot wonders roasting and baking tray these things so versatile great for baking whole fish on fantastic for making breads and so cheap a classic two-handled roasting tray brilliant for roasting whole birds finishing sauces gravies on top of the stove over the gastering burner again versatile the more solid your trays are the better then they won't buckle and they will last cheap but seriously essential hull hams are always impressive to carve one easily hold the hand by the bone and cut down the meat as close to the bone as possible you can then lay your cut hand flat on the board making it nice and easy to slice thinly and evenly for perfect pork crackling pour over hot oil before roasting in the oven it'll come out beautifully crisp and crunchy and when you need to chill wine fast simply add a large handful of salt to your ice bucket the salt reduces the freezing point of the water which will chill your wine in six minutes flat flavor chopping herbs the secret is to chop them not bruise them now basil this is a soft herb so treat it with some respect when people go mad chopping herbs all the goodness comes out on the board i want the goodness left inside the basil place them all inside one another with the largest leaf at the bottom and it's almost like rolling a cigar large one at the bottom small ones in the center and then look place them down together and just roll them nice and gently don't bruise them step one rolled ready to slice sharp knife imperative fingers tucked in the bottom part of your knuckle is the guide between you and the herbs that there stops you from cutting your finger really important to get comfortable with a knife and just practice rolling the knife across the board and relaxing that wrist it's all in the wrist action so herbs up fingernails tucked underneath and just up and down up and down and there you have a chopped basil that's not bruised and smelling very fragra right coriander so you get the bunch of coriander hold it down and just lightly shave the leaves off the stalks bunch them up together and then just again let the knife do the work take the fingernails in and just chop once and once only don't hack it just chop it you can always identify when you bruise the herb when you've removed the herbs off the board there's a big green patch mmm full of flavour and none of the goodness is left on the chopping board a great tip for using leftover herbs simply chop finely mix into butter roll up in clim film and freeze then when you want a herbie hit cut into slices and melt over steaks chicken or veg asparagus is great for a simple supper to prepare always remove the lower woody stem by gently bending and the asparagus will snap at the perfect point then boil or steam and serve with a little of my herb butter when slow roasting meat line the bottom of the roasting tray with chunky vegetables like onions fennel and carrots they act as a trivet to keep the meat from boiling in its own juices plus the veg can be the base for your gravy later on after slow cooking baked on residue can be tough to remove but if you boil water in the pan it will dissolve and break down then simply pour out and wash with soap and water for perfect boiled potatoes always start them off in cold water and never boiling water this way by the time the centers of the potatoes are cooked the outside won't be falling apart chicken stock the vital ingredient to good cooking it transforms sauces it's a fantastic base for soups and more importantly it's so easy to do a little bit of love and care at the beginning and it cooks itself right step one chicken carcass into a pie-sided pan an onion doesn't need to be finely chopped the vegetables flavor the stock onion in then from there cut your leek into nice big solid chunks roughly same size as the onion so the vegetables cook at the same time and then our carrot celery in garlic and then a nice sprig of thyme that helps to really give depth of flavor to the chicken stock a couple of bay leaves and some fresh parsley and then peppercorns pan and just lightly crush them and a little pinch of salt and now just cover the vegetables and the carcass with cold water just cover the chicken and the vegetables bring it up to the ball as quick as you can now as it comes into the boil a really nice skin take the base of the ladle and swirl that around that pushes all the grease and the impurities to the side of the pan then get your ladle and just tilt it if you don't skim all that off the stock becomes very cloudy people's impression of cooking stock then it needs to cook for three four hours at a time this is one chicken carcass let that boil away gently for 30 to 40 minutes maximum now we're gonna pass it off take a sieve place that over the pan and then just pour that in it smells amazing it's aromatic the color is absolutely beautiful and there you have the most amazing stock

Well this week on Ramsay in 10 Gordon is cooking up a Rhubarb Tart that, well, breaks the 10 minute rule....slightly. Using...",2022-11-24 22:16:02.926159, [Music] now come on we've all got a sweet tooth so i take you looking for a perfect dessert that's beautiful delicious and so quick well let me tell you my rhubarb tart is gonna really up the ante on your typical dessert especially at home but i do have a confession to make it may take a little longer than 10 minutes oscar pan down please puff pastry this is store-bought puff pastry don't be worried about it it's really good and so simple we have a little puff basically short crust is equally as good beautiful marzipan and that's the sort of fast-track substitute to make in a frangipane lovely false rhubarb delicious from yorkshire blood orange a little bit of honey mascarpone cream cheese almonds a little bit of butter and egg and that should make the perfect heart right let's have 10 minutes maybe plus one or two on the clock please right first off take the back your knife and just go down about a centimeter in and what this does is sort of literally starts to lift up the outside of these little rolled parcels of puff pastry now like i said this was store-bought and all we're doing here is creating this little line okay and that will give you a sort of edge it'll give you a lift and so when it cooks in the oven it sort of creates this little moat that keeps the juices in and more importantly okay it helps to create an edge on your tart okay now i can go fancy and go along and sort of lift that up but that there is fine now the rhubarb okay look at the size of that gap there and slice there through okay and literally one stick per tart should be sufficient and the beauty of these is that they are so sort of cheap cheerful you see rhubarb everywhere especially across the summer and boy is it in abundance i don't like peeling it because all that flavor is in the skin growing up with rhubarb it was literally rhubarb crumble rhubarb pie you name it we had it now line these up from there take your brush and just lightly egg wash the outside of that puff pastry that's gonna give it okay a really nice glaze okay and you'll see the difference especially when they cook in ten minutes okay it's quite thin the pastry it's already rolled out that's how practical and easy these tarts are they're very easy for a sunday brunch sort of pick me up dessert straight after pretty impressive when they come out now from there glaze egg yolk only that gives that sort of royal texture to the puff pastry now with a master pan take your box grater get the small side of the grater and just go straight down be careful it does stick i've frozen my marzipan and so it's like a solid block and that helps to sort of create a lot easier shards okay and you'll see as i start to grate it it sort of crumbles quickly which is nice there that's what we want and all we do now is just get that very quickly and sort of line the top of that okay from there spread that out it almost looks like sort of grated cheese but what it does it gives a really nice sort of grate and it sort of coats the tart usually break it up so it doesn't clump together again one more and move it around so it separates nice now look sprinkle that gun down and lightly put it on there so let's take two i don't mind going over 10 minutes especially for a dessert and let's be honest it's very hard to get a seriously good dessert done in 10 minutes but this is gonna be close let me tell you from there marzipan favorite little bit of sugar sprinkle sugar over there you can see we're starting to layer up that puff pastry like i said short crust is just as good but puff pastry gives it a bit of lightness now for the rhubarb right start layering these in now okay and just run down the side and make sure it sits within that box okay beautiful when they get a little bit thick just open them up and do the big ones in half down now the secret behind the marzipan is to make sure we've got that wonderful sweetness against the tartness of the rhubarb and just sit that on there a little bit of sugar on top and then into the oven and watch the glaze take off the sugar goes on top and that gives that nice sort of sweet sugary effect especially the tartness for the rhubarb in we go and literally they're gonna take about eight or nine minutes right they're in how do we feel that time let's get those almonds and let's make the delays pan on for the almonds okay i want to toast these almonds they're so tasty when you toast them but i want to make them a little bit more sort of extra special dry pan okay flatten them out and literally just lightly season them so it's sort of almost like a sort of toasted salty almond that sits on top in this pan we're going to make a a beautiful glaze the secret here is start off with a bit of honey okay and then we use that blood orange and this will really help for a nice glaze to go on the top of that rhubarb so bring that honey to the boil okay squeeze squeeze squeeze beautiful honey and blood orange glaze that goes on top of the rhubarb sits brilliantly okay from there i'm going to get my zest on my blood orange that goes in and then we're going to sort of almost flavor that with the actual blood orange little segments here i've got my mascarpone cream cheese which gives that nice sort of added silky finish to that rhubarb tart okay in in in now and turn that round take all those bits out there look at that beautiful flavor nice almonds get nice and toasted and with the salt on there they sort of they sort of smell almost like a sort of salted almond really nice flavor from there top and tail find the base find the top to very carefully go around and literally take off that pip now tarts from the oven the color of these blood oranges are useful almonds look at that now beautiful beautiful onto a plate hello please seven minutes gone old ones come out and then look from here continue going all the way around and look i'm gonna do this now over that turn that upside down now it's unfair to be penalized for the time in the oven but the actual prep time trust me is less than 10 minutes take these little segments off go in is these little sort of guided segments goes in i want half the juice in there okay and half the juice in the mascarpone cream cheese look at the color of that so beautiful now wash your hands check my tarts she's starting to rise she's starting to rise from there give that a little beat then look a little bit of juice we've got that really nice zest it's a lovely way of finishing a dessert it's so good we'll put a little bit more of my zest in there that helps to color the cream okay and so we've got the nice tightness of the mascarpone and then we've got the beautiful vibrant glaze blood orange glaze that sits on top of that rhubarb it gives that nice sort of sweetness to the tartness of that rhubarb shake all that in there beautiful nice mix mix mix and that's ready i'm going to cornell that on the side of the plate using a really nice hot spoon so we can lift this thing up right time for a cup of tea while i wait for my tarts this is the worst bit about being a chef waiting yes right now take a look at these babies come on 60 seconds little glaze a little glaze little glaze little glaze here we go so take that glaze over use the back of the spoon and glaze boy they smell delicious honestly even cold they're delicious little segments in there [Music] and then how do we lift that how do we literally just yes yes yes stop rushing me and then from there look lift that up let's use this one here first yes a beautiful amazing rhubarb tart done in 12 minutes to all of you thank you for watching ramsey intent if i went too quick i apologize but slow it down now don't forget to pick up ramsey and 10

more olive oil on there okay and let that literally get going okay now the goddess sauce this is a beauty the ramsay household we use this on fish chicken red meat and of course white meat first of all a nice tablespoon of dijon mustard you can use a english mustard but the dijon mustard helps it become a little bit more sort of almost sweeter less spicy followed by buttermilk now that's the beautiful acidulated yogurt and it gives a really nice flavor to that sauce fresh tarragon just get your tarragon and literally hold up and pull off those wonderful leaves that gives it a really nice sort of acidic slightly spicy flavor i want to get those stalks out so just hold it up and peel off those little leaves fresh tarragon really helps lift the sauce and literally helps with the color as well and then from there literally get your avocado okay in open that up and look at the shape of that that should literally fit the spoons so get your spoon in there i need to peel it and just go up and in okay now a nice tablespoon of cider vinegar okay and now we're going to blitz that on literally 10 seconds take that off give that a good shake and again beautiful tap it and then look most beautiful amazing vibe sauce that goes so well with that chicken now look under here [Music] you see what's happening but here's a little tip get your jug and just literally place a little bit of water there oh what that does it sort of steams the chicken as well it's a really cool technique just make sure you've got the extraction on when you do it right now from there lift that lid off and look that chicken cooks so beautifully look at that back on underneath time please four minutes to go and again a little bit of steam in there it works so beautifully it creates the steam and the chicken has been colored it's got that wonderful caramelization on there now that water in there steams i've kept the gas up nice and high okay now when we come to finish this dish okay that water will evaporate okay i want to quickly just get some nice sliced bread now look i can turn that gas down now and now it's steaming i'm going to use this pan [Music] get that really nice and hot this time okay that chicken is cooking beautifully really really important if ever you're in doubt of the thighs or the drum just take your knife and just go through again you'll see look those juices are clear the breast is nice and plump and it's cooked beautifully the thighs of the drums always take a little bit more but it doesn't matter now turn the gas down we've steamed that drizzle olive oil take your lemon and just squeeze some fresh lemon juice from that think of what's happening now with a smoked paprika squeeze and put the rest on there and we're just going to grill the lemon but squeeze the juice out of it first squeeze and then grill the lemon as well now in this pan i'm gonna make some beautiful croutons okay and the croutons are gonna go well with a salad tablespoon of olive oil in there time please 2 30. right from there it's a really nice sort of crusty leftover bread and you know the best croutons are always made with stale bread it doesn't go off it just gets drier therefore they get more crispier nice big chunky croutons okay get that oil nice and hot and then literally in we go we're gonna sort of toast these now beautiful okay a little bit of salt a little bit of chili okay and get those croutons nicely toasted now here we go is there toasting start dressing your salad okay i've got my fresh gorgonzola and all we do here is just put a little touch of salt a little touch of olive oil and a fresh squeeze of lemon juice okay and that's going to make it a little bit more sort of vibrant up but before we roll it around dressing just break off the gorgonzola okay and just sit that in and look you don't want to make any pretty pictures with this salad it's a sort of rustic delicious salad croutons are nice and crispy that is gonna sit beautifully my place one minute left and then with the avocado out get your spoon in round over she goes and then literally just slice that down and sit that on top of your salad beautiful boom and then look lift that chicken up she sits on there my croutons go on so crispy and then finally 10 seconds and then finally my lemon sits on there as well this could be squeezed on and then finally boom

little touch of red wine really why the red wine well because i'm going to make it nice and rich okay reduce the red wine down yeah and then start covering your with your stock now i'm gonna bring it up to the bowl okay and then get some fresh rosemary okay like little taste yes please does it hot it's a little bit hot be careful as it cooks out the wine and the alcohol will disappear it will be

brings back good memories no just why'd you do that dad i just want to fork it to get it nice and spiky so i want that nice crispy topping and then lightly grate that cheddar cheese on top and that goes in the oven literally 20 minutes 180 minutes jack can you on the door people that looks lovely doesn't it even though you said you didn't like it earlier okay back in the day mama's meals all came with two veg and this is no different but with a modern twist braised peas and carrots with a fantastic homemade mint butter shepherd's pie glazed on top that looks lovely doesn't it and then the carrots that's why i didn't put carrots in let's put them on the side i'll see this is my ultimate childhood dinner shepherd's pie with crispy cheese champ topping sweet buttery peas and carrots now we're gonna make a delicious beetroot risotto we need to get the shallots just slice them in half and then just chop them like that okay okay now have you ever made a risotto no i haven't actually shallots please into the pan for daddy add a sprinkle of salt and pepper along with a couple of crushed cloves of garlic once you start cooking the risotto it's really important to have your stock gently boiling away if we're adding cold stock on top of the rice all the time it just slows down the process generally you cook a nice wide flat pan if you cook in a deep pan all the rice sort of cooks at different temperatures what stock is that in there dad because that's a vegetable stock yeah because you can't have different stocks if it's more vegetarian can you have chicken stock i made that mistake once putting beef stock in the vegetarian soup did you no i didn't matilda are you sure i'm positive i'm joking fry off time how nice does that smell it smells delicious rice in that's a bit of a different rice this is elboria rice it's a perfect rice for risotto now it's really important to sear the rice if we were just to put the stocking without sweating off the rice it goes all starchy so keep on stirring for daddy it's just gonna make a fun day no flambe on the risotto to go with our deep red beetroot theme i'm adding red wine followed by the first ladle of stock to get things started now we're off wow it's giving it a cloudy sort of look what's happening to the stock the stock is reducing down and the rice is sucking it in that's right so the rice is actually getting nice and plump one of risotto is live when it's like this now we can't stop cooking there we have to kill it all the way okay ready for the next ladle i'm ready good girl here we go ladle in so we have to make this for literally 20 25 minutes and we're nursing it all the way beetroots peel them rub them a little bit of salt and sugar yeah and a little bit of aged balsamic vinegar in there roasted them i'm gonna grate my parmesan how's that rice doing the rice is doing good now that is exactly where we want to be now look look at that nice glossy textured rice so beetroot i want you to put two thirds of the beetroot in there for me saving one third for the top good sprinkle the parmesan in there for me please all over nice it's like it's snowing again and then we're just gonna get some nice butter in there the butter gives the risotto a really nice gloss look at that beautiful let that come down let it come down first all right get your spoon in there now for daddy beautifully there you go good wonderful shake it risotto should be like lava it just flows out and then the rest of the beetroot on top and then finish and some extra virgin olive oil on top i'll pick up the bruschetta you take that to the table okay let's go danny this is my ultimate vegetarian dinner an anxious roasted beetroot and thyme risotto

together beautiful chives coriander lettuce chinese lettuce baby cucumbers radishes leftover rice a little bit of chili which will get really nice and crispy and then a nice fragrant thai chili paste now first off let's have 10 minutes on the clock please right let's get the lamb in there like i said traditionally it's done with pork and beef but today's gonna be lamb so salt and pepper okay a touch of chili flake yes the thai paste which is a really nice fragrant paste in and because it's lamb okay it doesn't need a lot of work okay it's mince i like to put a little bit of olive oil in there and then you just literally scrunch that up now the seasoning salt and pepper and then of course lime lamb needs that level of acidity it was pork or lamb it's still needed so lime zest in okay and that makes it a little bit more fragrant but packed with flavor now from there give that a really good mix okay i don't like adding egg egg gives it a sort of strange texture you can't really identify it's lamb i like to go into sort of golf ball sizes okay roll and once you've got the golf ball size two fingers on and just pat round so it's almost like a a sort of fish cake shape almost like a little miniature hockey puck okay beautifully done now too thick and an actual nightmare to literally cook evenly so i like them a sort of centimetre the nice thing about these is they don't need to be perfectly shaped just get your golf ball round two fingers on top pat it and then in between your index finger and your thumb okay and yeah one more two more round on top down round two fingers on top and then lift it up and shape it beautifully okay now clean the hands okay now we've got the shape pan get it nice and hot get your second pan nice and hot as well and get that rice nice and crispy and so this dish sort of comes together uh beautifully because it's almost done with like leftovers okay in squash them down again as they go in get some color on there push them down again in and push them down in and push them down remember the actual lamb is cold on top so he's not gonna burn yourself pan for the rice from there get that rice in and get it nice and flat again okay use the back of the spoon and sort of pat that down okay pat pat pat and that's gonna get it really nice and crispy okay in that rice i'm gonna take a chili and literally just slice it nice and thinly okay nice and thinly seeds in okay fresh chili and sort of caramelize beautiful crispy rice is amazing sit that on there i'll take a little touch of coriander cilantro same thing different country up and then literally in i'm going to come back to that in a minute let that sit there and get nice and crispy now for the nam jim sauce first off we start off with fish sauce one nice tablespoon with about five little dabs one tablespoon in fish sauce gives that really nice sour flavor and after that a nice tablespoon of maple syrup okay three glugs one big spoon a touch of chili in there some beautiful toasted peanuts in there okay now look at the look at the cakes look at the meatballs turn them over for that nice spicy smell gas goes up a touch roll them to the side let that pan do the work tilt the pan and it helps cook down the center of that let's get it nice and crispy this dipping sauce is something you can make up at the beginning of the week and it just sits there i like it on fish i like on chicken and equally as delicious especially with lamb now fresh lime roll that light very heavily done when you roll it like that it helps to break down all that juice so when you come to squeeze it it's absolutely packed with flavor beautiful now now i'm jim done mix that up into the bowl beautifully done really nice beautiful dipping sauce rice give that a nice little toss look at the color of that as you've got that nice and crispy back down and push it back down all i want is the color on there chili's working his magic and look i'm gonna make that a

cucumber gives it the refreshness cools down the heat and it's so tasty especially with the lamb again the radish a nice mild onion flavor so good next there you've got these beautiful large spring onions cut them on the bias right in the side you sort of cool down those lettuce cups with the amazing spring onions look the radishes don't slice them just cut them in half and then into quarters and look they can sit there all day long the stalks are so tasty don't throw them away again in half and then each half into quarter as you can see this lovely little plethora of ingredients so it's all coming together beautifully chives don't over chop them do nice batons so you can taste the chives okay big thick batters of chives stick them in the middle and then from there your cilantro literally just through and what i like to do is just chop it roughly and just sort of put a nice little mound there and now look you can see that plate coming together watch because this land has no fat in there these things cook so beautifully and so quickly all right give that a little turn so crispy beautiful time please and then you start lifting this this plethora of asian flavor almost a

for instance i'd much rather put a lot more effort into the stuffing and enjoy it but eat a lot less of it first add pork mince to the bowl season with salt and pepper and mix take your grater and a bravo an apple just get the grater and grate the apple in there usually stuffing is cooked in the turkey but i'm doing mine separately so i can make in advance and get the flavor and presentation spot on now the nice thing about the apple it goes brilliantly well with the pork it makes it a little bit sweeter it also makes it a lot lighter as well which is really important next add a handful of chopped apricots which gives the stuffing another fruity note and a lovely texture the apple disintegrates but the apricots stay really nice intact nice little bite then chop a handful of pistachio nuts again i'm thinking of the build-up of textures flavor and also color pistachio's in now give that a really good mix grating some lemon zest the zest is packed full of intensely flavored essential oils which gives the stuffing a vibrant citrus zing [Music] and for freshness add a handful of coarsely chopped parsley the balance of flavors is nice and delicate and it sits beautifully with a turkey now sage and pork and apple that's the perfect marriage now i'm going to think about the presentation skills tim full a little drizzle of olive oil and then we get a really nice fragrant sage leaves the sage leaves are used to wrap the stuffing start by overlapping them it's almost like rolling a cigar but we're going to roll it in sage leaves taste is paramount but presentation is really important too so it's worth spending a few extra minutes to get this right because it will make the final dish look amazing now a little season across the top [Music] and then take your sausage meat and we want to do now is put half it onto the plate [Music] that's what you run your finger along the stuffing this is where it takes on a completely different flavor again i need some spice in there i want a little bit of heat in the stuffing so it's exciting to eat merguez murgays are traditional north african sausages made from beef or lamb and all we're going to do now is take the sausage and lay that in the middle they're flavoured with harissa a fiery chilli paste which gives them their heat and distinctive colour it really does give that nice sort of wake-up call inside the stuffing if you can't get hold of murgays other spicy sausages like chorizo would work well too take the rest of the stuffing and we'll sit that on top so in cases that murgays [Music] once you've got it like that lift up the tinfoil very carefully and roll that over let the temple do the work roll it nice and tight there fingers underneath [Music] just pull that back and double check lovely look at it it's not even cooked yet and it looks delicious the ultimate christmas cracker fantastic that sage will cook and really perfume the sausage meat and you cut through to the center you've got a nice spicy sausage lovely in now roll it across twist at the ends and then from there up into the hands and you push it in and twist and turn and all that's doing is just making the perfect cylinder beautiful the stuffing can be made wrapped and stored in the fridge a day or two in advance that's the first part of my ultimate christmas dinner ready on christmas day simply pop it into the oven and cook at 200 degrees for 40 minutes [Music] apple and cranberry sauce first things first we're going to make a really nice caramel sugar in add 150 grams of caster sugar to a pan followed by a couple of star anise that helps to really give a nice sort of aniseed flavor to the cranberries next lightly crushed four cardamom pods this has a lovely warm spicy sweet flavor then wait for the sugar to melt and form a caramel really important to have the confidence now to colour that caramel so it gets really nice and dark before putting the cranberries in [Music] [Applause] [Music] wow the smell of that caramel is amazing now cranberries in [Music] crammies are very tired and acidic but balanced with the sweetness of the caramel and apples they give the sauce a lovely dry sharp note to tell if they're fresh drop them on a hard surface the higher they bounce the fresher they are the secret now is sort of caramel to blister the cranberries and really start to break that down smells fantastic next core peel and thinly slice two apples and once this sauce is finished it really does help to sort of wake up the flavor of the turkey now the cranberries are starting to break down apple in smells fantastic a touch of salt and pepper that's really important really helps to balance that tartness against the acidity of the apple salt pepper really brings it back the smell is fantastic it's a sort of sweet sour spicy nice now from there delays the pan with a touch of port around the side deglazing dissolves all the lovely sticky caramelised bits of food that are stuck to the pan and incorporates them into the sauce next add the zest of an orange and for another layer of fragrant sweetness squeezing the juice lovely then cook on a low heat for five to ten minutes to thicken but remember the sauce will become even thicker once it's cooled down now that is the right texture i don't want a runny sauce i want something really nice and thick delicious packed full of flavor perfect if you really want to get ahead this sauce can be made three or four days in advance and kept in the fridge which allows the flavors to develop even more [Music] another job done leaving you more time to enjoy this very special day [Music] and brussels sprouts are delicious when they cook perfectly packed with texture and the flavor is extraordinary take off the outer leaves trim the bottom and cut in half that's a big step up from the crisscross on the bottom that my mother used to do every christmas i'm cutting them in half so when i soda them they cook evenly and look it's like little baby cabbages it's so compact then blanch them in salted boiling water for two minutes now this is the most amazing pancetta lightly cured pancetta is a type of italian bacon which is brilliant for adding a lovely rich meaty flavor to dishes i want a really nice robust flavor to go with that earthy texture of the sprout it's made from pork belly and is dry cured with salt and aromatics like juniper bay leaves nutmeg dry thyme and garlic as it hits the pan that fat on top of the pancetta melts and gives the sprouts this amazing flavor after removing the skin cut into small chunks if you can't get hold of pancetta smoked streaky bacon is a good alternative now hot pan a teaspoon of olive oil [Music] give it a nice seasoning with salt and pepper as the lavender start to crisp up take your sprouts out drain them [Music] sprouts in now give that a really nice little toss then chop up a handful of chestnuts now the chestnut has sweetened the flavor of the sprout really important that you don't put the chestnuts in too early otherwise they'll go mush and then just sprinkle the chestnuts over lovely so we've managed to turn a sort of plain jane sprout into something quite delicious you've got the texture of the smoked bacon the sauteed sprout and that nice crunch and sweetness of the festive chestnut ten seconds before they come out lemon zest over now that makes the sprouts and the bacon harmonize and then just to squeeze our fresh lemon juice over the sprouts beautiful this right now is the ultimate and for me that's a really nice modern 21st century approach to cooking an old-fashioned vegetable you

Well today on Ramsay in 10 Gordon is putting together a Shakshuka that's gone green! With some of your favorite green vegetables,...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, [Music] now come on it's obvious by now you all know i love an egg for breakfast or brunch especially when it has a kick and it's packed with flavor that's why today i'm going to show you how to make shashuka but trust me not any shatshuka this is a green shiatsuka right please oscar pan down green we know it's the north african beautiful spicy dish but we're going green okay beautiful fresh kale asparagus young courgettes pea tendrils chives fresh peas and then we're gonna put the eggs in there and do a fast bake without even going to the oven right let's have 10 minutes on the clock please now this dish is a beauty but the secret behind this is that we're going green not red everyone's done this literally with those tomatoes and spice we're going to do this thing a little bit differently okay take your courgettes top and tail them and let's just get a little bit of sort of life inside the courgette don't just slice it down slice at an angle you'll see the difference again open it up we start off with a little touch of olive oil okay because let's go in and literally bring that heat up they're going to take the longest to cook okay so obviously they go in first again hold them down and just slice them lengthways okay now why green is much healthier i love the healthy side of this and that nice vibrant green flavor right gas on i've got my griddle pan ready for my bread turn the gas up and let's get some heat in this pan now the secret here is to sort of start building up those layers i got my baby courgettes from there look what i'm gonna do with the shallots i'm going to chop them i'm just going to slice them i want to keep them nice and whole but check out the colors colors are beautiful and this is the kind of dish that you can literally sort of start off and finish in the oven i'm going to do this in 10 minutes as the longer version that can literally take 20 minutes and you start coloring the vegetables and they go into the oven i'm going to show you live how we can do this whole thing here in front of us so shallots courgettes get your kale and just literally slice through there like that okay and all we're doing now is just sauteing the greens i love the smell of that sauteed kale it's so delicious and sometimes we don't eat enough of it in our household cam has become the new sort of the new salad every time i put the layer in there all i'm doing is just seasoning okay a touch of heat little touch of salt a little touch of chili over there and then from there i've got this beautiful infused chili oil i'll put a touch at the bottom now as we start building up those layers and then look oscar pan down please pan down now from there that's looking pretty decent the asparagus again don't slice them up just literally snap them they don't need to be chopped they're fresh asparagus they're young asparagus they cook in like three minutes so just snap them they don't even need peeling why would you peel something that thin peel it you've lost half of it we don't need to right now the base is in there okay i've got some chives again i'm gonna do nice large batters of chives i want the flavor that nice beautiful light onion flavor fresh parsley fresh mint fresh basil you can see why we're going green now give that a little stir beautiful really beautiful all those greens are starting to wilt down the chili's taken on the courgettes are roasting so we're sort of getting rid of that water and now it all starts to break down beautiful really beautiful thank you now in here i've got my double cream next to that i've got my cream cheese okay this is going to give that nice sort of rich thickness to the dish mix that in half cream half cream cheese but give that a nice whisk season it okay a touch of salt a touch of pepper touch a chili in there and that's going to incorporate the spice now before that in with my fresh peas okay pigs are in now that smell is incredible okay look at that beautiful so lovely we've all seen the shatshuka that is done with the tomatoes and the spice and the baked eggs this is a really nice way of lifting it up now look at that now for the intriguing part [Music] touch of that cream in there mix that in now look at it now we're starting to add a completely new layer on there and that is going to reduce down please oscar pan down pan down look at that it's like this beautiful green vegetable stew look at that healthy delicious touch more cream in there with that cream cheese in there this sort of lifts everything turn the gas down a touch and look beautiful mix that in first keep the heat in the pan okay a little taste correct the seasoning touch more salt that's beautiful really good indeed now those vegetables are somewhat half cooked so create three little pockets one two three okay get your eggs flat surface and crack that egg on there nicely second one crack number two now you're probably thinking i'm gonna cook this without going in the oven number three watch i've got my eggs in there and put that nice little layer of cheese okay and then what we're gonna do is turn the gas down okay right down right down get your pad frying pan just turn that around for my convenience and literally sit that on there okay time please right three minutes to

thing that i remember as a kid was and beans so this is like a little rendition except we're using the most amazing pancetta ernie come on disappear go and chase some mice now panel get nice and hot i'm gonna turn these beans into glamorous beans pancetta into the pan lightly season that it's cured so it doesn't need that much seasoning now start frying off that pancetta it's amazing how the individual tastes of baked beans they're somewhat bland so i always like to make them a little bit more spicy so a nice finely chopped chili with the seeds chili in now a little bit of garlic crushed phenomenal [Music] get that bacon really nice and crispy fry off the chili and the garlic and then onions my top tip for dicing finely sliced downwards slice across and then cut down to simply dice bacon onion chilli garlic that flavor all contained in that little pan once you've sweated the onion off a little bit of sugar in there the brown sugar will start to caramelize darken and enrich as well at the same time that looks beautiful now a couple of tablespoons of cider vinegar delays the pan it's got that really nice powerful kick to it now spice that up with one of my favorite seasonings worcester sauce bring that to the boil and add your passata puree tomatoes turn that down simmer the sauce to reduce then add in the classic baked bean harrico beans you can buy haircut beans dried or canned they are packed with protein and have a lovely soft texture turn down the heat and let the beans absorb all that beautiful spicy tomato sauce and just let that simmer now five or six minutes now for my potato cakes they're a fantastic way to use leftover boiled potatoes and are so easy to make i'm making a simple potato dough by adding flour and butter to the mash that gives it that nice sort of cakey texture and it goes from this leftover ball potato to this nice light flowery potato heaven take a nice spoon of potato lightly flour your board we're gonna fry these crisp on the outside and just nice and fluffy in the center now get your pan nice and hot we'll start off with olive oil into the pan now put the butter around the outside because it starts heating up by the time it goes into the center it's almost sort of nut brown gently turn them over love that nice light crisp they look beautiful now take them out potato cake in the middle and a nice beautiful spoon of beans growing up with beans on toast as a treat still to this day after all those years has not changed my love or attitude for beans especially cooked like that [Music] my smoky spicy homemade baked beans with light and creamy potato cakes comfort and satisfaction on a plate [Music] family favorite boiled eggs with a soldier that will make your taste buds stand to attention there's something quite nostalgic about a bald egg it's something that's never lost it's magic when you slice that top off and dunk that soldier into the yolk you can't mess with a deliciously runny yolk but this is what i like to dunk in it an anchovy soldier anchovies interpersonal water no salt naturally yeah anchovies are very salty so just a touch of pepper rich in omega-3s the amazing tinned anchovy is a natural flavor enhancer and i use it to pepper many a savory dish from roast lamb to the humble toasted soldier grind them to a really nice smooth paste the smell of that is almost like being at the seaside now get your soft butter and just put half the butter in first 50 50 is the way 50 percent anchovy pretend butter that way got that real nice salty creaminess mix that up that's absolutely delicious trust me finishing that anchovy butter on a slice of grilled fish i'm in heaven the bread this is a sourdough delicious very crusty take four nice slices now get that pan nice and hot a couple of tablespoons of that anchovy oil into the pan and then get your bread and lightly fry each side the smell the anchovy oil is incredible take that out now bring your water up to the boil the secret of softly boiling an egg is to place them into the water gently on a spoon in and just tilt so they don't hit the bottom nice and light up to the ball count to five turn the gas down is it four and a half minutes is it five minutes for a softball day i've cooked thousands of them and every time it's four and a half minutes whilst that's boiling get your bread and spread that on there that is incredible chopped parsley brings that kind of freshness goes brilliantly well with the anchovies hear that crunch on i'm sorry but i can't resist oh my god right gas off one beauty in two i feel like a five-year-old again this is that moment when you open the vault and that little magic inside is all yours there's a great twist on a great classic wow [Music] perfectly soft boiled eggs with dressed up anchovy butter soldiers who would have thought that egg and soldiers could be that delicious [Music] eggs bait in hash browns the secret of a great hash brown are the potatoes i prefer using really nice waxy potatoes they cook better but more importantly hold themselves together we're not gonna slice the onion all the potatoes but we're actually gonna grate them the potatoes get really nice and crispy i mean seriously crispy now the onion that way you get that nice balance of the onion flavor running through every little shard of potato [Music] season with salt pepper olive oil and km give that a really good mix through and then squeeze all that water out and look at all that juice we squeeze out there really important the more liquid you remove the crispier your hash browns will be nice large pan put that on once the pan is hot pour in a good glug of olive oil [Music] that sound confirms how important it is to have your pan nice and hot so it seals the grated potato onion together so take the spoon and just pat it down what we're trying to do now is get it really nice and compact going around the outside of the pan with little flecks of butter you just slip them down the back gently and that gets the onions caramelised here's a great tip for turning your hash browns over quick and easy take a plate place it on top and just flip it over and then slide it back in very quickly you see the color we've got on there now got that nice crispy texture of the potato i'm going to use the hash brown as a bed for my baked eggs crack in your eggs nice and gently just a little sprinkling of the cayenne to make the eggs a little bit spicy then into a preheated oven for six to eight minutes meanwhile onto my bacon and i'm giving it a classic american twist now one thing i could never get my head around when i first started eating lots of american breakfast was the sweetness from the bacon i've grown up to love that combination of smoky sweet flavors and it's so easy pan on and simply heat olive oil brown sugar salt and pepper and butter bacon in and as it cooks it becomes irresistibly caramelized and golden brown toffee gas and my glazed bacon absolutely ready beautiful now my hash browns and baked eggs are ready wow look at that beautiful just put your spatula underneath there onto your plate and that bacon sets beauty on top of the baked eggs and that hash brown underneath and you can see why the best breakfasts in the world are always in america this is an all-american superhero offer breakfast eggs bait in hash browns with glazed bacon [Music] you

inside that pan before it starts to go up a little okay mushrooms in there touch more chili in there okay and then from there literally add your chopped tomatoes now fold that through get your beautiful basil and literally just snap off the tops slice that up and now we create a little bit of perfume inside that meatball okay look at that beautiful the basil is tiny it's fragrant incredibly powerful but so good especially for this sauce and then the magic berry dust the porcini powder over there i'm so happy with that now off of the gas and this is where we start to build out that amazing sandwich let's take the ends off let's cut straight down the center okay like so open that up now set it on your tray now okay set that on the tray and then literally yeah we start the build

removes the stress from cooking and is a pleasure to make chili beef lettuce wraps cooking should never be a chore the more you cook the more confident you become that way you actually start to enjoy it and that's the key to good cooking have a bit of fun along the way this is minced beef and minced pork the pork needs to sit in there otherwise the beef's gonna dry out it's really important to season the mince before you cook it pan nice and hot a touch of olive oil mince in breaking up like that really helps to sort of separate it so we can fry it off with a lot of color with your spoon just go through and start breaking that up the most important thing to remember is mint is made up of cheap cuts brisket belly short rib so it needs help and frying off the mince for color it's so important if this pan wasn't hot your mince is going to boil it's a horrible gray color on there and there's no flavor on your mince taste a little bit [Music] tastes delicious it's seasoned beautifully see how crispy it's going take it much further than you ever taken mince before nice and crispy smells incredible i'm draining it it's crucial it keeps the mints nice and crispy and you get rid of that excess fat that's lovely now just wipe out the pan then wash it low gas now we're going to add texture to the mince finely chopped chili ginger garlic and spring onions spring onions give this sort of mince a really nice freshness because it just gives that crunch nice and thinly now i'm gonna fry off the chilis the ginger the garlic first sesame seed oil teaspoon only in garlic chili ginger in fry that off nicely the sesame seed oil just lifts up the whole flavour brown sugar that starts to really caramelize the chili the garlic and the ginger mince in now my fish sauce that gives it the saltiness you can see now why it's so important to get that mince really crispy because nothing's going soggy staying really crispy fresh lime that makes the mince fragrant and then lime juice roll it and squeeze that in there [Music] incredible i've got the salty i've got the heat i've got the sweetness now i've got the acidicness as well and then finally my spring onions in right at the last minute so i've got crunch in there as well smells amazing literally cook the mince now with sort of 30 seconds to go off and take it out looks incredible smells so inviting [Music] to go with the chili beef i'm making a simple sweet and spicy dipping sauce so everyone can dress the crispy mince to their own taste dipping sauce a little teaspoon the brown sugar soy sauce gives it a nice sort of dark rich color sesame seed oil a tablespoon and just top that up with a tablespoon of olive oil that stops the sesame seed all becoming too rich a teaspoon of fish sauce and then a touch of chili leave the seeds in again i want the heat in that sauce so impressive an amazing show off center piece lime juice in in the coriander chop it through once give that little mix up just check the seasoning that's lovely nice and rich now the lettuce i'm going to use baby gem because it's really nice and durable and sort of quite strong so you just sort of sit these nice trimmed lettuce leaves around now the exciting part to serve take your lettuce up spoon in your mince and then a little touch of dressing just a little drizzle nice and that's the secret of having good easy relaxed food is that you just help yourself food that looks and tastes a million bucks doesn't have to be complex this dish is as fun to cook as it is to eat [Music] first get prepped chopped garlic ginger and chili keeping the seeds for extra kick slice spring onions chopped spring greens and trim ahead of broccoli then whisk two eggs prep done stir fry on add a good lug of oil to a hot pan garlic ginger chili next the spring greens and broccoli add water to steam [Music] then cook rice this dish is perfect for using leftover rice make a well add the eggs spring onions and a dash of fish sauce [Music] scramble then mix season [Applause] top with lime and spring onions [Music] my fragrant fried rice made simple with advanced prep and ready in five minutes this fantastic fast and simple pasta dish made with everyday ingredients just goes to prove you can eat good food whenever you want really important put the water on first so you can just have it gently simmering away ready for the pasta while the water comes to the boil start the sauce by slicing mushrooms first off fingers one in front two behind up and down then add olive oil to a hot frying pan [Music] i want that nice color on the mushrooms off the heat literally 10 seconds and when you toss something really important you get all the ingredients at the end of the pan push down and pull back that noise that's that's all the water coming out of the mushrooms next finely chop a fat clove of garlic [Music] then prepare your leeks just take your knife and go down through the center turn it over and again into quarters see all that opening up and then just rinse the top of that to get rid of any potential dirt or sand it just breaks up into nice little quarters add all that leek into those mushrooms beautiful and now the secret is to get rid of that water inside the leek as it cooks down all the water's gone you just let that really nice intense flavor garlic's got nice and crispy now we're going to add a touch of chicken stock in there beautiful lasagna sheets i'm just going to drop the sheets in to the water lasagna sheets are an unusual choice for a dish like this but they work brilliantly although any type of pasta you've got in the cupboard will do and just twist that pan that stops any pasta actually sticking to the bottom of the pan chicken start to reduce down by half and it's almost delayed the bottom of the pan basically washed all that wonderful flavor off turn the gas down and add a couple of tablespoons of cream this just enriches the dish bring it back up to the ball and let it simmer for three to four minutes now the secret with the pasta is just taking it out a little early so you've got that nice texture hold up the sheet and just nip it and you can feel your fingers in the center it's ready turn the sauce down and lay these beautiful sheets of lasagna into that sauce i'm just going to turn the gas off now and let the pasta sit in there and absorb that amazing sauce

olive oil as it starts to smoke bread in [Music] but look at the pasta now it's been stained by that amazing sauce to serve i want a nice spoon of my mushrooms leeks and cream then i'll take my pasta

have a number of great recipes up your sleeve to rely on and let's be honest we've all got a tin of sweetcorn somewhere so i'm going to show you how to make the most amazing fritter [Music] first off the mixture take your flour sieve really important to sieve the flour that stops the mixture from having any lumps in there just before you get to the end i want to put half a teaspoon of baking powder the baking powder gives the mixture some lift in and just sieve that through a touch of salt and pepper next an egg about four tablespoons of milk and give that a little whisk now just put a little drizzle of olive oil in there that helps to relax the mixture whisk that in make sure we got rid of all those lumps so that i want a nice smooth almost like a cake mixture okay next take the seeds out of a chili to lower the heat roll the chilli so give it a really good shake [Music] tap them out slice in half into quarter and each quarter in half and chop through it's a really nice quick way of slicing a chili into the mixture spring onion take off that outside layer of the spring onion top and tail slice it in an angle it's a little bit of texture running through the mixture i want that nice crunch in coriander just slice through nice and gently and get that in there next to the sweetcorn now drain it from the tin and just pat it dry so it doesn't make the mixture too wet give that a nice mix you can see now i've got two thirds ingredients and one third of the mixture to bind together that's the secret of good frittata so you're you're biting into excitement and not sort of dough pan on olive oil in and hot get a nice big dessert spoon you know there's one nice portion in space the fritters evenly around the pan in a clockwise direction so you always know which one to turn first just with the back of your spoon sort of spread them out a little bit okay palette knife just check happy with the color and turn over beautiful now for the chili yogurt dressing deseed and finely chop a red chili and add to a pot of natural yogurt [Music] and then some fresh lime [Music] finish with chopped coriander coriander in and give that a nice mix up that chili just lifts it the

sauce right oscar pandama man uh ricotta so it's a recipe with no yeast super fast delicious plain flour eggs vinegar extract sugar and then for the sauce we've got this amazing beautiful dark chocolate beautiful smoked chipotle paste and that gives it that little bit of sort of intriguingness across the doughnut smoked mold and salt and finish a little bit of honey zest of orange over the donuts right let's have 10 minutes on the clock first up get you all on okay now i'm using a peanut oil okay and just bring it up to temperature don't go too crazy and literally two inches on the bottom not half full not two-thirds full and then on standby i've always got some cold oil because if it is getting too hot move it off carefully and just add a touch of cold oil and that will bring the temperature down immediately never start off with the gas at full nice and low bring that up to temp and take your time with that okay now for the mixture and i cut her in this is an exciting recipe because there's no yeast and it's almost like a sort of um spicy delicious rich chocolate donut mix in that ricotta okay lightly beat it okay from there get your eggs always crack them on a flat surface that way you get no shell in there whatsoever we're going to lightly whisk that okay i'm going to put that in the bowl whisk with a fork now first off because the cot is wet and the eggs are wet don't add them together okay flour in first okay that will turn the ricotta really nice and dry now mix that up okay lightly bring it together by carb soda that bicarb gives it the sort of aeration okay and then a nice pinch of cinnamon okay i quite like the flavor cinnamon in there sugar goes in sprinkle that in there and then your vanilla extract you can use a vanilla bean but just

minutes get your pan for the dipping sauce gas on very low okay start off with get your cream in and this is a really nice delicious sauce because it's a really nice way of either coating or glazing your donuts nice tablespoon of honey in okay and then this magic here let's say chipotle smoked paste a teaspoon of that in only okay a little touch of salt mix that in don't bring it to the boil but just mix it in a way that it actually just comes together and melts that's all okay once it starts to melt get your chocolate okay and just break that up now the secret here is not to boil it okay if you boil it you're gonna turn the sauce into sort of a granular mess let it melt and just sort of come on and off the heat once the cream starts to melt it helps melt the chocolate but don't bring the temperature up too much okay otherwise they'll absolutely destroy that chocolate that smokiness is in there and it's so beautiful and look it's just starting to melt come down please oscar it's a bit of heat in the pan and you see that chocolate melting and don't boil it and look you've got this beautiful nice smooth rich incredible dipping sauce so beautiful and that smokiness adds that nice little bit of excitement to those donuts right donuts take a little spoon and just we sort of we say cornell but just drop that in okay put the oil up to temp and literally into the fryer the nice thing about these donuts they do not need to be perfectly shaped i like literally heating my spoon in the oil and that way you get to sort of cut into the shape of that donut gas up now because the temperature's coming down heat the spoon again in and look you just come up the side of the bowl and you sort of almost twirl your spoon get that nice spoonful in in again and it comes off the spoon almost like the old-fashioned cornell hot spoon in and turned now you can make this dough up the day before and it relaxes beautifully they'll puff up a little bit in and back off be careful it's hot oil so just be very very careful often the spoon in and there you go you can see these things puffing up now i've got room for one more don't overfill that in and look the dough comes off that beautiful hot spoon now we're rocking time please four minutes amazing who would have thought we could make a donut literally in 10 minutes now gently roll that around and all we're doing now is coating those beautiful donuts they take about two two and a half minutes as they start to rise whenever you're frying anything the minute it starts to rise it's cooked but i want to get it nice and sort of light okay they come out onto a paper and we're going to literally just turn those over look i want the color on there really important i've got enough heat in the oil now so to turn that gas off there's enough residual heat in there for them to keep frying but look at them so beautiful and it's such a good pick-me-up especially for a sort of you know party kids party or even a little treat for a dessert after a wonderful dinner beautiful time please back on to give that last sort of 60 seconds blast i'm using the spoon and i'm turning these over you can just see a beautiful color on there that dipping sauce smells incredible now very carefully take them out and look that's beautiful just check that's lovely nicely cooked it is out once they're hot okay you need to sprinkle the

22:16:02.926159, [Music] now come on let's be honest there's nothing quite like a delicious chicken sandwich but it's even better when it's a healthy quick delicious sandwich full of crunch so today i'm going to show you how to make the crunchiest chicken slider laced with an incredible korean fermented chilli sauce in just 10 minutes oscar young man pan down pan down pan down so come on we recognize these these are called flakes and that is what's going to give this sandwich an amazing delicious crunch light rich brioche buns cucumber lettuce and some fresh limes chicken breasts beautiful mayonnaise and this beauty here take a look at it now it is the most amazing fermented korean chili paste it's absolutely delicious a little bit of fish sauce brings it a bit of a pickle in there to sit on top to give that nice acidity to the beautiful healthy crunchy delicious sandwich please let's have 10 minutes on the clock now first off to cook the chicken it's a breast so it needs to be well lined and there's no fat in there when we've got a drum or a thigh there's there's fat and there's a lot of sort of texture in there on a breast it needs help okay so these are just beautiful breasts cut in half lightly season them okay salt and pepper and a touch of chili flake on there okay and the breading for this is going to be seasoned flour eggs and then we're going to use that beautiful crunch of those amazing corn flakes now give that a little whisk whisk that up don't season that in there you season the eggs in there it turns them gray okay so get the pan on get that nice and hot and let's start off with first putting the chicken in to the seasoned flour now lightly seasoned as you saw i've got a little bit of chili on there as well okay and then from there we shake off the excess flour and dip them into the eggs okay really important if we don't shake off that excess flour then it sort of it stays and lingers and so when you cut through the chicken you've got this white uncooked flour which is not very nice again literally shake off the excess flour and then from there here we go now for the exciting part let them sit there okay and cover them nicely okay like that now traditionally you'll be using breadcrumbs brioche crumbs but cornflakes it's amazing so you want to sort of get down and just scrunch these up almost to the sort of size of a panko crumb okay now look i'm going in there with my hands and cornflakes as you know we all grew up with them and they sort of were doused in milk but to use them as a breading the crispiness of this is incredible and in america they dredged their chicken two or three times to get that sort of crunch on there but here i'm just gonna dredge it once and look sort of will be broken down to a nice flake season okay a touch of salt a little touch of pepper and just a few little chili flakes in there hide them okay now mix that up from there lift up your chicken again use your fingers from there up shake off excess eggs in and then look just cover that up very quickly next one in and roll it around cover it up next in cover it up highly next in i've got one breast cut into half so i'm going to use a sort of one breast per slider one breast per burger so i've got each breast cut into half and per burger you only want to put half a breath in there okay now the pan is starting to smoke from there i get your vegetable oil i'm going to shallow fry these okay make sure that pan is very dry not deep fry but shallow fry so about a centimeter of all in there let that get up to 10. before you start frying always get your paper ready to bring out from the fryer and keep somewhere nice and close in order to drain off your breasts now from there get your chicken okay push it down inside make sure they're coated beautifully that helps to stop all your mixture from coming off a lot more let's test it first here we go and they're ready lay away from you for safety reasons okay so you don't splash your hands with that hot fat shake off any excess lay away and look so beautiful push those cork flakes on top again to make sure that you've got everything evenly coated shake off your excess and then we go now keep that gas up okay again down shake off any excess and there we go we want to get these nice and golden brown now wash the hands now for the garnish okay now get your towel ready or when we literally take them out and let them drain the garnish we're gonna keep it sort of nice and light and simple okay cute bye mister cucumber top and towel we'll do ribbons of this cucumber okay so hold that nice and flat on the surface and just get rid of the skin i don't mind the skin i just don't want it in my sandwich so i just go down along and look that's the bit there that's what i want these beautiful ribbons okay up up ribbons okay and it's almost like paper deli of cucumber they sit nice in the sandwich and more importantly you know it's got this really nice flavor okay i don't want the seeds in there the seeds turn the sandwich watery now turn these over color with those crisps beautiful lovely turn down the gas got the heat in the pan now and that's going to be literally sort of two two and a half minutes each side now with a cucumber get that into a bowl lightly season them okay a little touch of fish sauce over there okay and now i've got some beautiful chopped peanuts in a little bit of coriander okay lightly chop that it's a really nice beautiful garnish and just let that sit and sort of almost marinate that's going to give a really nice lift to the sandwich inside there we've got a little bit of lettuce yep your garnish is ready so when you start to put these burgers together everything's there and seasoned okay after that your spring onions again cut on a bias nice across the angle and just open them up if everything's ready by the time your chicken is cooked you just have to assemble them so in we go and then finally get your lime and zest over all that and then lift it to the next level by squeezing that line over there time please so two and a half minutes to go fresh lime fish sauce delicious you can see where we're going now for the sauce okay tomatoes speed up speed up mayonnaise and the fermented chili paste in be generous with it from there give that a really good mix up the flavor is incredible it's fermented so it's got that really nice authentic korean flavor everything you want from an amazing beautiful now look how crunchy that is i'm telling you we'll turn the gas off okay two minutes for each side turn that over and they come out now literally but they're so crispy look beautiful that's why the breast is perfect for this particular slider oil goes off to the side now we start the assembly this is the

cauliflower cheese and bacon a touch of oil just a touch okay whack up the gas now from there drop in these little crispy bacon lardons and what we'll do here in this pan is sort of almost make it's like a sort of flourless roux okay a nice cheesy smoky flavor that sits beautifully on the toast and talk about toast and boom touch more check that toast now as that bacon's getting crispy get your paring knife and just go around and these little sort of trees are called florets and so the secret here is literally just to get the florets and cut them in half and the big ones into quarter what we're going to do now is sort of lightly toast these with the bacon okay in now you'll be surprised how quick these cauliflower florets cook but just just take a look in there oscar please pan down my man pan down look at that beautiful really beautiful now a touch of salt and a touch of pepper get some color on that bacon but look give that a little toss so that nice smoky bacon flavor is now permeating across the cauliflower cauliflower sort of toasted like this in that bacon fat with a little bit of butter lightly smoked is delicious butter goes in now that stops it from burning but look what's happening to the cauliflower now we start the magic now we start the sort of the cauliflower and cheese richness a teaspoon of smoked paprika in there okay that's going to give it some richness and a little kick and spice in from there some heat a tablespoon of mustard english mustard okay and then roll that round but look what's happening to that cauliflower we've got the heat in the pan in goes the cream cheese generous in goes the double cream and this is when we start to make that beautiful cheese sauce now bring that up to the boil as it's boiling away get your rich cheddar cheese

bit sort of soggy get your spoon and generously start spooning that on and covering five minutes halfway now do not waste any of this that smoked paprika gives it that really nice flavor slightly spicy but it's a sweet spice it's not a sharp hot spice first one done now it's so nice to see all that coming together and you want it sort of slightly loose but feel those slices of bread this is a great pick-me-up when you sort of can't decide between lunch you can't decide between dinner and you're sort of stuck in the middle this is the perfect dish now those bake bits so good get your parmesan and literally over the top i want to sort of cover that now with your parmesan quite thick i want this nice coat okay of cheese on top and the smell of that is amazing part that up okay anything falls off pile it up don't waste those bits on and on and then look finally before it goes back into the grill some crushed black pepper really important and season that cheese okay a little touch of salt and now she's ready to go back in the oven time please man right under the grill i want that grill sort of bubbling that cheese on top now what do we do to get this thing a little lighter how do we get that thing just a little bit more sort of flavoursome fresh chives that gives a nice light onion flavor that we're just going to sort of sprinkle on top of that cheese on toast now we've all had teasing toast many times grilled cheese but this cauliflower and bacon edition especially that smoked paprika honestly is incredible now with the chives i like to mix a bit of salt and pepper no one ever seasons their chives i do and so it just puts that really nice finish on there and then finally time please two minutes two minutes now look at that that is bubbling it's

studying at university but today trust me i'm going to show you how to elevate that notoriously cheap dish into something delicious and guess what give me a v that's right vegetarian right come in oscar let me show you the ingredients uh egg noodles uh delicious rehydrated liter in like three three and a half minutes beautiful seaweed scallions tofu ginger and cauliflower and these here these are the secret ingredient these are the dried shiitake mushrooms they're gonna go into the water and they're gonna rehydrate now traditionally you can start this with a chicken stock a vegetable stock or just plain water today we're going to start with plain water i'm going to show you how to elevate this ramen right let's have 10 minutes on the clark so we can start off with boiling water first of all season that water okay nicely now in the next pan i've got a rolling water we're gonna put our eggs in there get them on a spoon and drop them into that water okay please time me six minutes justin bring it out to the ball don't ball them ferociously they'll get that sort of black line around the outside ball them gently and i want to ball that but a little bit of sort of yolky bit in the middle mushrooms into the water immediately okay in and this is where it starts to sort of go up a level turn the gas up okay and now we're going to start creating that base first off a tablespoon of mixture paste in okay and give that a really good mix now those mushrooms are doubling in size okay and the exciting thing now is that they're starting to give flavor to that water from there a nice tablespoon of soy okay that's going to give some sort of richness to the broth okay a little bit of acidity a touch of mirin okay that gives it a little bit of lift and a bit of a bite and then one of my favorites tawarashi spice beautiful japanese pepper in now bring that up to the boil lightly season it with the chili flakes get your egg noodles in okay and then from there turn off the gas okay that's right turn off the gas now give that a good mix taste that broth that's delicious touch more salt okay for me and then a little bit of salt and look the seaweed scissors i just cut up some really nice strands of seaweed let's have to be very careful with the salt in the beginning i like nice long sort of almost strips like julienne okay every minute this broth is getting better tastier and deeper if i was going straight vegetarian of course i'll be using a vegetable stock a chicken stock it's delicious that bee stock equally is delicious but now open up those egg noodles okay and

idiot sandwich in your household right oscar pan down please babette steak or anglet as they say on false the chef's cut and it is super delicious really cheap it is the perfect steak for a sandwich beautiful big flat cap mushrooms onions a beautiful coltan battered blue cheese lettuce and a little bit of peppery watercress mustard tabasco lean pearing mustard and a beautiful loaf of bread right let's have 10 minutes on the clock please now first thing you want to slice this big slipper into half okay now i like using the chapata bread i like to sort of douse it in some extra virgin olive oil i like to season it nicely inside but watch salt pepper generously okay a touch of chili flake on there generously and then look get that on the grill okay now get something heavy a plate on there and just push that down that's going to get you a really nice crisp beautiful amazing color on there now the steak usually season it okay really important because sometimes you think there's a lot of salt to the naked eye but it's not because we lose 30 of it the minute it hits the grill get that out of the fridge at least three or four minutes before you're going to cook it it's got very little fat but it is quite fibrous okay so you need to be super careful of not overcooking it the secret of a good steak like that is letting it rest okay let's just check our bread i want a really nice color on there and open that up that's what i want and those chilies are doing their magic push it down okay the bread will bounce back up but get those marks on that bread it will make a huge difference now off goes one okay beautiful off goes the second one now we go on with our steak okay let's get the hottest part on again roll it around that marinade and get it on there so bread's working steak is cooking don't keep on flipping the steak leave it on there okay now let's start thinking about the garnish i love these big flat cap mushrooms i love them take off the stalks mush them on okay they'll break down they'll start cooking literally in seconds a nice season on those mushrooms okay think of the way we're laying this up okay i've got my steak i've got my mushrooms onions this time go about a centimeter thick and start slicing some beautiful onion rings but don't worry about opening them up just get them on there okay and start grill them hold like that they'll break up but again from there a little touch of seasoning okay now i want to talk to you about the sort of the sauce how do we come together with this flavor i've got some mustard tabasco and liam perry it's a wonderful combination turn that steak over look at that color it's exactly what we want beautifully done mushrooms turn them over and then when it comes to the onions a little bit smaller a little bit fiddlier doesn't matter on there and on and you can see those colors now from there take your worcester sauce a couple of tablespoons in there first your tabasco first off painted brush and just start glazing that steak okay as we start to cook the flavor and the smell in here is incredible it's almost like a little varnish okay over the onions as well now all that flavor from the steak is coming out it's running into the mushrooms it's running into the onions and it is absolutely delicious now from there take two nice teaspoons of mayonnaise in two nice teaspoons of mayonnaise one nice teaspoon of dijon mustard generously done a tablespoon of lemon perrin and give that a really nice mix this is our lining for the bread okay little taste a touch of spice a little bit more with the tabasco i like it quite sort of hot so that's incredibly rich for the steak salt pepper and that's gonna be my dipping sauce okay dipping sauce and sauce is gonna be on top of that bread time please halfway now sauce goes in okay look at that beautifully done the secret behind making a great steak sandwich is getting organized and this is how i get organized i dress everything first so first off one spoon all the way down okay start laying this beauty up now from there open up my lettuce snap the lettuce and slice that in half okay snap it and slice it in half and then gonna dust that with my peppery watercress okay and then from there lightly season that in there really important salt and pepper and then look get your dipping sauce and just throw that over okay now think of the layers we've got okay so beautiful let that sit it's all in the build-up and if you can build and cook at the same time even better now look the mushrooms are coming down beautifully the onions are caramelized so once that steak is cooked okay there's a nice surprise to this and think of the combination guinness mistakes like tomato and basil just flood that grill with a touch of guinness and just let that guinness literally absorb through those mushrooms through those onions and through that steak and look what i'm gonna do now is roll that steak over that guinness and that caramelizes beautifully and the flavor of that is just incredible now look the guinness evaporates the alcohol is burnt off but the flavor is incredible off with the gas just leave that sitting there okay now we're gonna start building this up i take my onions off the grill and i dot them over that beautiful salad the secret behind any great steak sandwich is in the build okay look at that my mushrooms come off and they sit on top the smell of that guinness it's beautiful and then there now for the steak time please two minutes now for the steak look at that i'm going to slice this on the bias down not too thin not too thick and look color there once that's sliced lift that up and then sit that on top and get that on there i'm happy for it to sort of bleed and those juices to run through that steak sandwich next one off again on a bias again that guinness is delicious the flavor is unreal sit that on top be generous with that okay you can't stick a whole steak in there slice it and let it go now before we close that over season it lightly touch the salt touch the pepper and then your dipping sauce one more time over she goes beginning smells delicious and then finally turn that round look at that and finally it's beautiful age still and sit that on if you can get that on whilst the steak is nice and hot it helps melt the cheese but sort of hide it okay a little bit sort of mischief with it stick it underneath stick it on the side and just sort of sit it crumble it on top of that hot stake and that's going to lift that to another level and then say goodbye because you stick that on top of there you get your knife you slice that bad boy and trust me you open that up take a bite and you're ready to die and there you go a delicious steak and guinness sandwich to all of you thank you for

assistant who never answers back chef mike right oscar pan down let me show you so the big secret behind any stickers i'm putting are dates we're gonna slice them up mix them a little bit bicarb that's gonna literally cause a bit of reaction it'll start to puree those dates then i'm gonna make the cake mix with beautiful brown sugar butter flour egg and this baby here golden syrup we all grew up with that so delicious then on to the sauce finish with a nice tart creme fresh right let's get 10 minutes on the chef mike right power up to 100 okay for 30 seconds no you're not going to believe me this is actually going to be done in the microwave it's a beautiful fast track sticky toffee pudding here we go dates now come on we all have a date unless you're my assistant justin mandel hasn't had one in four years but these are soft chewy delicious and more importantly i'm hoping after this lockdown that he does have a date and she decides to stay with him but now dates slice them nice and thinly okay once they're sliced nice and thinly just put them into a bowl okay and then from there literally a little teaspoon of bicarb okay now this literally helps to break down the dates okay a little touch of water in there just a touch and that will start almost pureeing the dates chef mike are you ready here we go right on power 100 and let's go for 30 seconds and go now let's start the actual cake mix okay let's get the butter in okay alongside the brown sugar now start to cream that okay best thing to do is get the back of the wooden spoon and just literally lightly beat that and what happens now is that we start to sort of break down the butter and we form this really nice sort of batter how long left eight minutes now from there cream with the back of your spoon okay literally sometimes i put my hand on the bottom of the bowl and the heat from my hands starts to melt the butter nicely and then look mix that up nice once we start to cream that in that butter starts to melt and the sugar starts to disintegrate in with a nice tablespoon of this beautiful syrup now in and over twist that around back up don't spoil any beautiful now from there use that spoon to clean that off okay and then literally start creaming that up now it may sound a little bit bizarre using chef mike but trust me every chef uses them and sometimes they're just great for reheating dishes and as you know a microwave cooked from the inside so you have to be very careful egg flat surface crack lift up and beat that in now now you can start to see this batter sort of forming but use the spatula clean the spoon and clean the sides as you go along and then flip over now once you start using the spatula we're incorporating a bit of air now and that's going to make the mixture a little lighter good time please six minutes great now if it starts to separate kind of a little whisk and just give that a really nice whisk and that will get your batter really nice and smooth okay and here we go chef mike to the redmi now once that's nice and smooth it should look a little granular like that nothing wrong with that from there get your dates okay and look they've broken down a touch okay they've gone literally almost like a nice cure back in there for another 30 seconds here we go and that starts to break those dates down now butter sugar syrup are in okay and then from there give it a really good whisk they're nice and smooth and now look just on now from there dates out you can see what's happened there look at this nice beautiful date puree in goes the days beautiful in goes the flour okay we're gonna sift that in there make sure there's no additional lumps and this is where it goes up a notch okay normally we'd be steaming these and baking them in the oven with paper on top and sort of steaming them for 45-50 minutes it's a really nice fast track way now whisk comes out give that whisk a nice shake and then just a couple of turns the whisk comes out get the spatula in there we get that nice even distribution of that flour through that mix so now it's looking like a really nice delicious batter right bowl make sure it's nice and dry brush generously with your butter okay and then just lightly vertically put those strokes up that will help the sticky toffee pudding coming out and it is just a light smidging of butter from there almost like a sort of half a tablespoon of flour shake that around and then just line that mould and all that does it stops it from sticking once you've gone all the way around back in and then look get your mixture and fill it two thirds full and now this is where the magic starts back on two thirds full just in there now give that a gentle tap that let's mix it all the way around the bottom and now take some kitchen roll okay and just sit that on top i want to go sort of 30 seconds times four into chef mike the paper helps it steam to begin with then halfway through it will take the paper off chef mike work your magic myself work your magic in now set that to 30 seconds 30 second increments right chef mike work your magic right pan on now for the beautiful campbell sauce so that paper helps to steam the top and it should be about two and a half to three minutes in chef mike's oven first in goes your butter okay now i'm gonna make this beautiful caramel sauce melt that butter sugar goes in and now we're going to start a camel 30 more seconds there we go now melt melt your sugar so for the beautiful sauce i've got brown sugar butter in there i've got some double cream and then to finish the top i'm going to put some creme fraiche on top of that pudding bring that to a boil and add a tablespoon of that beautiful golden syrup chef mike is working his magic time please now stir that sugar let's check on chef mike now look where we are take that off and that is getting there okay beautiful now chef mike does tend to be a little bit dirty okay so like all good chefs work nice and tidy look at that it's started already take the paper off back in chef mike it's on overtime today now sauce look at that melt the sugar the butter syrup in and then fold in your cream that's going to make a beautiful amazing caramel sauce melt that syrup chef pike and then add your cream in there now cream goes in that stops the sugar from burning back onto the stove and look at that it's got this beautiful aerated toffee beautiful syrupy sauce and mix that in off i want that really nice beautiful syrupy lovely toffee sauce time please how long one minute come on man come on chef mike monty

that garlic off there now lightly seasoning okay i'm gonna put a little touch of heat in mine just a touch of chili flakes in there okay once you start getting a bit of color on that garlic okay i'm gonna add my kale now the kale's gonna be sort of lightly sauteed and then we're gonna steam it at the end i'll show you why get that in there and literally cover the base of the pan with that kale now from there you'll see this almost sort of wilt down but not as fast as spinach and kale's got that nice sort of rugged texture running through so it's got some sort of it's got some energy to it spinach disappears kale cooked beautifully a little touch of salt on top salt on bottom a little touch of pepper olive oil drizzled on top okay i'm gonna throw in a couple of the almonds just now to get a little bit toasty and make that sort of come together as a flavor pasta turn up the heat i like to cook the pasta quick this is fusilli fresh pasta is going to cook literally in about three minutes okay get a nice gentle rolling boil and roll that pasta in there bring up the temperature super quick put the lid back on i always like just to turn the pan that stops any pasta underneath

zest and that starts to sort of make the kale a little bit more vibrant now look what's happening okay the kale's starting to sweat and break down past the water's giving it that really nice touch of starch a little bit of texture on top of that color of anchovies again optional but you need two or three nice salted anchovies chop them up okay and literally just lift that up and throw them on top of the cow now give that a really nice stir as that kale starts to cook okay smell with that citrus at the end just sort of lifts this i don't want to overcook the cow okay i want some structure in there from there get your beautiful mix collect all your kale sort of one side and fill up that beautiful little blender now you can use a blender or you can actually use a stick mix as well this

out and look what's happened it's broken down and like i said you can put that in a blender or even a stick mix but now we start to correct the actual flavor halfway touch more olive oil in i'm gonna check my pasta and look bring that sauce down to sort of almost a sort of almost like a nice creamy richy density sort of texture that pasta's beautiful out don't over drain the pasta starch inside that fusilli really helps thicken the sauce and now you bring the whole thing to boil okay and this is where it starts to sort of almost come alive beautiful come there i'm going to start mixing that in and now you can see that nice fresh vibrant green flavor it's a perfect dish for us at weekends especially after a run or an hour in the gym a couple of hours on the bike this is something that is

american cousins and used for incredible delicates like pastrami and succulent salt beef the key to beef brisket is to cook it low and slow to make it tender and i've got a delicious barbecue style recipe for dinner [Music] we're creating bbq style beef brisket with crunchy coleslaw and sweet potato wedges which will be right up her street holly now you love barbecues right so you're gonna help me barbecue this delicious piece of brisket brisket look at it beautiful it's a very tough cut of meat so it needs to be cooked slowly so it gets really nice and tender are we barbecuing it outside we're gonna actually put the barbecue flavor on there but we're gonna cook it in the oven okay so mustard powder okay here we have some celery seed next a little bit of salt in there okay what's this here cumin two again nice good now this one cayenne pepper absolutely right right two teaspoons of that in there as well good now what i want you to do fresh pepper on there i'll give that a little mix roll up your little sleeves and then i want you to rub all that spice into the brisket almost like you're massaging it in there good girl come on holes get your hands nice and flat on there good girl now that's nice and coated okay in the spice so gas on roasting tray on what we've got to do now with all those spices is sear them in a couple of tablespoons of olive oil into the tray well done okay good that's getting nice and hot now you get your brisket and all that spice lay that in there nicely okay so now we'll start coloring it as you start to sear in you smell those spices yep all that spice left on the plate we're gonna use yeah i want you to get the onions nice and carefully slice them down not too thin but just like you're chopping them take your time smell those spices now good girl thank you damn holly was homework that bad no the onions oh no don't rub your eyes don't rub your eyes [Music] we've got the colour on the brisket okay yeah take that out literally for 30 seconds okay onions into the tray please nice you see it's starting to smell slightly barbecuey already give that a little stir nice now one nice tablespoon of brown sugar what does the brown sugar do dad so the brown sugar we're gonna start caramelizing the onions right from there my bay leaves in please good girl oh yes please right you want to take over good careful that tray is very very hot a tablespoon of tomato puree roast that off at the bottom of the tray and really rub it in amongst the onions good girl now look at the colors onions right now time for a little drink for the brisket okay one bottle of earring please so you go in you put yours in there i'll put mine here god uh good health to you and your brisket good health bring that to the ball okay now this is where it gets really exciting i want you to lift the brisket up and put it on top of the onions in she goes good girl and then i want you to pour the stock all the way around please i'm using beef stock but it will work with chicken stock or even vegetable stock once the stock has come to the boil cover tightly with foil you just pinch in the ends flatten that down and then you just twist all the way so that's nice and tight that's the hard work done thank you simply pop it in the oven for three and a half hours and as it cooks you can get on with the side dishes first job sweet potato wedges with some serious flavor start by making a spice mix in a dry pan toast coriander seeds until beautifully aromatic then put them in a pestle and mortar add salt and grind [Music] next smoked paprika dried oregano cayenne pepper and mix spice mix done now simply cut your sweet potatoes into wedges toss in olive oil and thoroughly cover with the spice mix onto a baking tray and into a preheated oven for 30 minutes turning halfway irresistible sweet potato wedgies are ready now to finish off my beef see that smell just sort of travels everywhere oh now look at that so we can leave that to rest what does resting mean resting means where you've cooked a joint and you just leave it to relax so it'll make the meat so much more tender okay right coleslaw traditionally you would mix slaw with what mayonnaise that's right mayonnaise this time we're gonna do it a little different so i'd like you to put the yogurt into the bowl for me please all of it i'll start slicing the white cabbage and the red cabbage now from there a nice tablespoon of mustard in there please give that a nice mix up nice little touch of salt and pepper okay now a little cider vinegar so a little splash of cider vinegar in there okay as i shred this okay i'd like you please then to get the red cabbage and just open up into that and mix in at the same time and then you fold that in there as i start shredding see how it's coming together yeah right that's all the red cabbage now the white so you've got that nice vinegary tartness to the slaw and the yogurt keeps it nice and fresh last little bit in one more little thing so put some nice chopped fresh chives in there and that will give it this nice light onion flavor so chives in [Music] how's that now taste it with the chives in there delicious so i would like

before anybody that is so good that tastes delicious see all that wonderful flavor in there last job is to create an incredibly quick and delicious sauce gas on and reduce the spicy juices and onions the beef cooked in then add in cider vinegar and you've got a brilliant tangy barbecue sauce that smells nice doesn't it wow that is brisket and a half now the rest of it can go in the gravy pot

#GordonRamsay #Cooking #Food #Salad

Pre-order...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, a great tasting salad starts with fantastic salad leaves and when it comes to all things green there's little dr steve rothol doesn't know i think i am obsessed with salad i'm obsessed primarily with watercress that that's in my heart because you know i've got a phd in watercress a doctorate in salad we should all take a leaf out of his book then he's not only been studying salad leaves for over 30 years he's been growing them so he really knows he's rocket from his romaine there are literally thousands of varieties of salad things like batavian lettuce red veined spinach wild rocket sorrel we grow virtually everything outdoors and and we follow the seasons so we're not forcing the leaves we don't give them too much fertilizer or irrigation we try to grow them a little bit slower and that's the way to get the best flavor and the best quality of leaf we'll harvest the crop cut it in the morning and it's then on the road going out to customers to be on the shelf the next day this is a great leaf baby leaf spinach and we call it baby leaf yeah quite literally because we cut it when it's still at a baby stage these are baby pea shoots we'll put something like three or four hundred pea seeds into the seed bed and then in as little as 12 14 days they've grown to a sort of a crop like this they've got the flavor of fresh peas a bit of sweetness and they've got a really nice soft velvety leaf texture this is baby watercress which is my favorite salad crop of them all watercress is special because by definition it's grown in pure flowing water fresh watercress has got that fantastic pungent peppery flavour in victorian london it was known as poor man's bread whereby a lot of workers would start the day with a watercress sandwich and if they couldn't afford bread they just ate the watercress straight it is amazing full of flavor i can't eat enough salad obsessed steve's spot on there's hundreds of salad leaves available with different textures tastes and colors here are five my favorite everyday salad leaves and don't forget some of them are delicious cooked too little gem sweet and crisp and an amazingly dense heart these mini cos lettuces are great simply braised in the oven or use the leaves as scoops for a delicious chili beef filling [Music] mustard leaves pungent spicy and full of vitamin c these are a staple in asian dishes and are fantastic stir-fried or steamed lambs leaf full of tangy flavour and with incredible springy stems great for hearty robust salads or simply paired with fish for a healthier simple supper rocket these distinctive peppery leaves are actually classed as a herb and are perfect in soups or with fruits and are full of iron finely chicory or endive these tightly packed red and white leaves have a deliciously bitter taste and are great wrapped in ham or alongside sharp blue cheeses i think when you're shopping for salads you can just shop with your eyes if it looks fresh and healthy tasty it is you want to look for bright colors i like to see leaves with a bit of moisture on them sounds like to be kept cold and moist basically so when you buy a pack of salad put it in the fridge and if you don't use it all in one go roll up the bag to exclude surplus air put it back in the fridge keep it cold there's so much choice variety out there i really do think people should be more adventurous in their choice of salads here both what they choose to try and eat and and what they do with them so get yourself some ingredients use them boldly and your studded leaves can really take center stage green papaya salad this is a great salad to serve at a party it's delicious and robust enough to last the whole evening without wilting first off these are a little dried shrimp you can buy them anywhere they smell almost sort of of the seabed into the pestle mulch for this salad inspired by my travels across thailand i'm starting by making a wonderfully spicy paste a little salt in there in just break them up this paste is like a staple ingredient in thailand that's what we're looking for almost it's like a powder right next just one clove of garlic slice up the garlic and get that into the pest and water bird's eye chili incredibly hot powerful but wow it does give an amazing kick to the paste in to the mix now a couple of tablespoons of brown caster sugar that softens the blow with a chilli and then just to give that nice sour taste a little bit of hot water into this tamarind paste it's really tart but sweet paste one tablespoon in fish sauce now it's got that almost sort of pickly smell slightly salty but the flavor is intense two tablespoons in bring that together and give it a really good mix some lime juice in half another touch of tartness the paste is nice and thick and fragrant but it's got the heat the sourness the tartness incredible green papaya stand it up give it a little peel you can find green papaya and local asian shops and bigger supermarkets and as it doesn't weld like more delicate veg it's perfect for robust salads like this i grate it look that's what i want these thin slithers next a nice rich sweet banana shalom [Music] nice some carrot carrot gives it another texture now little that and mix it [Music] finish that off with thai basil and fresh coriander thai basil is a much more fragrant basil it's stronger and it's slightly thicker as well like papaya and tamarind paste you can get thai basil in good supermarkets and independent asian stores but normal basil works well too next prepare the crunchy topping pan on and toast some peanuts chop the nuts but it gives a really nice crunch in they go roll them around the pan gas off and just stick them out now for the exciting palm i'm gonna dress the salad nice spoon of dressing in to the papaya mix that in and then finally a nice general sprinkling roasted nuts and that is one delicious very fragrant very robust green papaya salad so easy to make and guaranteed not to go limp a perfect party salad and with such incredible colors textures and bold exciting flavors it's sure to grab your guests attention when you're putting together a feast for the family or friends it's great to have some bulletproof salads in your cooking repertoire here are three more of my favorites to set you up first my delicious chopped salad slice cherry tomatoes in half and add to the bowl along with chopped red pepper and finely diced shallots next slice salami into strips and add follow with nutty chickpeas and smooth edam cheese cut into matchsticks building up different tastes textures and flavors as you go next add chicory for a deliciously bitter bite then chop crisp romaine lettuce and add for the dressing finely chop garlic add cherry vinegar and shake our spicy worcestershire sauce cast the sugar and olive oil then simply whisk pour the dressing over the salad and mix so that everything is thoroughly coated finally sprinkle with dried oregano for an aromatic finish a salad so easy if you can chop you can make it with such delicious results it has to be tasted to be believed [Music] my next simple salad that's perfect for a party is green bean salad with mustard dressing [Music] for the dressing wrap a whole bulb of garlic in foil and roast it in a hot oven [Music] next add top and tail green beans to salted boiling water and cook for just a couple of minutes this is called blanching and keeps the beans deliciously crunchy [Music] strain the beans and refresh in cold water this stops the

Using the local berry jam (made by monks) as well as fresh autumn apples Gordon...,2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, [Music] right welcome to the up uh we're on the gorgeous lake superior and i've gone hunting for thimbleberry jam with the most amazing monk and come on who doesn't love monk jam now i'm going to turn this jam into a stunning dessert now these simple berries um they go fast let me tell you it's not the moose nipping them it's the bears if not the bears the deer and it's not the deer then it's the monks because they produce the most amazing jam so i've got these beautiful apples that are grown in the same orchard as the thimble berries and i'm gonna turn it into almost like a sort of eggy bread french bread dessert now start off with three eggs into a bowl okay give that a little whisk just nice and lightly a tablespoon of sugar mix that in make sure it doesn't become grainy okay and then literally a couple of tablespoons of heavy cream now nice thick rich heavy cream from there let that sit now i know we're in the woods on the edge of lake superior a little touch of honey in there a little touch of fresh vanilla but that is just enough to coat the bread okay so you can follow a recipe but you should be cooking with your eyes and just making sure it follows through with your whisk too thick it makes it all cloy and heavy nice and thin it gets the bread nice and crispy let that set for a moment apples look at the color of these apples the skin is so delicious that we're not even gonna peel them they're so tasty okay so just a quick chop chop them too small they disintegrate it's a very sweet apple but incredibly juicy so you get them into the pan and sort of caramelize them the apples are delicious oh my god from there into a pan first of all we start off with our sugar sugar in now just wait a minute you'll start to see that caramelizing about a tablespoon of sugar but watch what happens to that sugar beautiful don't throw the apples in there yet now a minute later you start to see that camel okay don't take it too dark apples in okay i'm gonna beautifully give those apples a nice toss and we've got the sweetness coming out the apples now and that caramel's now getting a little bit darker but a lot more fragrant because the skin and the flavor of those apples is delicious now the butter will give the apples that nice nut brown flavor but look what's happening they start blistering we start forming that caramel now it's breaking down but look at the juice coming out the apples so beautiful and then finally this is a beautiful apple cognac so beautiful in oh my lord as that caramel starts to melt a tablespoon of double cream beautiful now the small parts the apple will turn into a bit of a puree that will thicken the cream the can will start thinking the cream naturally bring that back up to the boil and it'll have a slight crunch left in there especially for the bread now bread get your bread in there don't soak that too long in there just literally in and then off to the side if you soak it in there too long it gets too soggy you'll never get it crispy okay so this way we move quick from there a touch olive all in get that pan nice and hot in a little touch of butter beautiful as that starts to color in we go first slice lay away from you deeply done second slice lay away again beautifully done and the third one drain off any excess and then in don't saturate the bread with the egg mixture otherwise it becomes too soggy so literally in and out now as that's cooking get tiny little speckles of butter and put around the outside of the bread this is the kind of bread that i grew up with as a quick dessert in the uk it's called eggy bread and then in france they call it french toast god knows why because it's not toasted however touch of butter that gives a nice flavor to the bread stops it becoming too sweet okay and then we're ready for flipping when you flip these you're going to turn this bread once otherwise you're going to break it and here we go first one beautiful second one in beautiful and then you can see the what that beautiful butter does gives that bread flavor okay apples are reduced beauty down and once the apples absorb all that cream you've got that really nice sort of candied almost like a toffee apple there and now for the most exciting part okay putting this thing together leave them in the pan this is where that plain jane bread goes up a level okay big thank you to the monks that amazing jam you take one out straight on there at the spoon and you spread that thimbleberry jam on beautiful your apples get them on there hot and how cool is this everything's so local next on she goes again back of the spoon thimbleberry jam and then finally got that beautiful slice generals those apples on she goes and then finally a nice little dollop creme fraiche a teaspoon on my jam and then the monks would be upset if i wasted these apples around she goes and that has to be a delicious amazing thimbleberry monk jam french toast sandwich live from the u.p who doesn't love monk jam now if you enjoyed that recipe please click the link below and if

with delicious roasty tomatoes and creamy goats curd now polenta to the italians is what mashed potatoes to britain's a staple incredibly delicious and really straightforward to do now season the water just a little touch of olive oil stops it from becoming too sticky i love polenta it's a cornmeal made from ground dried maize the more coarse the longer it takes to cook but you can also buy instant polenta which is ready in under 10 minutes and always use this at home and then whisk that out as it cooks out it naturally thickens you see the grains becoming almost into one nice fine pureed polenta to take the polenta to another level flavor-wise season with salt and pepper a good knob of butter and parmesan quite generous with the parmesan because polenta can be quite dull i like it quite rich and creamy delicious now mix that in smell a nice smooth shiny glossy planter you can eat polenta two ways like this it's a glorious fluffy mash or set then griddled which is what i'm doing start by oiling a baking tray pour in your polenta now get that in the fridge and let it set next i'm roasting fine tomatoes to really intensify their flavour olive on the bottom of the tray and drizzle extra virgin olive oil on top nip your tomatoes with your scissors if you didn't burst them before they went in the oven they'd explode salt and pepper garlic just squeeze the juice out the garlic so as the tomatoes blister and roast it's going gonna take on all this lovely garlic to give the tomatoes a wonderful sweet and sour flavor a pinch of sugar and balsamic vinegar this is a wonderful aged balsamic vinegar and then some thyme don't pick the time just try it like you're having a little haircut nice the tomatoes only take 10 minutes to roast now the plant is set it's ready to griddle it should just fall out beautiful polenta is a nice garnish for grilled meats it's great when you're planning a big dinner party the polenta can be done one or two days before a nice season top and bottom a nice sort of coating of olive oil and then onto your grill now this looks very impressive but it's so easy to do get that grill really nice and hot make sure you've got a fish slice and go underneath to turn all that nice sort of marking and char in the blender gives that really nice flavor now tomatoes look you got these beautiful vine tomatoes have been roasted and all that wonderful flavor [Music] now get your little tomatoes and just sit them on top drizzle over any remaining roasting juices the perfect addition is a goat's curd goat's curd gives it that nice sort of salty creamy taste goat's cheese cream cheese or creme fraiche will work just as well drizzle a little touch of that aged barcelona vinegar and then a little basil i can't wait to dive in this dish is fantastic when you're entertaining in the morning set your plenty the night before and you can have this casual brunch on the table within minutes fuss-free cooking that looks like a labor of love roasted tomato soup beautiful vine tomatoes the ripe of the tomatoes the better the soup take the core out get your thumb and place it half a centimetre underneath the tip of your knife place it in and then just twist round that's the only part of the tomato that we're not using red onion and garlic red onion because it's sweeter than a white onion slice your onions and your garlic it's nice and fine traditionally you'd be making it in a pot it's so much better to start it off on top of the stove the searing the tomatoes and the garlic when it goes in the oven you actually roast the tomatoes and they don't stew there's a big difference in flavor be quite generous with the olive oil it makes the soup nice and glossy shiny salt pepper and then a little teaspoon of cayenne just gives it that heat but it's not as fierce as chilli take your tomatoes and just slice them in half and then a little touch of sugar that's going to help intensify the sweetness a little sprinkle of aged bottled vinegar it gives that nice dark rich acidity to the soup into the oven 20 25 minutes 180. to make my soup even more irresistible i'm going to make a punchy sun-dried tomato pesto to drizzle over the top now i'm making this in a pestle and mortar because you feel so much more in control and you're not depending on a blade that's whizzing around at a thousand miles an hour next in a dry pan toast off some pine nuts toast them the absolute max and then in the smell in there is incredible parmesan lightly grate that this is where it starts to become creamy next virgin olive oil doesn't need salt because the is going to season it for you and just take a couple tablespoons of the oil that the sun-dried tomatoes are in really helps to make that stunning pesto i can smell those roasted tomatoes want them out wow next pour in a little vegetable stock or chicken stock so it sits halfway up the tomatoes put your spoon through those tomatoes they break up instantly bring that up to the boil let it simmer for three or four minutes i want to make it a little bit more creamy now cream in give that a little stir you can keep it rustic and you get your masher in and you've got that nice thick rich chunky tomato soup or get yourself a stick blender blitzing it like that you delays the bottom of the pan and you get all those amazing flavors from the bottom that's delicious to make my lunch extra hearty i'm gonna knock up a deliciously gutsy version of cheese on toast to go with my tomato soup boss rabbit an absolute classic i'm gonna make a roux 50 grams of butter three nice tablespoons of flour and that's all there is basically traditionally you would use flour butter and milk but in welsh rabbit the milk is often cheekily substituted for a stiff slug of stout gives it that strong gutsy flavor i want it nice and thick make sure those lumps are out a nice teaspoon of dijon mustard and then season it nice and spicy moisture sauce gives it that delicious intriguing flavor now that smells amazing almost brings tears to your eyes beautiful now boss rabbit wouldn't be a stunning welsh rabbit without rich mature cheese soap and a great montgomery cheddar goes well with a beer and drop that in really important to put this in while the roux is still nice and hot because the cheese melts now for the bread i prefer a good rustic country loaf that will stand up to my hardcore topping i want that nice crisp base to my welsh rabbit so toast it both sides [Music] spread that beautiful cheesy berry spicy mixture just great got a blister and bubble and gratinate god a little splash alien perry and back under the grill for 90 seconds in one delicious creamy roasted tomato soup it's coming back to me all those days i had off school i used to purposely lie about feeling ill just to get a bowl of my mother's tomato soup how bad was that but my god it was worth it oh now oh i'll show you [Music] look at those babies that just takes cheese on toast to another level wow roasted creamy tomato soup with a sun-dried tomato pesto served with the most amazing delicious welsh rabbit i feel like bringing in sick [Music] a delicious saffron flatbread with mussels it doesn't get any healthier than that first job the super easy saffron flatbread [Music] put the saffron into the bowl and a couple of teaspoons of hot water that starts to infuse the saffron and so you can maximize on the colour across your flatbeds to make the dough simply add plain flour a pinch of salt and pepper to a bowl and then pour in a dash of olive oil that makes the dough nice and silky and rich your saffron water you'll see how concentrated it is now and you'll need cold water then simply need to bring the dough together mop up all your flour you can see now the saffron's activated it's got that really nice color beautiful use your wrist and just knead it nicely we'll do now is smoothing out the gluten strands push and tuck in push and tuck in and each every time you do this getting softer you just sort of form like this perfect beautiful dough it smells delicious that saffron is very powerful now sit that in your bowl cover it with clim film let it rest for 10 to 15 minutes this relaxes the dough making it easier to roll and gives it time to infuse with the saffron i'm gonna cut that into three and then roll them nice and thinly now lightly flour the surface and then just bring that it's like a perfect ball on the board once you've got that nice ball your rolling pin and just roll it out now it doesn't get any simpler than that and just lightly flour that on top a little salt cooking the flatbread is easy just pop in a hot dry pan and they're ready in minutes as it hits the pan it starts the blister she's ready for turning beautiful get that color on there now you want it nice and crisp almost blistering on both sides because it's nice and thin it's cooked once browned on both sides just cool on a rack flatbread's done now on to the muscles now the secret behind cooking great muscles is in the speed you cook the key is to chop and prep your ingredients before you start cooking first thing pancetta i want it quite chunky if you can't get pancetta i always like to use a sort of streaky bacon because i want to sort of render all that flavor at the streaky bacon now tomatoes garlic and chili cherry tomatoes they're just going in whole the garlic just crush the garlic so all that flavor comes out chilli i want some heat in here that's everything prepped now to get it cooked little touch of olive oil pancetta in pancetta takes moments once it's brown and crisp put your garlic chili and whole cherry tomatoes into the pan mussels go in okay and i'm using dry sherry i think it works better in this recipe than white wine which is classically used at this stage then oregano finely chopped stalks and all i'll go on and then just give that a little mix and we'll see those muscles start to open lid goes on you've got to lock in that flavor gotta lock in that heat the mussels will take four to five minutes to steam in the meantime cut your flatbreads into strips crispy and crunchy now the mussels wow that is incredible my goodness me [Music] now that is one lunch i definitely don't want to miss healthy and delicious doesn't get any better than that incredible steamed mussels with saffron flatbreads made in minutes and packed with protein and vitamins this is one fast food meal that really is healthy you

amazing sticky jammy intensity invest a bit of patience and my next recipe pays off big time indulgence and bursting with flavor caramelized figs with ricotta slow cooking can also take desserts to a whole new level a gentle long cook can really bring out that wonderful rich sticky sweetness and that depth of flavor in fruits these are black figs they are suited to slow cooking roasting better than the green fix because this outside skin is so durable this is an amazing way of roasting figs and it's so easy yet so delicious lay your figs out in rows take some rosemary and just peel that down get that really nice fragrant stem get your scissors trim the edge almost we've got a bit of a sort of sharp point bring your three figs together and just thread the top of each fig nice and gently rosemary works wonderfully with sweet dishes as the figs roast in the oven the stalk will impart a lovely subtle flavor useful dust the figs with icing sugar then coat them with a generous splash of basil with leave them to sit there for five minutes and this sort of marinade i know it sounds odd to use vinegar in your dessert but trust me it gives the dish a fantastic sweet and sour taste i'm gonna make a really nice caramel four or five tablespoons of sugar now flatten that out and get it nice and even when the sugar is even caramel cooks evenly it's changing now you can see it melting from the outside in the one thing you don't do is shake the pan rapidly and see it almost like sort of a lake defrosting and it's hitting to the center bubbling still not dark enough yet it's getting there turn the gas down and stay in control let the sugar melt until it turns a dark amber color the secret behind any good caramel is just stopping it from overcooking lovely take that off the gas knob of butter in there just gently whisk in the butter is cooling the caramel down you'll see it changing color to like a cafe lay next add a log of the balsamic vinegar nice beautiful got that nice dark richness of the caramel a little touch of water in there that way the caramel doesn't go too thick now put the caramel back on the heat take your figs and sort of place them in gently lovely and then just add all that lovely little marinade [Music] don't waste that it's amazing stuff there [Music] icing sugar embossed on the vinegar there's something so tasty baste those figs because the skin gets nice and crispy on the outside and the fig sort of just absorbs the caramel delicious so easy now into the oven 190 for 10 minutes [Music] almost doubled in size now look at the color on them the smell is incredible onto your plate they're a lot heavier because they've actually started absorbing that caramel now douse the figs with caramel and serve with ricotta cheese the freshness of that ricotta goes brilliantly well with the figs i'm gonna finish that now with some zest and then some little nibbed almonds and the rich creamy jam texture of the fig with the ricotta is brilliant that is an amazing way of slow roasting fruit and taking figs to a completely new level [Music] the most amazing tata tan are those pink peppercorns they are pink peppercorns they're really good they don't taste anything like black peppercorns quite sweet aren't they they're really sweet very fruity the pink peppercorns give it the sweetness the black peppercorns give the heat now what is that baby vanilla this is one of the easiest desserts in the world to make but one of the most delicious it's a sort of take on the classic apple or pear to tan but when you caramelize those bananas with the peppercorns and the vanilla i bet that tastes amazing oh my goodness incredible okay i'm gonna make the caramel start off with the coal pen first and you just press that butter in there how come do you do it like that and not let it just melt naturally because i want the butter to stay cold because i'm gonna stick the bananas in there okay and then we'll make the caramel and caramelize the bananas at the same time so in goes those vanilla vanilla seeds pods in there as well okay peppercorns done yeah well done good girl sprinkle them over that butter just naturally naturally nice and then look just very carefully sprinkle sugar over that you're doing them all the same size roughly the same size wedge it into the butter well do you know what want the bananas really caramelized you just them between if you crown them in like this okay it will stop them moving around nothing's moving nothing is okay so all wedged in there sprinkle the peppercorns on top of the bananas so you've got that flavor in the caramel and on the top and the bottom right puff pastry puff pastry is difficult and time consuming to make so i always buy ready-made when i'm at home to get the best flavor and texture go for the all-butter type and keep your pastry cold before using it and this is where it gets really exciting you get your fingers you just pinch the end so you thin the end if you can do that for me very carefully you have to be quick because the heat of your fingers can melt the pastry how comes you do it because we get it nice and thin so we can clip it underneath now take a spoon and what we do is lift up that banana and tuck it underneath see lift up a little parcel like a parcel and see the thin bits of pastry yeah how easy it is to get it underneath yeah and that's why you thin them out you do it so quickly well because i have to be quick otherwise the pastry will melt notice how we're not using anything sharp so we're not would that cut the pastry that's right see how locked down that is [Music] gas on we'll start caramelizing that those three little holes are so important if we didn't put a hole in the pastry and it will cause a lot of steam so the pastry never cooks it just goes really soggy okay so really important the caramel is live now we're working the camel give a little shake how can you see the caramel through the pastry look what happens when it tilts oh yeah see all comes running down see yeah i see now that pastry okay is like clinging on to the bananas and so when we turn it upside down we've got this glove full of these caramelized bananas look at that wow it looks like it look a locky look a locky ah looking likey got you now baby you're sorry i'm sorry it's your birthday soon 15. i just worked out on my 50th you're 18. perfect we should do a joint party yeah love it twelve two four for the old ones twelve luncheons have time till four for the old one so they can go to sleep megan will go on later come on perfect here's where i get excited now look at the color of that caramel so tilt the pan again see how dark it is now yeah wow it's going a lot darker now it didn't take long didn't take long at all that's nearly ready for the oven wow look at that so see now where that pastry is caramelising caramel so dark and just a little tip gas back on and that will release it because if you tip it and it's still sticking then some of your bananas will stick yeah so now see when it starts spinning around like that moving around and here we are the moment of truth when you know your daddy is the best chef in the world ready yeah wow look at the vanilla how delicious amazing smells really good as well delicious poached pears i love pizza ready so we're gonna poach them with a little bit of chili chili never heard of that no but a saffron no no no pan on take off a little slice like that so they stand up nicely and then peel okay then and then the chilli you hold that up and just go down yep through and open that up okay into the water seeds in as well seeds them as well oh hollow holes where is that smell it smells so good you got the most amazing are you well yeah a little bit of chilli water and sugar what are they holes saffron is expensive but you only need the tiniest little bit a little pinch to make that water go light and golden star nice how come it's the chinese you've like sliced it at the end and it's not put in whole i want all that flavor coming out of the chili we're gonna make the most amazing star in east dust sorry stars dust so you get your star nice in there seed up and then in see all those little seeds yeah and then you start grinding a little teaspoon of ginger give it a nice mix thank you meg and that's gonna dust the top of the pears once they're cooked ryan get your pears drop them in there and that's what we're going to sprinkle mmm ginger that's darwinis wow what rice is that you're very good that's lovely isn't it so once they're cooked cool down sprinkle that over the top right have you guys got homework yes see you guys come back shortly thank you so much turn that down and let them fall okay bye thank you guys bye after an eight minute simmer our pears should be ready now just get your knife on put the knife through and see how easy the knife is so that means they're soft and cooked now you can leave them in that overnight two or three days all right and they just get darker and more beautiful the good thing about the cooking liquor is that you don't throw that away because you can use that again for re-poaching beautiful i mean they look impressive they smell delicious [Music] look at the colors nice lovely isn't it those are amazing one and just and then take your little star and east dust and just dust over and look at that nice lovely now for my favorite part my next recipe has only two main ingredients but simplicity doesn't mean food can't taste out of this world incredible griddle pineapple with spiced caramel if you're making a dessert for one or two it's gonna be quick and easy this sumptuous delicious griddle pineapple fits the bill perfectly pineapple a way of testing it's nice and ripe top of the leaves come out perfect ready to go always cut a pineapple with a serrated edge knife slice off the bottom turn it back over and slice the top part now keep that for later look at the core the center of the pineapple and slice down directly in half slice that in half take each quarter and slice them smells incredible lay down flat and just slice that core off so you've got this perfect sort of boat of pineapple slice underneath but stop as you get right at the end slicing around the skin will make the pineapple easier to eat but leaving it attached gives you more control as it cooks next heat a griddle pan as hot as you can start off in the corner and push it down so you really mark the pineapple two minutes on each side and then just turn them really nice color man look at that beautiful i'm gonna sprinkle them with a little touch of sugar that's gonna glaze them now slice the top take out these beautiful glazed slices of pineapple there next up the spiced caramel now start off with your pan nice and hot sprinkle four tablespoons of sugar in there just flatten it then add the seeds from a fresh vanilla pod in a small dusting of chinese my spice never stir caramel let it sort of bubble and transform here she goes now i've got the color i want it that's the perfect color off with the gas in with the butter and then a couple of tablespoons of cream lovely and then give that a little whisk add the rest of your cream nice and just drip that spicy caramel over your pineapple [Music] wow simple elegant and seriously impressive griddle

traditionally they're blue inside we'll do a little pika to go and an amazing hang of steak first off season that steak okay when i say season it be quite generous with the salt because i'm gonna lose 30 of it i keep the pepper quite big okay and then tear that off for now and roll that round there roll it all in okay now over to the stove let's get a good char on that hang a steak in she goes now look at that for a fire up and into the pan she goes now i want to sear that okay i've tilted the pan so it's rolling down like that and literally cooking the back of the hanger steak manipulate the steak to the actual shape of the pan because it's searing all around now look at these these are abundance the palace these are the paddles cactus to the naked eye lightly season okay gently rub the most amazing olive oil on there now these are quite robust but once you start cooking them they taste delicious it's almost like a really nice tough sort of salty leathery piece of asparagus straight on to the open grill okay on there and grill that now look at the steak look at that roll that round about two minutes each side and literally the same for the cactus two minutes i want the char on there okay charlie's gonna give a really nice flavor i'm gonna start with the pico de gallo okay let's give a sort of a nice spicy flavored salsa really important for taco it's the base red onion less harsh than the white onion okay down one side and again don't get too precious when you think of the taco it's not about the finesse or the cuts it's all about the flavor so build this thing but don't get too fancy with it i'm going to hit that now with some lime straight away straight off the bat because that's going to make it so fragrant lime zest in okay lime juice in half for now squeeze that in there okay let's get some heat in there beautiful little chili peppers hold that up i want the seeds in there and all you do is put the tip of the knife in and pull it back twist it round pull it back and then literally look go through you've got this beautiful nice dice that goes in onion now we start with that olive oil just a touch to bring it together okay look at those colors that lime is gonna really start kicking in for now let's turn the pales that's what i want a beautiful texture on there now look at my hanger steak roll that round come back to the scallions go quite big we need that beautiful sweet onion flavor cooling down there pico de gallo okay use the greens as well all the tips in there really important now that needs the heat of the cilantro just take the cilantro roll the top around and just chop it once don't go any more than that don't over chop it otherwise you'll lose out on that flavor really important now hit that with a touch more olive oil beautiful and then finally the tomatoes look at that slice them into three seeds again the secret behind any great taco is not getting precious it's the build-up of the flavor the tomatoes gonna give it the sweetness but more importantly it's gonna give that really nice soft cooling effect to the taco down seeds in okay i get so frustrated when you miss out on those seeds now take a spoon and start rolling it around a touch of salt a touch of pepper in there and keep it quite chunky okay i don't want it too wet if it's too wet and as you know it becomes sloppy spoils the tortilla and then finally just take a little blade of garlic okay and just do the same to the garlic as we did with the pepper come down down down down down down come along just like you do with a onion look and we chop the garlic nice and fine that goes in beautiful look at that steak that's nice and rare now i'm gonna take that off okay and then let that sit on there and rest does that rest i want the cooking juices on there look at that beautiful now take my paddle beautiful so lovely let that cool down a touch now the secret now is not to slice the hanger steak immediately okay really important all the way down got a beautiful crunch on there so tasty and then look slice that through that goes in now that peak of the guy is going to go crazy now finish that with a touch of olive oil it's seasoned beautifully it's ready to go we slice that now come down down and down just lightly fan that and then very beautiful corn tortilla now these are traditional beyond belief toast them very very quickly onto the grill here we go on she goes toast them now i say traditionally having the chance to make them this week here and really understand seek of a great masa and the importance of the authenticity and the taste is incredible and the nice thing about this particular tortilla is it absorbs all that juice so think of it as a cushioning but a cushioning with flavor a light toast on there super light beautiful once they've gone slightly curly the side lift them up and place them in to your mould that way as it sets it literally starts to shape a beautiful tortilla shape get them in there and literally in 30 seconds they will set beautifully everything's big in texas everything's bold in texas and everything's in hot in texas honestly i'm sweating like a rabbit stuck down a hole with a rattlesnake the most exciting part first off i'm going to load that up with my peek of the guy okay in that's the base see the importance of keeping that nice and dry look at this beautiful hanger steak see the grains we're slicing on the grain not too thin slice down down down we load that up in in in in a light seasoning from there just a touch of that peak of the guy oh and boy for the final garnish take three slices of your creamy avocado each one and then finally run that left to right i'm going to hit that with a touch of lime beautiful and then take my fresh cilantro twist it from the top slice it once through it don't go back through it just once i want the flavor in the cilantro and then hit it and there you have a proper delicious stunning texas taco with a proper pico de gallo

else you have left for me the secret of a good frittata is in the sausage nice hot pan onions in genus on the onions heat nice and high season fennel seeds to give the onions a really nice flavor everyone's used to cooking sausages whole but it's a really nice way of using them to take them out of their thin skin what we're going to do is crumple all that wonderful spicy fennel sausage into the onions it's going to release all that flavor a lot quicker pretty important to keep that gas nice and high and the longer you caramelise the sausage the more flavor you're going to gain six whole eggs give your eggs a really good mix flat leaf parsley a staple in italian cooking chop it quite rough some parmesan it gives a really nice seasoning fresh pepper a little touch of salt and then get it in there when you fork through it so when you slice it no one's complaining they've got less sausage i'm gonna make it even more italian by topping it with some buffalo mozzarella dry it and then slice it nice and thinly twist it mozzarella in and then finally finish it with that pounds and cheese get the top just as tasty as the bottom my frittata needs three and a half to four minutes under a red hot grill to achieve the best results always ensure your oven or grill are preheated to the perfect temperature she's ready this is the thing i love about italian cooking it's about sharing but always focusing on the ingredients look at that i mean it's incredible a little shake the pan to make sure it comes out and then spatula underneath and just leave it it's light fluffy and it smells incredible and that for me is a dream come true it's amazing how far you can take six eggs and two sausages wow spicy fennel sausage frittata my ultimate italian breakfast it's a cracking start to the day [Music] i go fishing a lot and scotch eggs are the perfect all-in-one mini picnic breakfast first thing get your eggs cooked bring the water up the boil onto the spoon and lower them into the water that way they don't hit the water and crack four and a half minutes that'll keep the center nice and slightly runny now ground sausage meat i'm gonna make mine a little bit spicier i'm gonna crumble in black pudding that helps to season the scotch eggs inside a little touch of salt and pepper and then just to make it a little bit sweeter and a lot easier for the kids to eat some grated apple [Music] combine that blend in the apple and the black pudding eggs once they're cooked drain them and then run them under cold water cracking and cooling the eggs quickly will prevent the yolks turning gray tap them on the side of the pan put them back into the water and what happens the water seeps underneath the shell see the shell come off so much easier eggs still slightly soft in the center i want that little bit of richness with the yolk next you need to get yourself organized with a mini assembly line seasoned flour a little egg wash and breadcrumbs take your mince golf ball size spread the pate manipulate with your thumb and then sit your egg in there and spread the sausage over the egg and you just seal that over really important to keep that nice even coating of sausage meat around the egg you don't want it too thick otherwise it gets too dense and it's unappetizing give them a light dusting in the seasoned flour if you don't put the flour on the egg wash won't stick if you don't put the egg wash on the breadcrumbs won't stick into the egg roll it round shake off any excess egg wash and roll it into your breadcrumbs you can use this same three-stage method to breadcrumb anything you'd like from chicken goujons and fish fillets to fina schnitzel these are panko breadcrumbs japanese white breadcrumb so no crust you can experiment by adding flavors to your breadcrumbs like parmesan herbs or citrus zest i always like to push the actual breadcrumbs into the sausage meat so it gets that really nice golden brown and stops any of the outside burning once breadcrumbed lower the eggs carefully into a four centimeter deep bath of hot vegetable oil for 10 to 12 minutes the eggs are actually cooked soft and running the center so the objective is just to cook the sausage meat and the black pudding they're great don't they go and grenades there's something so magical about a scotch egg on a picnic because it's like this little mini breakfast beautiful drain them onto the paper roll them around just to get off any excess oil and then to transport them some greaseproof paper that for me is the perfect start to the fishing trip there's no wonder i never catch any fish because i'm always too busy eating my scotch eggs [Music] my ultimate black pudding lace scotch eggs an irresistibly delicious picnic breakfast pear and crunchy granola muffins something quite nice when you walk into friends or family's house and you smell a muffin being baked the flour and the baking powder in a nice touch of cinnamon cinnamon muffins goes brilliantly a pinch of salt that's really important for the sort of overall flavor you don't want the muffin to be too sweet muscovado sugar that's a refined brown sugar really rich somewhat spicy and goes brilliantly inside the muffin and then my crispy granola now i'm gonna put half of this in now and save the other half just sprinkle on top of the muffin give that a really good mix in the center i'll have some fresh pear top and tail the pears really important to peel nothing worse when you're trying to enjoy that muffin and you're negotiating with a big sliver of skin of pear slice them round the core four sides and slice it nice and thinly generally muffins contain around half the fat and sugar of cupcakes once the dry ingredients are mixed together you add in the wet two whole eggs nice milk in followed by gently melted butter give that a good mix [Music] add that to your mixture just start folding always do it by hand muffins are delicate dainty little beasts don't overwork your muffin mixture you want that mixture to become nice and relaxed now the mix looks nice and creamy your tray and your little cups and spoon in that mixture two thirds full one nice generous spoon you can tell the mix is right because you've got that even distribution of the pear running from the top to the bottom just gently tap your tray both ends that gets the mix all the way down so they cook nice and evenly take your granola now sprinkle that on top so you got this dual texture spicy pear and this nice crunchy topping makes the muffin taste and feel a little bit more luxurious now into the oven at 180 for 25 minutes beauties [Music] they smell delicious you got that nice crispy top just get them out and let them cool down and i don't have any problems turning vegetarian once or twice a week when i'm having muffins like that nice i smell amazing [Music] a vegetarian breakfast to put hairs on your chest pear and crunchy granola muffins that is a vegetarian delight beautiful eggs bait in hash browns the secret of a great hash brown are the potatoes i prefer using really nice waxy potatoes they cook better but more importantly hold themselves together we're not gonna slice the onion all the potatoes but we're actually gonna grate them the potatoes get really nice and crispy i mean seriously crispy now the onion that way you get that nice balance of the onion flavor running through every little shard of potato [Music] season with salt pepper olive oil and km give that a really good mix through and then squeeze all that water out and look at all that juice we squeeze out there really important the more liquid you remove the crispier your hash browns will be nice large pan put that on once the pan's hot pour in a good glug of olive oil [Music] that sound confirms how important it is to have your pan nice and hot so it seals the grated potato onion together so take the spoon and just pat it down what we're trying to do now is get it really nice and compact going around the outside of the pan with little flecks of butter you just slip them down the back gently and that gets the onions caramelised here's a great tip for turning your hash browns over quick and easy take a plate place it on top and just flip it over and then slide it back in very quickly you see the color we've got on there now you've got that nice crispy texture of the potato i'm going to use the hash brown as a bed for my baked eggs crack in your eggs nice and gently just a little sprinkling of the cayenne to make the eggs a little bit spicy then into a preheated oven for six to eight minutes meanwhile onto my bacon and i'm giving it a classic american twist now one thing i could never get my head around when i first started eating lots of american breakfast was the sweetness from the bacon i've grown up to love that combination of smoky sweet flavors and it's so easy pan on and simply olive oil brown sugar salt and pepper and butter bacon in and as it cooks it becomes irresistibly caramelized and golden brown top of gas and my glazed bacon absolutely ready beautiful now my hash browns and baked eggs are ready wow look at that beautiful just put your spatula underneath there onto your plate and that bacon sets beauty on top of the baked eggs and that hash brown underneath and you can see why the best breakfasts in the world are always in america this is an all-american superhero offer breakfast eggs bait in hash browns with glazed bacon you

smoke there's a big difference see i've got that bright yellow tinge so much better next baby spinach it's a spinach that's very young full of zinc great flavor little teaspoon volleyball knob of butter that little touch of oil stops the butter from burning it looks like a lot of spinach but it's going to disintegrate almost by two thirds i'm cooking spinach in butter i open up the top of my peppermill so the pepper becomes almost like sort of cracked pepper lots of fine once your spinach has reduced down by two thirds add in your cubes of smoked haddock tarragon it's got that nice vinegary flavor quite tart pick off the little buds from the stalks keep hold of these and grateful when you're making a tag and vinegar red wine vinegar tag and stalks in chop your tarragon into your creme fraiche a little seasoning now grain mustard goes brilliantly well with havok incredible this mustardy herbie creme fresh will work equally well partnered with grilled chicken the headache's starting to flake because it's smoked lightly cured it cooks so quickly your creme fraiche it's nice now it's almost like the beginning of the perfect fish pie but as opposed to putting pastry on top the eggs are going to bake on top so you got this wonderful egg crust turn the gas off now crack your eggs around the outside just a little twist of pepper get the remainder of your cream fresh and put a little dollop in between that adds richness to the egg whites into the oven at 180 for 10 to 12 minutes [Music] whilst the haddock and eggs bake together i can knock up a simple spring onion garnish in professional kitchen chefs refuse to use the top of the spring onions but i love that nice dark green flavor it's less harsh than the white the smell of baked mustard you can't beat [Music] that is beautiful spinach was almost melted in with a hat up now just sprinkle your spring onions that gives that really nice sharpness wow my ultimate hearty breakfast smoked haddock and spinach baked eggs so packed with protein and iron you'll be raring to dive into the day ahead [Music] there's something quite nostalgic about a bald egg it's something that's never lost it's magic when you slice that top off and dunk that soldier into the yolk you can't mess with a deliciously runny yolk but this is what i like to dunk in it an anchovy soldier anchovies interpersonal water no salt naturally yeah anchovies are very salty so just a touch of pepper rich in omega-3s the amazing tinned anchovy is a natural flavour enhancer and i use it to pepper many a savory dish from roast lamb to the humble toasted soldier grind them it's a really nice smooth paste the smell of that is almost like being at the seaside now get your soft butter and just put half the butter in first 50 50 is the way 50 percent anchovy 50 butter that way got that real nice salty creaminess mix that up that's absolutely delicious trust me finishing that anchovy butter on a slice of grilled fish i'm in heaven the bread this is a sourdough delicious very crusty take four nice slices now get that pan nice and hot a couple of tablespoons of that anchovy oil into the pan and then get your bread and lightly fry each side the smell of the anchovy oil is incredible take that out now bring your water up to the boil the secret of softly boiling an egg is to place them into the water gently on a spoon in and just tilt so they don't hit the bottom nice and light up to the boil count to five turn the gas down is it four and a half minutes is it five minutes for a softball day i've cooked thousands of them and every time it's four and a half minutes whilst that's boiling get your bread and spread that on there that is incredible chopped parsley brings that kind of freshness goes brilliantly well with the anchovies hear that crunch on inside but i can't resist oh my god right gas off one beauty in two i feel like a five-year-old again this is that moment when you open the vault and that little magic inside is all yours there's a great twist on a great classic wow [Music] perfectly soft boiled eggs with dressed up anchovy butter soldiers who would have thought that egg and soldiers could be that delicious [Music] some of the best food i had in india was street food and every little food stall was cooking up something spicy something delicious a teaspoon of oil gonna toast off a teaspoon of cumin mustard seeds a touch of salt and pepper lightly fry them off it's really important to cook off the spices it intensifies the flavor but really draws out that nice spicy deep rich flavor so onion three fingers one in front two behind nice and fine onions in [Music] now we're gonna caramelize those onions mustard seeds have started to infuse cumin has that nice kick now with a little touch of butter in there get it nice and sort of rich gas up nice and high and really caramelize those onions now once the onions have turned a rich golden color that's what i'm looking for that is beautiful add baby spinach keep that pan nice and hot if you don't cook it out the actual breakfast ends up watering when the spinach is cooked set aside and it's on to the spicy eggs now the breakfast really starts to come alight four nice eggs now give those eggs a little whisk a little touch of butter into the pan a little teaspoon of oil so the butter doesn't burn when the butter and oil are hot add a teaspoon of garam masala and turmeric cook that out now take your eggs into the pan almost gonna make like a really nice spicy scrambled egg turn the gas down now as the scrambled egg comes together just finish that with a little bit of butter i quite like the sort of creaminess makes it so much more delicious and then from there i get my spinach chop up and then fold in the spinach to your scrambled egg something quite exciting about eating spice for breakfast but it's served in these wonderful little thin naan breads this will work with any flatbread or wrap you fancy and then lightly toast your naan take the eggs off the heat whilst you get on with the last job add quick mint and spice yogurt dressing a couple of tablespoons of fresh yogurt in there's always something take out the heat then add chopped mint salt and turmeric mix that in now take a scrambled egg and half fill and now it smells incredible get your yogurt down on top and lift that over and for me that's what really stands out with street food in india how delicious they can make street food with a little bit of spice amazing [Music] once you try this spicy wrap i promise you scrambled eggs will never taste the same spicy mexican eggs this is a very classic mexican style brunch dish bold kick-ass flavors slice the chili seeds in garlic sliced nice and thinly tablespoon of olive oil i'm a big fan of brunches and if you get it right a great brunch can see you right through to dinner now to start the sort of spicy fragrant tomato sauce get your cumin in there garlic chili roasted cumin red onions already sounds mexican once that starts getting really nice and crispy in with your tomatoes never embarrassed using good canned tomatoes i do all the time cooking at home now by reducing that you sort of come down to a delicious paste leave that to simmer next canned beans called black beans these are authentically mexican but cannellini beans or chickpeas will work just fine just rinse some a little bit of water that is beautiful turn off the gas and just let it absorb leaving the dense beans to luxuriate in the spicy tomato sauce will allow them to soften and soak up all the flavor next oil and season an oven-proof dish from my spicy egg brunch to baking i'll just get some of that oil around the outside take your corn tortillas slice them in half and then just stick them to the side these are a staple in mexico take one and place that in the center get your mix and place that on top of the tortilla spread that out nice and smoothly lift up those little flaps i want that crisp shell on the outside now your eggs and cheese get the base of the egg and just make a little hole in there and then crack the egg into there again use a little point put your egg in there one two three four five and one in the middle gently crack and get the egg to sit inside almost like it's a little dug dugout and then one for the center get a really nice rich delicious strong montgomery cheddar i want to grate the tortilla shell as well so get generous with it on the top and we'll season that with these little babies little chili flakes they're my little secret weapon and they're going to spice up that egg just salt a touch of pepper sit that in the oven to bake for 8 to 10 minutes and 180. [Music] [Applause] that smells incredible it's a little bit of coriander to finish it off and that for me is what brunch is all about let's go a fantastic fiery brunch to get your party started spicy mexican eggs and a crispy tortilla shell

powerful incredibly hot but full of flavor garlic two cloves of garlic slice the garlic nice and thin so it helps to puree the chilies in the pest and water garlic in a touch of salt a little touch of sugar in and then start grinding push down first the salt and the sugar really helps the puree the chili and the garlic fish sauce always a base to a chilli sauce two tablespoons in and a touch of rice wine vinegar fish sauce gives it the saltiness the vinegar gives it a nice acidic wake up three tablespoons of olive oil nice mix that up beautiful look at it the colors incredible now spring onions i want the texture and the crunch spring onions in the coriander slice it once in fresh lime and that goes brilliantly with a red mullet just really wakes up the chili the garlic and reminds the sauce that we're serving with fish now taste wow that's delicious look at that beautiful the longer that chili sauce sits there the better it gets now for the peanuts and chili that's gonna coat the top of the red mullet peanuts in salt and that helps to really grind the peanuts down some beautiful dried chili flakes creates a nice sort of warm heat i'm using fresh chili for the sauce but dried chili flakes for the coating which will really crunch up when cooking just a little bit of coriander mix the coriander in to the peanuts and look i like them quite textured i don't want them too small as a powder otherwise they'll burn but crushed lightly to coat the fish with the chili and peanut seasoning in a separate bowl beat two eggs along with a splash of fish sauce take your fillet lay in your red mullet dip it in shake up your peanuts and then in and make sure you push that down cover that red mullet up beautiful now make sure that pan is really nice and piping on if you put the fish in and the pan's cold all those wonderful peanuts and chilli just gonna slide off the fish so we need to sear it in and get it nice and crisp in and lay away from you beautiful [Music] if the pan starts getting a little bit too hot get your olive oil and just place another teaspoon of olive oil around the outside so it starts to heat up as it hits the center and it really helps to stay so much more in control and turn nice and gently we want that nice sort of toasted sauteed crispness which adds a really lovely flavor tilt the pan and just baste the top of the red mullet with that really nice piping hot olive oil you've got that really nice roasted crunch and it goes brilliantly with that soft sweetness of that fish inside get off and just leave them sitting in there and finish with lime and just go over each one now we'll take them out and the sauce will touch on the bottom and the tail of each fish now to round that off serving some fragrant rice sauteed broccoli amazing and there you have a delicious peanut and crusted red mullet with a wonderful sweet chilli sauce cooking with chilis isn't all about blow your head off heat this dish uses the exciting taste of a chili but has a deliciously elegant and subtle flavor first off get that pan really nice and hot these are sirloin steaks sear it in the pan with all that fat on they'll add flavor salt and pepper couple tablespoons of olive oil in pan nice and hot hold up the steak and lay it in always lay away the panna a little shake and it stops the steak from sticking we're looking for color and if it sticks it's gonna burn [Music] while the steaks are cooking i can get on with my super quick marinade now two tablespoons of misood paste that's a fermented soy bean that gives a really nice sort of rich sweetness tablespoon of sugar a couple of tablespoons rice wine that gives it a really nice vinegary kick a couple of tablespoons of olive oil salt and pepper i'm looking for a nice sort of thick rich marinade marinade done it's time to turn the steaks sort the pan and to give the steaks a little base all we're doing every time is just adding more and more flavor take your tongs and sort of lift the steak on its back and really melt all that fat down offer the gas take them out just take your knife see all that fat there just slice that off i don't want any of that now in to the marinade [Music] beautiful tacos are one of mexico's most popular street foods they've been made from beef pork chicken or fish and are loaded up with amazing sauces and spices now i want something sort of pickly cabbage these are chinese cabbages slice it in half look at it really crisp and really tasty we're going to slice that into quarters and then just shred it and take your time you think of cabbage here and you think of sort of braised cabbage nothing worse but at a taco you want freshness a little season of chili flakes they sort of discreetly give it a little bit of heat a little touch of rice wine vinegar if you haven't got that fresh lemon juice a small drop of toasted sesame seed oil give that a really good mix now i need something to sort of bring it together we take some wasabi paste very hot very spicy a sort of thumbnail size i'm gonna mix that with a couple of tablespoons of mayonnaise and give that a really good mix these are basic corn tortilla the trick is to sort of color them and then shape them actually place it on the gas ring use some tongs so it's not to burn yourself you can also toast your tacos in a frying pan from there i'm just gonna place it on the rolling pin literally 30 seconds as it cools down the great thing about serving tacos is people can fill them themselves just the way they want them cabbage just squeeze out wet marinade a nice rustic little mountain mayonnaise on wait you see how soft and delicious and almost sort of melting in the mouth texture we've got on this amazing sirloin it's got that really nice sear around the outside it's just nice and pink in the middle start off with my crispy shell back of the spoon with the wasabi mayonnaise inside taco and just sprinkle that delicious pickled cabbage and then just start lining my taco three or four slices touch more of my spicy layer and that is how i'd make the perfect taco chillis if you use them confidently they can really add a new dimension to the style of cooking but the real trick is finding that balance of flavors that really suits you because that's the most important part so this is the most amazing sirloin you can see it's got that wonderful marble for me the secret behind this is cooking it quickly season the steaks generously salt and pepper push that seasoning in to the sirloin take the soda out the fridge literally 20 minutes before you want to cook them so it gets up to room temperature they cook more evenly but more importantly you can actually season right inside the steak this little bit of fat down here season that as well because that is what we want to roast and get that really nice and rendered olive oil in a tablespoon roll that round as it starts to smoke in with the steaks into the pan and lay away again into the pan and lay away if you don't hear that noise the minute those steaks hit the pan don't put them in so the secret now is getting that color on the steak turning it once and once only and cooking it for two and a half minutes each side what i want to do is to get that bit of fat rendered so it adds a lot more flavor just hold the steak down like that and that starts to melt the fat which makes it so much more tender there should be no white fat left anywhere turn them over really important to have that steak up to room temperature before you start cooking it so the inside is nice and warm so we spend less time in the pan and more time cooling down really important now two fingers touch it goes in says rare i'm happy for them to be rare because by the time i let them rest they're going to go back to medium rare it'll continue cooking out onto a plate and let them rest one two let's get my juices over don't waste that really important next the spicy dressing take the seeds out of the chili to reduce the heat by rubbing it in your hands and tapping until the seeds fall out cut it in half and just chop it in garlic and chilli works brilliantly a quick way of peeling it get your knife and just slam it down pops out very very quickly in a little touch of salt rub start going around in circles first you'll see it pureeing nice clear that off now we've got the heat in there from the chilli and that richness from the garlic two teaspoons of palm sugar this is where it starts to have that nice sweet sour effect fish sauce fresh lime this is a simple fresh chili dressing and it was something i fell in love with in vietnam and cambodia because it was just so easy give that a little mix and dissolve the sugar quick taste wow right vegetables a great fuss-free way to get super thin ribbons of carrot is to use a veg peeler when they're that thin they take the vinaigrette so much better and radishes just slice them down at an angle lovely to give another dimension to the salad i'm gonna use a banana shallot they are incredibly mellow very sweet across just chop up the shallot and mix that through want some sweetness in there now little vine tomatoes slice them in half smart is in shallot radish carrots and tomatoes next peel and slice cucumber chopped spring onions and shred baby gem lettuce and then finally get some fresh mint there's young men so you don't need to take all those stalks off all you do is hold the bunch upside down and then take it for a little trim and just chop that once through look at that nice minted salad a couple of tablespoons of dressing don't flood the salad with the dressing we can always add but we can't take it away now really mix that dressing in there make sure all that chili and garlic and palm sugar wraps around that salad beautiful onto the plate the steak's rested it's now nice and medium rare a little bit of fat we don't want to find that in the salad just slice that off that serves its purpose it's kept that steak nice and moist just slice going with the grain it's almost like slicing through butter and look inside beautiful pink you slice the beef too thinly then it goes stone cold and more importantly all the goodness runs out of it nice thick slices get the beef and start placing it around the salad take a little teaspoon of your dressing the rest of your salad sip that on top we'll finish it off with some toasted peanuts peanuts in now those nuts are really toasted nuts on get another pan and just crush once they've cooled down just run them through with a knife they can hear how crunchy they are another texture another taste the salad and then from there sprinkle and then finally take that just finish it with a little tablespoon of that sauce and there is one tasty very well textured spicy beef salad [Music] you

If...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, [Music] halloumi is a firm springy salty cheese with his roots firmly in cyprus and grease the betalumi is made from sheep's milk rich in vitamins and essential nutrients is thought to promote longevity halloumi keeps for many months if stored unopened in the fridge and its high melting point makes it brilliantly adaptable perfect for grilling barbecuing and frying i'll be championing this texture lending marvel for my yummy vegetarian lunch dish of halloumi courgette and herb cakes as a chef i'm never sniffy about cooking with vegetables because i know that with a bit of care and attention they can be turned into something absolutely stunning for my ultimate vegetarian lunch i've got a couple of fantastic recipes lightly fried my delicious halloumi and courgette cakes squeeze every last bit of flavor out of those vegetables but first i'm preparing a simple slow roast tomato and watercress salad these cherry tomatoes are perfect if you haven't got cherry tomatoes vitamins are good or even just big normal plump tomatoes lay the tomatoes on the tray and these go into the oven for about 90 minutes if you turn the oven down really low you can leave them in overnight to be honest the longer you leave them the better they taste once you've seasoned them with salt sprinkle over with some sugar and the salt and sugar combine speeds up the drying process because you want that nice chewy texture and then you get these little time flowers and just pick off the buds garlic sliced then just spread that on now the tray looks quite full and compact but 90 minutes in the oven you'll see everything shrink down all the skins blistering and the flavor intensifies so nicely extra virgin olive oil that gives a nice earthy flavor to the tomatoes place your tomatoes into an oven preheated to 150 degrees c and cook long and slow for an hour and a half now halloumi cakes there's something quite exciting about halloumi cheese it's a very firm cheese and it fries brilliantly peel the carrots [Music] great not too finely you want that nice texture next courgette the secret is it all grated the same put that into a sieve [Music] a sprinkling of salt will draw out liquid from the vegetables then grate the halloumi halloumi cheese doesn't look that tasty but once you've got color on it in the pan it's really really delicious now really important to squeeze out the excess water from the veg and we'll see all that water that needs to come out of there if you didn't do this it will make your little patties non-friable because the whole thing starts to separate and then mix in with the cheese spring onions chop up the whites and the greens now we're going to season that with some delicious fresh mint and fresh coriander whenever it's vegetarian i like to put a combination of herbs in there tarragon parsley mint coriander basil and lemongrass all delicious on their own but in tandem their flavors play off each other next two eggs in give that a little mix add the eggs to the mixture and then finally a couple of tablespoons of breadcrumbs the breadcrumbs help dry out any excess moisture mix all the ingredients together before you start shaping these taste the mixture it's really important to identify the seasoning now if you wait until you've cooked them it'll be too late to adjust the seasoning roll them to a large golf ball shake them like a little mini burger you could spice these up with some chili in there if you haven't got fresh chili chili flakes and it's something that can be done up a day in advance to get your cakes firm and ready for frying put them into the fridge uncovered for 25 minutes pan on get that nice and hot whilst i'm waiting for that i'll get the dressing ready slice the red chili seeds and all on an angle into shards then chop fresh ginger season with a sprinkle of sugar and salt add some rice wine vinegar add a couple of tablespoons of olive oil to finish off some chopped coriander [Music] got that sweet sour spicy flavor with my chili dressing done i can start frying off my halloumi cakes in a hot oiled pan we get a nice crisp edge you can already start to smell that sauteed halloumi with the courgettes and carrots smells delicious really important for a nice amount of color on them as my cakes sizzle away i can finish off my roast tomato salad one of my favorite leaves has to be watercress it's cut off stalks [Music] shallot rings watercress and shallot go brilliantly well together the shallot looks so dainty when you open up these little ringlets [Music] don't forget to turn your cakes now tomatoes whatever you don't use just jar them and put them in the fridge [Music] just drop those slow cooked warm tomatoes over the watercress the sweetness is incredible absolutely delicious a little drizzle of age of smoked vinegar gives that tartness to the watercress watercress is naturally peppery so it doesn't need any pepper just a little touch of salt and then a light sprinkling of extra virgin olive oil after five minutes on a medium heat my halloumi cakes are ready so important to have taken out that water [Music] you can see it doesn't disintegrate and then just get your dressing take a spoon of it and then tilt it to the side because i want the garnish i don't want the juice if that does not turn you on to become a vegetarian for the night i honestly don't know what will delicious [Music] my crispy golden halloumi courgette and herb cakes with a sumptuous roast tomato and watercress salad all of the flavor with none of the meat murgues and fontina stuffed croissants okay big and bold i was living in france i stayed there for three years once twice a week i treated myself to the most amazing bold breakfast and it started off with these beauties here murgays cheap but incredibly tasty start off with a nice hot pan mug is in it's a very spicy sausage doesn't need any help doesn't need any chili just a touch of salt and pepper you can smell the spice let's start to release all that wonderful oil that flavor in there add a couple of cloves i'll finely slice garlic spread the garlic across the pan it instantly changes color takes on this nice dark rich golden color now take a look at the heat out with the parsley the stalks of soft herbs like parsley and coriander can be used to impart flavor during cooking but the leaves should always be added just before serving to give maximum color and fragrance [Music] and then finish that off with my capers amazing all right beautiful now take your quests on they're literally 24 hours old so they're crispy on the outside and just slice off the lid this recipe is a great way to use up any leftover croissants from the day before i used to cringe when i saw the french cooks throw away croissants i used to cry thinking oh my god any idea what you're throwing away in terms of flavor whatever you do do not wipe out that pan dunk your croissants mopping up all that amazing flavor and caramelizing the inside for that beautiful and don't forget the lids and then get your thumbs and go inside the croissant all i want to do now is just create a little pocket and just manipulate the crescent now this is where it gets exciting mix up the capers the garlic and sausages look at the color of that wonderful delicious flavoured oil now some cheese but not just any cheese fontina cheese is like the number one cheese for grilling and because it's a very rich cheese you shave it thinner than you would a white truffle but it gives a really nice saltiness and a light smoky flavour salt place these big boys on the tray literally 30 seconds on the grill here we go nice crisp packs full of flavor now top them and that for me it's almost like being back in paris except this time i don't have to share them with the french my ultimate big and bold breakfast murgies and fontina stuffed croissants a great way to start the day spicy black beans with feta and avocado [Music] first in a pan heat olive oil add chopped onion and fry until soft then finely slice garlic and chili add cumin cinnamon and black beans then combine cook together until deliciously soft these small beans come dried or in tins and they're a great cheap ingredient to make dishes more substantial to serve dollop the black bean mixture on crunchy tortillas topped with cubed ripe avocado chopped fresh coriander and crumbled salty feta cheese spicy black beans with feta an avocado a dish has filling frugal and tastes fantastic my next great veg recipe is leaking greer rusty with fried eggs [Music] in a hot pan sweat shredded leeks along with a knob of butter and seasoning next great par ball potatoes and grill a hard swiss cheese with a great nutty flavor then combine with the softened leeks in a pan heat oil and a little butter spoon in the potato leek and cheese mix cook gently until golden and crisp underneath then slide onto a plate flip over and return to the pan to finish cooking [Music] finally for the perfect topping fry two eggs and place them on top of the rosty top with fresh tarragon [Music] leaking grill rusty with fried eggs a simple but substantial dish that makes the most of hearty root veg what could be more classically british than the cheese that's been produced here since the 12th century cheddar originally made in the caves of the cheddar gorge in the west country it's still far and away the uk's cheese of choice in britain cheddar outsells all the other cheeses combined good quality cheddar has an amber yellow hue and it's firm but not greasy or hard a dish becomes a classic because it's delicious and somehow strikes a cord with us it just works sometimes these dishes can become tired but a clever twist helps make them fresh again you can't get more classic than a centuries-old midday meal of bread cheese and beer reinvented and marketed by pubs as a plan was lunch in the 60s i'm now giving it my 21st century take like plum ones with the most amazing but super simple beer baked bread hearty and full of flavor for a really quick and easy bread dough sieve a mix of wholemeal and self-raising white flour with a good pinch of salt salt is really important to breath it's the first thing i do once i've cracked it and smelt you want to smell that salt baked throughout beer in about 250 mils of beer [Music] the reason why this recipe works so well is it the beer it's got that yeast so naturally it's going to work beautifully give that a really good mix i'm looking for the mixture to be quite wet if the dough becomes too firm then it's gonna cook dry in the center just as it starts to fall through the whisk that is perfect beautiful this mix will work really well as one large loaf but i want to make my plum ones a little bit more special small tins give it that kind of intimacy and i quite like having my own little loaf give the molds a really nice lining with butter make sure you butter the top now tablespoon of flour dust inside the mold that will stop your mixture sticking tap out any excess three-quarters fill your little moulds we're gonna allow it to sort of rise just so it comes above the mold and forms this really nice miniature loaf onto the tray centimeter apart into the oven 25 to 30 minutes at 180. something quite nice about the smell of home-baked bread in the kitchen delicious no plan was it's complete without pickled onions red onion is a lot sweeter less harsh than a white onion the early days of plum and you've got those ghastly sharp pickled onions that make you almost cry when you're crunching them i'm gonna lightly pickle my red onion just push your fingers through so you get these nice sort of onion rings a little touch of salt and sprinkle the sugar and then a couple of cloves in there that gives it a really nice sort of perfume and sort of makes the pickling slightly more mellow red wine vinegar now if you haven't got red wine vinegar white wine vinegar it's just as good but red matches the red onion so it goes hand in glove a couple of tablespoons of vinegar just give that a really good mix to speed up the pickling process use a weight to put pressure on the onions as the weight presses down on the onions the clove the salt the sugar the vinegar worked their magic and it comes out with a really nice light fragrant pickle for my 21st century plants i'm creating an all-in-one salad and bringing the traditional elements together with a punchy dressing a tablespoon of english mustard a tablespoon of honey a touch of salt and pepper and finish off with white wine vinegar and olive oil [Music] now generally it's sort of three parts oil to one part vinegar that's the sort of general base [Music] you don't really think of a vinaigrette with a plan ones but this is a really nice sort of modern approach to plan ones for my plan one salad i'm using a mixture of robust and crunchy romaine lettuce and punchy watercress if i was making a watercress soup i'd use the stalks but the stalks are a little bit bitter so i just grab them like that pinch them and then twist [Music] very peppery very hot but so juicy watercress in your celery chop it nice and finely it's the one thing that everybody leaves is that stick of celery so scatter it amongst the salad a bit of oomph and color from some sliced radishes and sweetness from a thinly sliced apple whilst you're busy throwing your plum and salad together do not forget about your beer bread before it comes out i'm gonna glaze the top with a little touch of milk that'll put a really nice finish to the bread back in for the last five minutes now for the magic and the plain ones generally you'll see it as a ham or cheddar or stilton players it's hard to dictate which one's the best so for the ultimate plowman's i'm adding all three with your cheddar peel some nice shards of that delicious creamy cheddar just get them dancing on top the dressing drizzle ran in circles and then finally our delicious lightly pickled onions give them a good squeeze and look just dot the onions around bread it's ready it's got that nice yeasty smell warm crusty and delicious there you go that is my classic modern version of a traditional stunning ploughman's wow [Music] my delicious all-in-one plan one salad with individual beer bread loaves updated for the 21st century [Music]

Gordon Ramsay's Ultimate Fit Food/Healthy, Lean and Fit – http://po.st/REpVfP...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, these delicious spicy pancakes are really great alternative but more importantly so easy to do start off by toasting your cumin [Music] it's a dry roast basically non-stick pan just a touch of seasoning the salt helps to dry out the cumin even more and then fresh ginger slice them nice and thinly stack it back up and then just slice nice little thin slices in there and then keep that bunched up shake the chilli removing the seeds will prevent things getting too hot now garlic nice now add olive oil to your toasted cumin seeds and then with the garlic ginger and chili lovely and it feels strange when you talk about garlic for breakfast but the time i spent in india everybody was eating something savory for breakfast it was extraordinary into your bowl and set aside next the pancake filling add olive oil to a hot pan mustard seeds in now they'll start dancing the minute they hit the pan then finally slice an onion onions in a little teaspoon of turmeric sprinkle that in and look at the color an instant change leftover potatoes just slice them the smell is incredible potatoes in now spread the potatoes across the pan while the potatoes stained i want them sort of absorbing all that really nice turmeric actually like a sponge season those potatoes it really helps to bring out the spice beautifully they're ready turn off the gas and let them sit there and absorb all those flavors back to the pancake batter add plain flour to your cooled garlic chili ginger and cumin seeds a touch of salt and pepper nothing worse than the bland pancake one whole egg milk hold the jug with one hand and whisk we have a secret to get that really nice smooth paste but whisk in that egg first and brings it together and then you're milking don't put all the milk in because then you're gonna get a lumpy pancake mix and if you put less milk in it really helps it not going lumpy look at that milk here and the secret for me is to have a nice thin mix now just a little teaspoon of oil that helps to bring a nice crispy edge to the mixture now just taste that's the texture pan on the larger the pan the better it helps to create a nice thin even surface i want that mix going all the way around the pan before you put the mixture into the pan make sure you give your pancake mix a really nice stir pan it's nice and hot turn down the gas a touch of olive oil in get that nice whisk with one hand pan to the mix in one and a half ladles and then roll it around so it's really nice and thin i want to see the ginger the garlic that's what i'm looking for in there now back onto the heat it only starts to remove from the bottom of the pan and lifts itself up once it's cooked these little bubbles confirm that it's just starting to lift off the pan a little shake that releases it and then just shake it to the end and toss if you haven't got the confidence tossing then use a spatula and turn it over now that's exactly what i want that nice sort of crisp edge around the side the colour on the pancake is so important now roll it round and just let it slide out beautifully now for the exciting part filling them take your potatoes just sort of have a really nice imaginary line and then just very carefully roll that nice and tightly tuck it underneath there pull it back and roll useful the delicious pancakes are ready to eat but with a simple dipping sauce there'll be a real treat just mix chopped coriander with natural yogurt that's really nice cooling asian sit there on the side and that for me is a great brunch delicious spicy pancakes amazing [Music] chicken stir-fry with rice noodles some of the best street food i've ever eaten was in asia every one of those little markets was filled with smells of delicious food that all centered around an asian staple noodles learn to cook those properly and you'll be surprised how quick and easy it is to knock up a delicious dinner first off we're gonna soak our noodles now these are rice noodles into a bowl and just pour the hot water over the rice noodles soak and rehydrate 12 to 15 minutes to soften up if you've got a wok perfect if not just a normal sized frying pan with big sloping sides pan on get it really nice and hot chicken breast very lean hardly any fat on there you've got this little fillet just slice that off now the secret to getting it really nice and thin and to cut it into strips take your knife keep it nice and flat on the board and sort of slice it in half like a sort of scallop like that we call this butterfly in the chicken take a rolling pin and nice and gently roll over the chicken what it does it sort of flattens it allows you to slice it even thinner and the thinner the slice of the chicken the sort of crispier it gets the quicker it cooks slice it in half start slicing these nice thin slices and the good news is one chicken breast can serve two or three easily next wash your knife and finally slice garlic the thinner the garlic the crispier this is a young tender broccoli just slice them down i want a bite to the broccoli and normally you sort of paste the dish with one-third noodles one-third vegetables and one-third of your protein chicken with a dish that takes literally minutes to put together it's really important to get everything organized everything needs to be at your fingertips touch of olive oil get a pan really nice and ready just starting to smoke drop the chicken in first salt pepper open up those little strands of chicken nice [Music] once you've started to sear off the chicken get the garlic in now let that get really nice and crispy the way to do it is to sort of spread all the chicken the garlic up the side of the pan and see why it's so important to cut the chicken thin strips because it colors and cooks at the same time as well really really crucial now that garlic's getting really nice and crispy broccoli in feels strange putting raw broccoli in like that normally we blanch it in boiling water dry it out but you want that crunch now soy sauce that helps to season it but also stains beautifully soy sauce in lovely it's exactly what i want now take that out give you a pan a little wipe out a little teaspoon of olive oil get that wok really nicely oiled again drain your noodles they're beautiful this is a really exciting way of finishing this quick stir fry very classic two eggs in whisk up the eggs and give that a really good whisk sort of almost spread it out the side of the pan lightly season the eggs noodles in chicken and broccoli in [Music] and give that a really nice mix i want the egg to sort of almost bring the dish together that egg's cooked make sure you've got that nice even distribution of chicken broccoli garlic lovely and then just finish that fresh lime and then you have a very simple delicious stir-fry with rice noodles [Music] smoky pork sliders with barbecue sauce everyone loves a burger they're a true fast food original and that's the exciting thing about street food you can take an old classic like that and reinvent it into something really exciting when you think of a burger what you need is a great sauce and a light smoky barbecue goes hand in glove with a great burger start by finely chopping one onion and three cloves of garlic nice hot pan tablespoon of olive oil onions and garlic into the pan nice seasoning salt and pepper now the secret of a good barbecue sauce is that really important caramelization to begin with a nice tablespoon of brown sugar it darkens the onions but it really starts to sort of give that nice syrupy body to the sauce i put a little bit of heat in there now a nice teaspoon of smoked paprika that's the important part of working with spices you've got to cook them out and almost sort of burn off that rawness especially with a smoked paprika that's exactly where i want it to go onions and garlic beautifully caramelized cider vinegar in reduce that down now i've got a fantastic smoky base to complete the sauce i'm making my life really easy and adding pre-made worcester sauce and tomato ketchup cook that out for two to three minutes now depending on how thick you like the barbecue sauce that determines how long you cook it out for i don't want it to be too runny but i don't want it too thick either that's the consistency we're looking for lovely turn down the gas charger seasoning now take that out it's the kind of sauce that i like to have sort of bottled up in the fridge it's great for sandwiches but goes brilliantly well with these sliders homemade smoky barbecue sauce [Music] give the pan a little wipe now start the mix for the sliders to give my mix a really interesting flavor and texture i'm gonna be using unsmoked back bacon i travel all over the world and i spend a lot of time in the states they know how to make a great slider pork sliders beef sliders chicken sliders and it's almost like a way of having a burger but on a much smaller miniature level a little teaspoon of olive oil i want that bacon to get really nice and crispy bacon in this just gives the really nice sort of chunky delicious mix i want texture and pork is perfect for a slider [Music] and choppy shallot slots are a lot sweeter than your normal white onion fine fine fine and in [Music] now that bacon's getting really nice and crispy i want a bit of heat in there a little teaspoon of smoked paprika in there when you see these sliders in the states for one portion there's like four or five of them little mini one biters incredible now take your pork just open it up and give that a really nice seasoning so important you can't season a slider after you've cooked it it's impossible so season it nicely bacon now that's nice and crispy just take a little touch kitchen roll and just drain that off there [Music] nice pat that nice and dry i want all that nice sort of crispiness in there beautiful mix all that in take a nice ball and sort of roll it size of a golf ball get it nice and round first and then three fingers just pat that down don't flatten them too thin otherwise they overcook and they go sort of dry because sliders are bite-sized burgers designed to go in small buns you don't want to make them too big good get the pan nice and hot a tablespoon of olive oil when a slider is literally that thick about an inch thick we're going to take two and a half to three minutes to each side in turn them over lovely once you've turned them tilt the pan and just spoon all that juice back into them keep my mouth watering now very easy to dry the pork out so just feeling it now your fingers is nice and firm it's a little touch of springiness in the center i'm happy with those add your cheese now so it gets nicely melted i'm using wedges of smoked cheddar and it has that nice sort of soury smoky creaminess to the slider finally shredded baby gem lettuce just take those buns make sure they're sliced nice and evenly take your lettuce be quite generous when the lettuce just a nice thin slice of tomato take your burgers you see that cheese you feed melted your bbq

If you liked this...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, and one of my all-time favorites a dish that always creates a stir is the daddy of all brunches steak sandwiches [Music] for me the secret of a great brunch is fun and casual fuss-free cooking and everyone helping themselves this is the ultimate steak sandwich you want the rolls royce of beef it has to be fillet now season it beautifully i like to open up the top of the peppermill to increase the size of the pepper in the steak so it gives that bit of heat nice little chunks you just roll now nicely all the way around now slice the garlic in half pan nice and hot olive oil in hold the steak and just place it into the pan don't drop it at the front of the pan we're going to tilt the pan forward to cook the back of the steak dual purpose now roll it back and sear underneath next my garlic and roast that garlic thyme fry that time i want to hear it we're not looking for a lot of color because you're going to dry out the fill it so just one end turn it back down and steer the other end in lift up your time place it on top of the garlic there lift up your fillet and sit there on top of your garlic butter in take a spoon tilt the pan gently lift up and baste i've got that scented garlic thyme flavor the steak is going to cook evenly because it's sat on a little a little bed in the oven for 8 to 10 minutes [Music] pan on for the relish you think of a steak sandwich you think of a sort of nice heated tomato relish to make the relish finely dice a red onion three finger rule one in front two behind through and chop wow next roughly chop a chilli keeping the seeds in for extra heat start off with the olive oil into a pan onions chili [Music] generous with the olive oil i want a nice sort of rich silky relish from there take your tomatoes you can't just use red tomatoes but these yellow and red make the perfect combination now put your salt in cut them and then roast those tomatoes off take a wooden spoon and just sort of break them up once the skins blister the whole tomato just starts to release all that really nice sweet texture a little teaspoon of cherry vinegar gives that nice acidic balance the sweetness of the tomatoes turn down the gas and just let them sort of stew perfectly now a steak sandwich would not be complete unless it had the most amazing mustard mayonnaise simply add three tablespoons of mayonnaise to three teaspoons of whole grain mustard [Music] now i've got the reddish almost down to like a really nice jam now i want to make that relish a little bit more fragrant some basil slice it through sprinkle that basil in there [Music] beautiful look at this there she is my crown jewels time to take it out smell is incredible just baste one more time to fill it the touch is quite soft in the center so it's just coming up to mid-rare let it rest the same time you cooked it it'll be nice and pink evenly throughout the steak to make my sandwich i'm going to char grill some sliced chipatta bread season it nicely just a little drizzle of olive oil i want to get that bread nice and crispy pan nice and hot bread in push it down smell is amazing that char sort of charcoal flavour once you've got those marks on the bread it just stops the bread from becoming soggy and look at this here it is stunning on slice it gently one beautiful slice wow it's nice and pink all the way through and the beef is so soft it's almost like slicing through butter let the knife do the work take a little bit of mayonnaise spread that the back of the spoon on both sides next lettuce take that beautiful slice of beef and then relish on top of that beef and just slice the sandwich in half beautiful now that's what i call a steak sandwich trust me serve the sublime sandwich for brunch and you'll put a smile on everyone's face [Music] my next easy standby supper is beef meatball sandwich with melting mozzarella and tomato salsa [Music] top a lightly toasted roll with pan-fried meatballs then tear off chunks of creamy buffalo mozzarella pile it on and melt it under the grill for the tangy salsa slice sweet red onion then add juicy diced tomatoes and roughly chop fresh coriander season and drizzle with olive oil spoon over [Music] perfect in a flash beef meatball sandwich with melting mozzarella and a tomato salsa a sandwich to die for [Music] melting my lunch when i was growing up was very plain pretty trashy but i still love it now and again fish fingers with a delicious chip butty the secret of a good chip butty is in the potato now these are desiree potatoes one of my first ever jobs was working in a chip shop i used to put sacks and sacks of potatoes into the rumbler which was then the potato peeler all day long today i'm going to do something a little bit healthier for my oven chips with a twist simply peel slice and blanch for three to four minutes drain season and cover well with propeca spread evenly over an oiled baking tray and place into a preheated oven for 20 minutes simple as that next up easy fish fingers this is pollock a really nice firm delicious fish got the fish in finger size batons of fish put them onto your plate and just lightly salt them you can do that literally 20 minutes 30 minutes before you start cooking the fish it firms the fish up beautifully and it allows it to become a little more durable especially in the pan now for the coating start by thoroughly coating the fish in seasoned flour and then just roll it to get rid of those little sharp corners because then it stops those corners almost burning in the pan in to your egg wash and really coat them wonderful and then this is dill goes brilliantly well with a fish and run the dill through my breadcrumbs that makes it more aromatic lay them onto your breadcrumbs nothing wrong with the chip butty nothing wrong with fish fingers just give it a lovely modern twist beautiful once the fish fingers are thoroughly coated they're ready to pan fry and they'll need around three minutes on each side i want the fish fingers to be nice and crispy get a really nice color on them first and then we'll flip them over and finish them with butter bring the heat up into the pan and a nice little knob of butter that'll work wonders with the breadcrumbs and the dill nice and carefully take them out they look and smell incredible stay nice and crispy now to assemble my chip butty starting with buttered thick crusty bread get a slice of bread mop up that amazing flavor on slice in half never slice in an angle my mouth is salivating beautiful on with the ship butti there's one thing missing and it signifies that i've never forgotten the joy i've come for food but my god that makes me feel like a nine-year-old excuse me for a moment when you want to stuff my face [Applause] [Music] homemade fish fingers and my ultimate chip buddy so simple to make but trust me it tastes amazing [Music] this is a picnic sandwich with a twist but the secret is in the layers i'm gonna make a delicious tapenade a puree of olives seasoned with capers and anchovies a nice tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil garlic in a little teaspoon of red wine vinegar that just sort of zaps up the flavor quite like leaving it nice and chunky tastes better and feels richer i much prefer spreading a smooth layer of tapenade rather than using butter now to prepare my first mediterranean sandwich filling i want nice long slices of courgette because yes can be a bland vegetable season them nicely once that grill's nice and hot a tablespoon of olive oil the more color you put on those courgettes the more flavor while my griddle courgette's cool i can prepare the bread this is a stunning beautiful country loaf but we're not gonna slice it i'm just gonna cut the top off because i'm assembling a picnic sandwich basket and then an inch from the crust and go around scoop out a nice large hollow don't waste this bread put that out to dry it makes the most amazing bread crumbs the secret now is filling that cavity with all those wonderful mediterranean flavors i'm going to leave them to sort of sit and marinate lightly season the inside of the loaf drizzle of olive oil line with that wonderful tapenade and spread it generously puts the groundwork in starts to set the tone for the flavors that we're incorporating traditionally the main protein in pambanya would be tuna i'm sticking with the med but replacing the fish with some of my family's italian favorites palmer i'll start lining my sandwich from the center every time i add another ingredient it's just another stunning layer of texture and flavor but what i'm thinking about is what actually complements the next layer mozzarella a little spoon of my tapenade we've got the most amazing tequila pepper so we've got a nice smoky barbecue flavor open them up and lay them on top next layer these wonderful grilled courgettes on top of that some blush tomatoes concentrated but really chewy and delicious and each time lightly press them down creamy mozzarella again and then finally peppers push that down not too firm fold in and seal that with your tapenade almost like a little glue now lid on to seal all that flavor in there and not only travels well but actually tastes delicious that is one stunning picnic sandwich next a brilliant picnic salad that's just as robust as your pan bun yeah carrots and cumin and orange perfect combination again travels brilliantly it doesn't wilt it doesn't disintegrate orange zest [Music] squeeze the orange over sunflower seeds a bit of crunch in there pumpkin seeds again another bite next a hint of spice toasted cumin seeds ground with the help of a little coarse sea salt a nice fine powder now for the dressing tablespoon of dijon mustard tablespoon of honey half a tablespoon of white wine vinegar and then a nice glug of olive oil fresh mint and coriander the minute you start picking fresh herbs all that flavor comes out a nice mix vinaigrette mix that in give enough dressing bind it together excite the palette not drown it if it was a leaf salad then i'd take the dressing separately but because this is a robust root vegetable they can sustain being dressed now and eaten in two hours time sweet spicy fragrant can't really ask much more from a carrot can you beautiful [Music] just when your guests think that you're cutting up a delicious country loaf [Music] look at that baby wow and who would not want to join you on a picnic with a sandwich like that my ultimate picnic lunch to surprise and impress panbania bursting with rich sunshine flavors and serve with a refreshingly zingy carrot cumin and orange salad [Music]

If you...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, chocolate is the key ingredient in my favorite sweet fast food dishes which at their best are always irresistible instant and utterly satisfying so when you want an indulgent chocolate hit my next recipe will be right up your alley malt chocolate doughnuts street food is all about satisfying your cravings these donuts are sweet sticky and absolutely delicious first off we're gonna make the dough now this dough takes a bit of time but it's really exciting i'm heating all of the milk with the sugar this yeast easy to get hold of now when you make fresh donuts you need fresh yeast adding some of the warm milk to the yeast will activate it which will help the dough to rise just half give that a quick whisk the sugar's dissolved in the milk the fresh yeast disintegrates instantly set the yeast mixture to one side while it does its job to start the main dough mix i'm adding half the butter to the remaining milk that gives the dough a nice silkiness i want it light so melt the butter into the milk flour into a sieve that helps to make the dough nice and smooth and you know when you've got a smooth dough it sort of rises evenly add a pinch of salt and two egg yolks pour in the warm milk and melted butter don't start over mixing it when you over mix the dough of the doughnut it gets really tight you're not gonna let it ariel yeast in nice and warm i love that smell now i'm looking for a sort of elasticy texture just dropping off the spoon nice flour the board take the dough out lovely lightly sprinkle a touch more flour and just pull it over and push in every time you're sort of turning it almost like you're turning the dough into itself the dough should just sort of relax and it shouldn't be sticking to your fingers now it's just nice and pliable set that in a nice clean bowl it will sprinkling flour in there so as it starts to rise it doesn't stick cover that with thin film leave the dough to rise in a warm place for 60 to 90 minutes until it's doubled in size this stage is called proving now whilst that's proving get a panel for the chocolate filling or ganache pour 500 mils of double cream into a saucepan and add honey [Music] bring the mixture to a gentle boil [Music] traditionally we've always put jam in there but chocolate and donuts wow to die for add the cream i give that a good mix the butter elevates the ganache into a really nice shiny chocolate coat look at that whoa give it a really nice whisk the whistling gives it that aerated texture to ganache you're just lightening the load a little bit nice chocolate filling done put it in the fridge to cool then it's time to gently roll out the dough just let it roll naturally about a centimeter and a half in depth slice one two place them on to your tray and let them rise again once the donors have had 30 to 40 minutes to rise it's time to shallow fry them in a pan filled one third full with hot vegetable oil risen but look they're sort of like little pockets of air right here we go place these in nice and carefully four maximum if there's too many in the pan the oil will go cold and the donuts will come out soggy turn them over beautiful i gotta come out into some sugar mixed with some malt powder 50 50. how do you tell they're actually cooked in the center tap on top it should be hollow in and just sprinkle the malt and the sugar shake off the excess i get so excited every time i make donuts now look at those beauties these are delicious eating as they are but the ganache is going to be the icing on the cake piping bag peel the bag over your hand don't forget to pop the nozzle in i want the texture almost like a little liquid inside so i'm going to pipe them in a little bit warm hopefully with that burst of magic operation donut lift up the donut squeeze push in and fill just to start seeing that chocolate coming out sit that back down [Music] nice sit them on there they've got a little bit heavier and we all know why nice that one's got my name on it that is amazing [Music] in great bacon as with all cooking sometimes less is more the easiest dishes look and taste spectacular when they're done well and it doesn't come any simpler or more stylish than my next dish wonderful baked cheesecake for me food always has to be impressive but when it comes to desserts often you see spun sugar or wild decorations remember simple is always the most impressive this cheesecake is so straightforward yet so delicious now cream cheese leave it out the fridge for five or ten minutes go nice and soft trust me your arms will be thanking you sugar in this cheesecake is new york cheesecake because it's baked so there's no base start creaming the cheese and the sugar spending the amount of time i do in the states if there's one thing they know how to do out there is the most amazing impressive cheesecake rich delicious but so simple work the bowl lift the bowl to your advantage really whisk whisk whisk whisk lovely nice and creamy now get your eggs add the eggs to the mixture bit by bit doing it this way it's more efficient hey you're incorporating a lot of air b the mixture doesn't separate the last of your egg lovely of course you can use electric mixer but why go to the gym we can just make a cheesecake a day a cheesecake a day keep the bingo wings away now a couple of tablespoons of flour give it a whisk stop something going lumpy now i want to scent that cheesecake i've got the freshness zest of the lemon in there i want to sort of tart it up even more fold in some fresh raspberries so just mix them through be careful to crush them then grease a cake tin with butter this will ensure your cheesecake slides out beautifully get your mix let that fall in now take your cake tin and just tap it the mixture hits the bottom of the cake tin the raspberries rise and you've got raspberries at the top the middle and the bottom it also stops all these little pockets of air trapping underneath the mixture in the cake tin there's no holes in the cheesecake now into the oven 180 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes [Music] slightly souffled up pull off that's the color i wanted on top and look at it it's one of the simplest yet the most stylish cheesecakes anywhere beautiful [Music] even if you got a super busy lifestyle it doesn't mean missing out on delicious desserts they just have to be simple to make when it comes to cooking at home puddings should always be a pleasure and never a chore and homemade puds are 100 guaranteed to impress my next recipe has only two main ingredients but simplicity doesn't mean food can't taste out of this world incredible griddle pineapple with spiced caramel if you're making a dessert for one or two it's gonna be quick and easy this sumptuous delicious griddle pineapple fits the bill perfectly pineapple way of testing it's nice and ripe the top of the leaves come out perfect ready to go always cut a pineapple with a serrated edge knife slice off the bottom turn it back over and slice the top part now keep that for later look at the core the center of the pineapple and slice down directly in half slice that in half take each quarter and slice them smells incredible lay down flat and just slice that core off so you've got this perfect sort of boat of pineapple slice underneath but stop as you get right at the end slicing around the skin will make the pineapple easier to eat but leaving it attached gives you more control as it cooks next heat a griddle pan as hot as you can start off in the corner and push it down so you really mark the pineapple two minutes on each side and then just turn them really nice color now look at that beautiful i'm gonna sprinkle them with a little touch of sugar that's going to glaze them now slice the top take out these beautiful glazed slices of pineapple next up the spiced caramel now start off with your pan nice and hot sprinkle four tablespoons of sugar in there just flatten it then add the seeds from a fresh vanilla pod in a small dusting of chinese fly spice never stir caramel let it sort of bubble and transform here she goes now i've got the color i want it that's the perfect color off with the gas in with the butter and then a couple of tablespoons of cream lovely and then give that a little whisk add the rest of your cream nice and just drip that spicy caramel over your pineapple [Music] wow simple elegant and seriously impressive griddle pineapple with spiced caramel a delicious treat all to yourself that tastes even better shared

Gordon Ramsay's Ultimate Fit...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, there's a wealth of classic fast food dishes we know and love from hot dogs and kebabs to tacos and burgers but the great thing about making them at home is you can throw away the rule book and get creative my next easy recipe is a miniature version of an american favorite the burger smoky pork sliders with barbecue sauce everyone loves a burger they're a true fast food original and that's the exciting thing about street food you can take an old classic like that and reinvent it into something really exciting when you think of a burger what you need is a great sauce and a light smoky barbecue goes hand in glove with a great burger start by finely chopping one onion and three cloves of garlic nice hot pan tablespoon of olive oil onions and garlic into the pan nice seasoning salt and pepper now the secret of a good barbecue sauce is that really important caramelization to begin with a nice tablespoon of brown sugar it darkens the onions but it really starts to sort of give that nice syrupy body to the sauce and put a little bit of heat in there now a nice teaspoon of smoked paprika that's the important part of working with spices i've got to cook them out and almost sort of burn off that rawness especially with a smoked paprika that's exactly where i want it to go onions and garlic beautifully caramelized cider vinegar in reduce that down now i've got a fantastic smoky base to complete the sauce i'm making my life really easy and adding pre-made worcester sauce and tomato ketchup cook that out for two to three minutes now depending on how thick you like the barbecue sauce that determines how long you cook it out for i don't want it to be too runny but i don't want it too thick either that's the consistency we're looking for lovely turn down the gas charger seasoning now take that out it's the kind of sauce that i like to have sort of bottled up in the fridge it's great for sandwiches but goes brilliantly well with these sliders homemade smoky barbecue sauce [Music] give the pan a little wipe now start the mix for the sliders to give my mix a really interesting flavor and texture i'm gonna be using unsmoked back bacon i travel all over the world and i spend a lot of time in the states they know how to make a great slider pork sliders beef sliders chicken sliders and it's almost like a way of having a burger but on a much smaller miniature level a little teaspoon of olive oil i want that bacon to get really nice and crispy bacon in this just gives the really nice sort of chunky delicious mix i want texture and pork is perfect for a slider [Music] and choppy shallot slots are a lot sweeter than your normal white onion fine fine fine and in [Music] now that bacon's getting really nice and crispy i want a bit of heat in there a little teaspoon of smoked paprika in there when you see these sliders in the states for one portion there's like four or five of them little mini one biters incredible now take your pork just open it up and give that a really nice seasoning so important you can't season a slider after you've cooked it it's impossible so season it nicely bacon now that's nice and crispy just take a little touch kitchen roll and just drain that off there nice pat that nice and dry i want all that nice sort of crispiness in there beautiful mix all that in take a nice ball and sort of roll it the size of a golf ball get it nice and round first and then three fingers just pat that down don't flatten them too thin otherwise they overcook and they go sort of dry because sliders are bite-sized burgers designed to go in small buns you don't want to make them too big good get the pan nice and hot a tablespoon of olive oil when a slider is literally that thick about an inch thick we're going to take two and a half to three minutes to each side in turn them over lovely once you've turned them tilt the pan and just spoon all that juice back into them keep my mouth watering now very easy to dry the pork out so just feeling it now your fingers is nice and firm it's a little touch of springiness in the center i'm happy with those add your cheese now so it gets nicely melted i'm using wedges of smoked cheddar and it has that nice sort of soury smoky creaminess to the slider finally shredded baby gem lettuce just take those buns make sure they're sliced nice and evenly take your lettuce be quite generous when the lettuce it's a nice thin slice of tomato take your burgers you see that cheese you feed melted your bbq sauce place the top on and that is my version the slider that is small dynamic but packed full of flavor i'll take that over a hamburger any day here are three effortless recipes that are ready literally in minutes first up noodle soup with poached egg and spring onions [Music] add miso paste to boiling water japanese miso has a wonderful deep savoury richness and is brilliant in soups grating fresh

#GordonRamsay #Cooking #Food #Apples 

Gordon Ramsay's Ultimate Fit Food/Healthy, Lean...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, [Music] apples were my favorite fruit growing up originally came from china but today in britain we grow over 2 000 different types [Music] the most popular eating apples in the uk are braven and gala but don't miss out on some of the older types like the sweet nutty russets and fragrant coxes when it comes to cooking apples it's got to be a sharp brambly which i'm using as part of my compot for lunch now for the apple compote what we need to do first is to get these peeled and sliced i get my pan on to get nice and hot now let me give you a little taste of that they're incredibly acidic okay and you need to cook them those wonderful red apples you've got are called bray burns what other apples do you know green ones what they called um i'm not too sure what the green one is another word for your nan grandmas no red no pink lady apple no granny smith granny smith apples that's right what we're gonna do is cook the cooking apples and the eating apples together i love the combination of the tartness from the brambly cooking apple with the sweetness of the braeburn get the pan nice and hot and sprinkle the bottom of the pan with caster sugar three or four nice slices of fresh ginger and three little cinnamon sticks i want you to remember that because we're gonna look for them okay because once we've used them and they've worked their magic i need to pull them out see all the sugar dissolving definitely now we just let that go a little bit darker okay and then the place is quick doesn't it give that a nice little toss okay nice golden color cinnamon in ginger in so we're cooking down the apples butter in gently cook until the apples soften then take off the heat and they go into there what's that coming out dad so that is a little bit of the puree i'll show we'll do that in a minute how many ginger four four ginger and three cinnamon three cinnamon out with a cinnamon we've got another ginger gingers and we take a spoon of apples it smells so nice how nice is that look see the coloury apples let's put these in the fridge to get nice and cold that's the compost sorted easy now a simple creamy whip to crown the top do you separate the egg whites into there for daddy all right egg whites are in egg whites are separated and i'll sprinkle the sugar in and then you turn up the speed [Applause] good girl [Music] now let's see if you've got a really nice stiff peak so you lift them up now that is what i call a nice stiff peak well done not bad not bad next in a separate bowl whip double cream until stiff nice and slowly so cream whips so much quicker yeah nice that by hand we're gonna put some delicious lemon zest which will make the cream so much better then sweeten it up with leftover caramely compot puree you mix that in nice and carefully so it's like this apple butterscotch now to make the cream even lighter fold in those whisked egg whites and sugar egg whites into the cream just nicely fold that in so you bring your glasses back out manage the glasses yep good girl silly we're on for a treat open up the piping bag now twist the end now you could spoon this in but i want to just give a nice little lift it also gives it a nice pattern lemon on top back in the fridge irresistible cinnamon eggy bread with quick stewed apples i've never forgotten i think it was about six years of age when mum brought this huge tray of eggy bread to the table and it was like wow man we've died and gone to heaven start off with a slightly stale bread four or five day old loaf left over if it's a fresh bread then it absorbs too much of the egg so therefore it gets soggy you never get it fried and crisp and if you're not gonna use the breadcrumbs eggy bread is a must in france they call it pan perdu the lost loaf now eggy bread is great on its own but serving it with stewed apples is delicious so the secret here keeping the skins on it's a lot of flavor in the skin and also it stops the apple from breaking down too quickly they get these nice chunks as opposed to a sort of apple puree [Music] now get your pan nice and hot and sprinkle a couple of tablespoons of sugar take the sugar down to a light caramel it's quite incredible how cheap it is to make this and yet it was so filling if you haven't got apples this recipe will work pretty much with any fruit you've got in don't be scared to mix a pear and an apple a banana and a pineapple just chew it lightly toss in the caramel get a little knot of butter that makes a nice toffee apple flavor really simple now you can see what's happening the apples are caramelizing but they're staying intact because the skins on the apple and the caramel's turned into this nice rich butterscotch sauce once you've glazed all the apples a couple of tablespoons of water in there bring that bowl and let that cook out now the eggs three whole eggs whisk up the eggs add about four tablespoons of milk you want the egg thick and rich and then lightly sprinkle in a couple of tablespoons of sugar that sweetens up the mixture and when you start frying the bread it caramelizes it beautifully a teaspoon of powdered cinnamon that gives the bread that really nice spicy deliciousness apples are glazing beautifully and put them on a low heat and get a pan on now for the bread a teaspoon of oil that stops the butter from burning butter in as that starts frothing get your bread in it's going to be pretty quick now now you don't leave the bread soak in drain and in the pan once your egg bread has browned flip it over 90 seconds each side that butter gives that nice golden brown color of that egg [Music] beautiful absolutely beautiful it's quite remarkable isn't it a couple of eggs splash of milk leftover apples and all of a sudden you've got this stunning breakfast [Music] now my apples they've all glazed beautifully get a nice spoon of that amazing juice and drizzle that over mmm wow if my mum saw me doing this she'd kill me you're getting all posh again no no i'm using a touch of iced sugar to make him look stunning that for me takes me back to when i was six years of age and i thought i just won the lottery that is incredible thank you brett you won't get more breakfast for your buck my mum's incredibly delicious cinnamon eggy bread with quick stewed apples you

and just let that simmer now five or six minutes now for my potato cakes they're a fantastic way to use leftover boiled potatoes and are so easy to make i'm making a simple potato dough by adding flour and butter to the mash that gives it that nice sort of cakey texture and it goes from this leftover ball potato to this nice light flowery potato heaven take a nice spoon of potato lightly flour your board we're gonna fry these crisp on the outside and just nice and fluffy in the center now get your pan nice and hot we'll start off with olive oil into the pan now put the butter around the outside because it starts heating up by the time it goes into the center it's always sort of nut brown gently turn them over love that nice light crisp they look beautiful now take them out oh potato cake in the middle and a nice beautiful spoon of beans growing up with beans on toast as a treat still to this day after all those years has not changed my love or attitude for beans especially cooked like that my smoky spicy homemade baked beans with light and creamy potato cakes comfort and satisfaction on a plate [Music] when i was growing up food in britain was somewhat different to what it is now no one had heard of organic you couldn't even buy avocados in the shops where i lived paris kitchens might have been cooking nouvelle cuisine but it certainly hadn't made any inroads around our way malta my lunch when i was growing up was very plain pretty trashy but i still love it now and again fish fingers with a delicious chip butty secret of a good chip butty is in the potato now these are desiree potatoes one of my first ever jobs was working in a chip shop i used to put sacks and sacks of potatoes into the rumbler which will send the potato peeler all day long today i'm gonna do something a bit healthier for my oven chips with a twist simply peel slice and blanch for three to four minutes drain season and cover well with papika spread evenly over an oiled baking tray and place into a preheated oven for 20 minutes simple as that next up easy fish fingers this is pollock a really nice firm delicious fish got the fish in finger size batons of fish put them onto your plate and just lightly salt them you can do that literally 20 minutes 30 minutes before you start cooking the fish it firms the fish up beautifully and it allows it to become a little more durable especially in the pan now for the coating start by thoroughly coating the fish in seasoned flour and then just roll it to get rid of those little sharp corners because then it stops those corners almost burning in the pan in to your egg wash and really coat them wonderful and then this is dill goes brilliantly well with a fish and run the dill through my breadcrumbs that makes it more aromatic lay them onto your breadcrumbs nothing wrong with the chip butty nothing wrong with fish fingers just give it a lovely modern twist beautiful once the fish fingers are thoroughly coated they're ready to pan fry and they'll need around three minutes on each side i want the fish fingers to be nice and crispy get a really nice color on them first and then we'll flip them over and finish them with butter bring the heat up into the pan and a nice little knob of butter that'll work wonders with the breadcrumbs and the dill nice and carefully take them out they look and smell incredible stay nice and crispy now to assemble my chip butty starting with buttered thick crusty bread your slice of bread mop up that amazing flavor on slice in half never slice in an angle my mouth is salivating beautiful on with the ship butty there's one thing missing and it signifies that i've never forgotten the joy i've come for food but my god that makes me feel like a nine year old excuse me for a moment we want to stuff my face homemade fish fingers and my ultimate chip buddy so simple to make but trust me it tastes amazing a dish becomes a classic because it's delicious and somehow strikes are called with us it just works sometimes these dishes can become tired but a clever twist helps make them fresh again you can't get more classic than a centuries-old midday meal of bread cheese and beer reinvented and marketed by pubs as a plan was launched in the 60s i'm now giving it my 21st century take like plummets with the most amazing but super simple beer baked bread hearty and full of flavor for a really quick and easy bread dough sieve a mix of wholemeal and self-raising white flour with a good pinch of salt salt is really important the bread it's the first thing i do once i've cracked it and smelt you want to smell that salt baked throughout beer in about 250 mils of beer [Music] the reason why this recipe works so well is it the beer it's got that yeast so naturally it's gonna work beautifully give that a really good mix i'm looking for the mixture to be quite wet if the dough becomes too firm then it's going to cook dry in the center just as it starts to fall through the whisk that is perfect beautiful this mix will work really well as one large loaf but i want to make my plan ones a little bit more special small tins give it that kind of intimacy and i quite like having my own little loaf give the molds a really nice lining with butter make sure you butter the top now tablespoon of flour dust inside the mold that will stop your mixture sticking tap out any excess three quarters fill your little molds we're going to allow it to sort of rise just so it comes above the mold and forms this really nice miniature loaf onto the tray centimeter apart into the oven 25 to 30 minutes at 180. something quite nice about the smell of home baked bread in the kitchen delicious no plan was it's complete without pickled onions red onion is a lot sweeter less harsh than a white onion the early days of plum ones you've got those ghastly sharp pickled onions that make you almost cry when you're crunching them i'm gonna lightly pickle my red onion just push your fingers through so you get these nice sort of onion rings a little touch of salt a little sprinkle of sugar and then a couple of cloves in there that gives it a really nice sort of perfume and sort of makes the pickling slightly more mellow red wine vinegar now if you haven't got red wine vinegar white wine vinegar it's just as good but red matches the red onion so it goes hand in glove a couple of tablespoons of vinegar just give that a really good mix to speed up the pickling process use a weight to put pressure on the onions as the weight presses down on the onions the clove the salt the sugar the vinegar work their magic and it comes out with a really nice light fragrant pickle for my 21st century ploughmans i'm creating an all-in-one salad and bringing the traditional elements together with a punchy dressing a tablespoon of english mustard a tablespoon of honey a touch of salt and pepper and finish off with white wine vinegar and olive oil [Music] now generally it's sort of three parts oil to one part vinegar that's the sort of general base [Music] you don't really think of a vinaigrette with a plan ones but this is a really nice sort of modern approach to ploughmans for my plan salad i'm using a mixture of robust and crunchy romaine lettuce and punchy watercress if i was making a watercress soup i'd use the stalks but the stalks are a little bit bitter so i just grabbed them like that pinch them and then twist very peppery very hot but so juicy watercress in your celery chop it nice and finely it's the one thing that everybody leaves is that stick of celery so scatter it amongst the salad a bit of oomph and color from some sliced radishes and sweetness from a thinly sliced apple whilst you're busy throwing your plum and salad together do not forget about your beer bread before it comes out i'm gonna glaze the top with a little touch of milk that'll put a really nice finish to the bread back in for the last five minutes now for the magic in the plan ones generally you'll see it as a ham or cheddar or stilton flourman's it's hard to dictate which one's the best so for the ultimate plowmans i'm adding all three brilliant cheddar peel some nice shards of that delicious creamy cheddar just get them dancing on top the dressing drizzle ran in circles and then finally our delicious lightly pickled onions give them a good squeeze and look just dot the onions around bread it's ready it's got that nice yeasty smell warm crusty and delicious there you go that is my classic modern version of a traditional stunning player lens wow my delicious all-in-one plan one salad with individual beer bread loaves updated for the 21st century you

Gordon...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, [Music] breakfast lunch and dinner whether it's at my restaurants or at home i think food should always stand up and be noticed it doesn't matter if a dish is light and delicate or full-on and gutsy the flavors should be distinct and clear and that means always getting the maximum taste from your ingredients today it's all about vibrant muscular food so fasting your seatbelt for my ultimate breakfast lunch and dinner packed with big and bold flavors first up a punchy breakfast of murgues and fontina stuffed croissants flavor there is incredible for lunch a spicy mexican soup be adventurous but beware serve with quick tortilla chips and a peek of the guy or dip maggie for dinner i'll be setting the world to write with my eldest megan you're so annoying i'm so annoyed when we make one of her favorite dishes crispy roast duck with pancakes and black bean dipping sauce seen as is your favorite that you can make it followed by a spiced banana tart to tan wow these are my ultimate recipes for a day bursting with their big and bold breakfast lunch and dinner starting with a breakfast that can't fail to wake you up merguez and fontina stuffed croissants okay big and bold i was living in france i stayed there for three years once twice a week i treated myself to the most amazing bold breakfast and it started off with these beauties here murgays cheap but incredibly tasty start off with a nice hot pan murgay's in it's a very spicy sausage doesn't need any help doesn't even need chili just a touch of salt and pepper you can smell the spice they're starting to release all that wonderful oil that flavor in there add a couple of cloves i'll finely slice garlic spread the garlic across the pan it instantly changes color takes on this nice dark rich golden color now take a look with the heat out with the parsley the stalks of soft herbs like parsley and coriander can be used to impart flavor during cooking but the leaves should always be added just before serving to give maximum colour and fragrance [Music] and then finish that off with my capers amazing all right beautiful now take your quests on they're literally 24 hours old so they're crispy on the outside and just slice off the lid this recipe is a great way to use up any leftover croissants from the day before i used to cringe when i saw the french cooks throw away croissants i used to cry thinking oh my god any idea what you're throwing away in terms of flavor whatever you do do not wipe out that pan dunk your croissants mopping up all that amazing flavor and caramelizing the inside for that beautiful and don't forget the lids and then get your thumbs and go inside the croissant all i want to do now is just create a little pocket and just manipulate the crescent now this is where it gets exciting mix up the capers the garlic and sausages look at the color of that wonderful delicious flavoured oil now some cheese but not just any cheese fontina cheese is like the number one cheese for grilling and because it's a very rich cheese you shave it thinner than you would a white truffle but it gives a really nice saltiness and a light smokey flavour a touch of pepper salt place these big boys on the tray literally 30 seconds on the grill here we go nice crisp packed full of flavor now top them and that for me it's almost like being back in paris except this time i don't have to share them with the french my ultimate big and bold breakfast murgays and fontina stuffed croissants a great way to start the day [Music] never be scared of trying new flavors in your cooking a few key ingredients can make all the difference here's a closer look at some i'll be using later peppercorns may be small but whatever the color in terms of flavor they're one of the heavy weights of the kitchen with the exception of the pink type all peppercorns are fruits from the same flowering vine it's the stage at which they are harvested and how they are processed that determines their unique colors and tastes [Music] today i'll be using the fiery black and perfume pink types to add a big bold punch to my pudding [Music] for dinner i'll be cooking duck hugely popular in chinese cuisine this bird may be less meaty than a chicken but its intense rich flavor means the meat goes a long long way [Music] wild or farmed duck meat is packed with protein vitamins and essential nutrients and i'm going to slow roast one in my dinner dish of crispy roast duck with pancakes chilis are a fabulous ingredient and one of my absolute favorites is the chipotle chipotles begin life as a green jalapeno pepper the process of drying and smoking lends an intense smoky flavor to balance their spicy heat dried chipotles can be brought as a paste powder or whole which is how i'll be using them in my big bold lunch chilies come in all shapes and sizes and heat and are used throughout the world but if there's one cuisine that has really turned cooking them into an art form it's mexican they're experts at building layer upon layer flavored with delicious chilies and spices so for my ultimate big and bold lunch spicy mexican soup it's hearty delicious robust but served with some tortillas and a wonderful salsa it's almost like a complete meal in one starting with some finely chopped red onions for my soup let's get some heat going early these are chipotle so they're smoky rich they don't come with any warning signal and these are seriously hot so be adventurous but beware a nice teaspoon of toasted cumin oregano dried now start frying off spices the heat you'll see the chilies start swelling up delicious garlic be quite generous on the oil because that helps to blow out the chili right now those onions and garlic are on fire we're going to balance the sort of heat from the chipotle with sugar turn up the heat and really start caramelizing that sugar and the chili gives off the most amazing aroma next fry up a tablespoon of tomato puree add a can of chopped tomatoes cook kidney beans and vegetable or chicken stock to cover there's something quite exciting about big and bold flavors because in the restaurants you have to be somewhat controlled you can't go crazy so cooking these kind of dishes at home gives me that kind of release chilis particularly when they're dried continue to swell and release their heat as they're cooked so the longer you cook your dish the hotter it will be [Music] but it's not as powerful it needs to be yet and every five six seven eight minutes that's gonna get stronger hotter and more delicious bring that up to the ball and cook that out for 15 minutes whilst i allow the chili heat to infuse i'm going to crack on with quick crunchy tortilla chips and a fabulously fresh and spicy tomato salsa known in mexico as pico de gallo start by finely dicing three ripe tomatoes one or two deseeded fresh jalapeno peppers and half a red onion then chop a good handful of fresh coriander add the juice from two limes salt and pepper and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil for the tortilla chips rub a little olive oil onto six large shop bought wheat wraps sprinkle with smoked paprika and gently massage in cut each wrap into triangles and spread them onto a baking tray bake for three to four minutes in a preheated oven 180 degrees until golden brown and leave to cool to complete my mexican lunch i need to finish my deliciously fragrant spicy soup the spice is there it is absolutely spot on now for the cooling down process the mexicans are brilliant at building layer upon layer of flavor with delicious chilies and spices but they're also experts at tempering their dishes with cooling ingredients like avocado sour cream and cheese that's why you can take that amount of chili you don't have a spoon of richness spice and all of a sudden avocados almost like a little fire blanket over those chillies to further counter the chilli heat mexicans use a rich tangy crumbly cheese but i'm sprinkling on lancashire which is a great british substitute and last but not least cooling fresh coriander one delicious spicy mexican soup serve that with your tortilla chips and your pico de gallo salsa a phenomenal blend of textures and layers and spice and creaminess big bold and delicious one of the secrets to making fantastic food at home is learning to be confident when you're using strong flavors all dishes need to be balanced but don't be afraid of using herbs and spices to make your cooking vibrant and exciting here's my ultimate big and bold dinner a meal that demands to be taken notice of [Music] and helping me in the kitchen is my eldest daughter megan crispy roasted up with pancakes with the addy kick of a black bean dipping sauce megan gonna help with the duck danny your favorite yes it is now how's your boyfriend right i'm going come on that woke you up didn't it so what do you love most about duck the dipping sauce the dipping sauce i love that uh let's get the duck in the oven first let's get a bit of salt in there please then some pepper thank you some spring onion garlic and ginger now why do you think we pour that in there to season it and flavor it how come you put them in hole like that and not smaller it's going inside i'm not using it for sauce or anything so it's just going to make it really nice what are they star anise sorry so what happens as the duck roasts on the outside it creates this really nice perfume aroma inside tuck that in there to get it spicy rub all that chinese five spice yeah over almost like you're massaging good so make sure you get it all in even the little wings you know underneath her just like i used to do to you my bath i used to wash your little handys i know those days are long gone i know i know i know dad that is seriously spicy with the duck there's generally quite a lot of fat there yeah so we're gonna put it on this little bench okay and that goes there by slowly roasting it okay it's gonna get nice and crisp on the outside all that fat is gonna render inside the breast so therefore it's gonna get all nice and juicy yeah right ducks in three and a half hours at 160 degrees celsius your favorite part you said was the dipping sauce why is it your favorite part i think it really adds to the dark it makes it really tasty cena's is your favorite you can make it i'm gonna do nothing okay daddy's gonna put his feet up so uh first off the garlic there's one good girl watch your fingers please always do good nice oh you're fast huh watch your fingers i am watch your fingers slide slow down please 14. all right that's enough right little teaspoon of olive oil in a few years time i'll be teaching how to drive as well as cook how exciting is that you know in a car scary okay garlickin crispy duck is traditionally served with hoisin sauce but my brood love the additional big bold punch of black beans nice megan and i add soy sauce and lastly for that classic chinese sweet and sour element brown rice vinegar and honey [Music] are you happy with the flavour i'm really happy can you taste everything in there dipping sauce done ducks in the oven let's start the dessert the most amazing tata tan are those pink peppercorns they are pink peppercorns they're really good they don't taste anything like black peppercorns quite sweet aren't they they're really sweet very fruity the pink peppercorns give it the sweetness the black peppercorns give the heat now what is that baby vanilla this is one of the easiest desserts in the world to make but one of the most delicious it's a sort of take on the classic apple or pear to tan but when you caramelize those bananas with the peppercorns and the vanilla i bet that tastes amazing oh my goodness incredible okay i'm gonna make the camera start off with the cold pen first and you just press that button in there how come do you do it like that and not let it just melt naturally because i want the butter to stay cold because i'm gonna stick the bananas in there okay and then we'll make the caramel and caramelize the bananas at the same time so in goes those vanilla vanilla seeds pods in there as well okay peppercorns done yeah well done good girl sprinkle them over that butter just naturally naturally yeah nice and then look just very carefully sprinkle sugar over that you're doing them all the same size roughly the same size wedge it into the butter well do you know what want the bananas really caramelized you just stuck them between if you crown them in like this okay it will stop them moving around nothing's moving nothing is okay it's all wedged in there spreading the peppercorns on top of the bananas so you can feel that flavor in the caramel and on the top and the bottom right puff pastry puff pastry is difficult and time consuming to make so i always buy ready-made when i'm at home to get the best flavor and texture go for the all butter type and keep your pastry cold before using it this is where it gets really exciting you get your fingers you just pinch the end so you thin the end if you do that for me very carefully you have to be quick because the heat your fingers can melt the pastry how comes you do it dad because we get it nice and thin so we can clip it underneath now take a spoon and what we do is lift up that banana and tuck it underneath see little parcel like a parcel and see the thin bits of pastry yeah how easy it is to get it underneath yeah and that's why you thin them out you do it so quickly well because i have to be quick otherwise the pastry will melt notice how we're not using anything sharp so we're not would that cut the pastry that's right see how locked down that is [Music] gas on we'll start caramelizing her those three little holes are so important if we didn't put a hole in the pastry and it will cause a lot of steam so the pastry never cooks it just goes really soggy okay so really important the caramel is live now we're working the camel give a little shake how can you see the caramel through the pastry look what happens when it tilts oh yeah see all comes running down see yeah i see now that pastry okay it's like clinging on to the bananas and so when we turn it upside down we've got this glove full of these caramelized bananas look at that wow it looks like look a locky looking lucky ah look at likey got it now baby you're very annoying i'm sorry it's your birthday soon 15. i've just worked it out i'm my 50th you're 18. perfect we should do a joint party yeah love it twelve two four for the old ones twelve lunches have time till four for the old one so they can go to sleep megan we'll go on later come on perfect here's where i get excited now look at the color of that caramel so tilt the pan again see how dark it is now yeah wow it's going a lot darker now it didn't take long didn't take long at all that's nearly ready for the oven but before i put that in i'll get the duck out wow how's the duck doing crispy wow and delicious how crispy that is it's really crispy that's what happens when it slow cooks so 20 minutes for the duck to rest and 20 minutes in the oven 190 to 200 degrees for our banana tartar tan time to knock up a quick hoisin and cucumber salad to put in our crispy duck pancakes for the dressing combine hoisin sauce rice wine vinegar soy sauce a dash of sesame oil and to give it that zingy asian punch some freshly grated root ginger [Music] for the salad trim and cut spring onions into very fine matchsticks peel a whole cucumber into long thin ribbons and shred in a couple of baby gem lettuces season and toss this fresh crunchy salad in the sweet yummy hoisin dressing a combination that never fails to get the kids eating their greens wow look at that so see now where that pastry is caramelizing caramel so dark and just a little tip gas back on and that will release it because if you tip it and it's still sticking then some of your bananas will stick yeah so now see when it starts spinning around like this moving around and here we are the moment of truth when you know your daddy is the best chef in the world ready yep wow the vanilla how delicious is really good as well right start to stand out done crispy dipping sauce cucumber salad ready so if you take them and your dipping sauce take them over thank you i'll take the duck don't drop it promise oh okay it was amazing my ultimate big and bold dinner of crispy roast duck with pancakes with a hoisin dressed salad and some extra oomph from megan's favorite black bean dipping sauce nice ollie i think you need a bit more duck in there you heard me home honestly it's like a black burrito and for a big and bold pudding delicious spiced banana tartar tan jack's gonna be so hot can i have a little bit of me i think we might have to save him some swimming makes him very hungry that's saving the wishbone of the duck that's me [Music] there are loads more

#GordonRamsay #Cooking...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, [Music] some of the best food i had in india was street food and every little food stall was cooking up something spicy something delicious little teaspoon of oil gonna toast off a teaspoon of cumin mustard seeds a touch of salt and pepper lightly fry them off it's really important to cook off the spices it intensifies the flavor but really draws out that nice spicy deep rich flavor so onion three fingers one in front two behind nice and fine onions in now we're going to caramelize those onions mustard seeds have started to infuse cumin has that nice kick now with a little touch of butter in there get it nice and sort of rich gas up nice and high and really caramelise those onions now once the onions have turned a rich golden color that's what i'm looking for that is beautiful add baby spinach keep that pan nice and hot if you don't cook it out the actual breakfast ends up watering when the spinach is cooked set aside and it's on to the spicy eggs now the breakfast really starts to come alight four nice eggs now give those eggs a little whisk a little touch of butter into the pan a little teaspoon of oil so the butter doesn't burn when the butter and oil are hot add a teaspoon of garam masala and turmeric cook that out now take your eggs into the pan almost gonna make like a really nice spicy scrambled egg turn the gas down now as the scrambled egg comes together just finish that with a little bit of butter i quite like the sort of creaminess makes it so much more delicious and then from there i get my spinach chop up and then fold in the spinach to your scrambled egg something quite exciting about eating spice for breakfast but it's served in these wonderful little thin naan breads this will work with any flatbread or wrap you fancy and then lightly toast your naan take the eggs off the heat whilst you get on with the last job add quick mint and spice yogurt dressing a couple of tablespoons of fresh yogurt in there's always something to take out the heat then add chopped mint salt and turmeric mix that in now take a scrambled egg and half fill and now it smells incredible get your yogurt down on top and lift that over and for me that's what really stands out with street food in india how delicious they can make street food with a little bit of spice amazing [Music] once you try this spicy wrap i promise you scrambled eggs will never taste the same in order to make sure that the batter stays nice and crispy and the fish stays nice and firm the secret is to season the fish salt and pepper that will draw out the moisture and that will keep the fish really nice and firm put it in the fridge for around 10 minutes to let the seasoning work its magic now the batter as always when making any batter always sieve the flour i want a bit of heat in the batter so a nice teaspoon of cayenne pepper season the flour salt and pepper and then two teaspoons of baking powder this almost lightens the load of the batter now ginger beer it gives that batter this sort of unique spicy individual flavor it's delicious with a fish and a nice tablespoon of oil just basic vegetable oil gives it a nice sheen give that a good mix you really want it almost like the consistency of double cream too thin and the batter runs off especially when it hits the fryer too thick and it actually prevents the fish from getting cooked so you've got to get it to that just that sort of double cream texture let it rest for as long as possible to give you an even textured batter now the season should have worked its magic and drawn out the excess moisture from the fish so it's on to the next stage fish has gone slightly firmer perfect for frying start by coating the fish in flour seasoned with pepper pat that nice and dry into your hands so you haven't got any excess flour the flour stops the batter from running off the fish i'm just gonna check to see if my oil's ready by putting a little touch of batter into the fryer you see it bubbling straight to the very top that tells you that the oil is ready never really ever fill the pan above halfway if the oil starts to get too hot first thing you do turn off the gas second thing add some oil into it to cool it down hold the fish by the corner unless you put it in and roll it round then gently slap the fish on the sides of the bowl to get rid of excess batter now in and lay away and just gently drop it in twist your pan that stops it from sticking at the bottom oil should be gently sort of bubbling away but notice as we're frying the fish there's no spitting of any water from the fish fry the fish for three to five minutes gently turning halfway through once the batter is golden and crisp it's ready look they look stunning it's like these big crispy pillows of beautifully textured cart leave the fish to rest on a kitchen towel to blot excess oil meanwhile it's quick and easy chilly minted mushy peas now how much you peas a little teaspoon of olive oil and a nice knob of butter into the pan shallot finely chopped that adds a bit of sweetness to the peas slots into the pan chili these are delicious when you eat peas and they're slightly spicy they're even better garlic in the peas sweat off the chilli the garlic and the slots before the peas join those spices simply blanch in salted boiling water infuse with their perfect partner fresh mint stalks and all and then put your frozen peas in now what's the peas i've got nice and soft drain them now take off the stalks and then add your peas to the shallots i love that sound mix all that chili and garlic in there a little seasoning finishing the frozen peas off like this absolutely delicious onto your board crush now you cannot beat crushed delicious peas those peas is incredible top with chopped mint chilli minted mushy peas so simple and perfect with easy ginger beer battered fish a nice spicy crispy batter and that just reaffirms the importance of comfort food if you're gonna do it do it properly [Music] oh my spicy twist is proof you can update a comforting classic and the best way to eat this is with crispy buttered sauteed potatoes cooked with garlic rosemary and thyme to take this happy food to a whole new [Music] level

couple of tablespoons of oil the marinade in how nice little taste not your finger jack that's really good right wings in get your hands in there and start rubbing in the marinade please okay so the secret now is to coat the chicken wings and all that marinade yeah yeah how long do you leave them in here do you know what the longer the better cover that with limp film wash your hands excellent good job ideally marinate your wings overnight but half an hour will be enough to get the flavors going [Applause] right so they've marinated now if you take the tray out people bottom one thank you and then we're gonna put some tinfoil on there thank you so hold that in half it stops them from sticking and that'll stop the wings from burning so from there get them really dipped in that marinade and try and get the wing like that and just sort of scoop it look like that so get that really nice glaze on there and then just yeah so that garlic will roast and i got all those wings usually done i can make then ready for the oven 170 25 to 30 minutes yep good man excellent nice it's hot wings are in right to go with my ultimate southeast asian dinner rice cooked in homemade thai green curry paste for the easy green curry paste roughly chopped coriander lemongrass green chilies lime leaf shallots garlic and ginger a glug of oil and blitz the paste takes minutes to make but it'll keep for up to 10 days if covered with oil and stored in a sealed jar in the fridge to awaken the flavors lime roll to release the juice next season with salt and pepper and blend into a smooth paste heat the paste until aromatic add in cooled or leftover rice i love using fragrant jasmine rice but your standard long grain rice is great too thoroughly heated through serve thai green curry paste is so easy to make so with rice like this it's incredible but simply add to chicken fish or veg to create a fantastic meal in minutes right now for the green beans beans in uh bring the water to the ball what's the first thing i should put in there beans salt salt so nice pinch of salt in there yeah so make an amazing dressing two nine tablespoons yep of a crunchy peanut butter please why is it crunchy it'll give it texture and it'll be nice and sort of chunky green beans in okay got the rice green beans we're gonna blotch them for two two and a half minutes what does blanching actually mean blanching means sort of part cooking okay i'm gonna blanch them in boiling water yeah and then finish them in the pan use the back of the spoon a little bit easier a teaspoon of brown sugar and she goes nice is that a little bit too thick maybe yeah it is let's put a little touch more soy sauce in there let it down yeah yeah nice smell a little touch of vinegar nice i'm going to get a pan on now put my beans so a little taste did you taste it it's so good oh man hmm wow so if you got the garlic like that i'm going to slice the garlic down like this keep the knife nice and flat that way you'll slice through it but take your time don't worry about the speed and technique right first just cut it in half okay your fingers good and then lay the flat side down so it's nice and sturdy and that nail there it's not out like that it's just guiding the knife so you can never cut yourself like that good i'll drain the beans nice a little tablespoon of oil get the pan nice and hot i'm gonna throw the garlic good nice mmm so fine i smell that already is that lovely so give that a little toss so when you toss it push it down push away and pull back okay have a little go push it down and gently take your time nice so push down and pull back up that's it nice so it's getting nice and golden brown green beans are drained and they go in now to the garlic combination of green beans okay with the rice oh there's one of that oh wow i want you now to spoon the dressing release and she goes nice how delicious does that look wow what's daddy's policy at home no waste no waste no waste but now smell that now oh wow it doesn't smell like green beans it smells like what is this oh thanks how nice is that lovely amazing right that's the rice that's the green beans [Music] now i want you to sprinkle some toasted sesame seeds on top please nice and generous with a sesame seed i'll give the beans a little bit of a crunch now all that's left for your favorites to come out don't those beans smell amazing jack look at those beauties one for me one for you three for me one for you now i'd like you to sprinkle some spring onions on top please nice and generous you transformed a very cheap and cheerful chicken wing yeah all right let me take them over please do not drop them okay jack let's go nice this is my ultimate simple southeast asian dinner sticky spicy chicken wings thai green curry rice and fantastic beans with chili peanut dressing guaranteed to get the fussiest of eaters into greens that is the most amazing pork butt that's away butts away now this is incredible there's the shoulder yeah and look there's the shoulder blade if you go through here there's a knuckle there that's connecting the top and that's why it's called a butt the slower you cook it the more juicy it is and it's great for big parties because you just come along and get your fork and shred it a delicious smoky mayonnaise and you're away onions into half and half again okay i'm gonna leave the roots on okay because i want this to sit underneath the pork it gives it a chance to cook evenly it doesn't get dry in the bottom really important okay now i'll peel the garlic okay i'd like you and to crush the garlic we're gonna make a really nice little paste okay go on maggie no come on come on come on nice good girl one more crush come on maggie i'm coming sorry about that little cup there now this

really quick okay and sort of rub that mushroom in almost that's exactly that smells amazing honestly you just drizzle a little touch of olive oil on top of that for me i keep the pork nice and moist lovely like some of the best party dishes the marinading of the pork shoulder can be done days in advance so if i was doing this for a sunday and start marinating thursday friday so it gets even tastier right quite easy as well to make it's very easy five and a half to six hours in the oven at 140. while our pork butt slowly roasts meg and i are going to pimp some shop bought mayonnaise i don't like just plain mayonnaise there's so many things you have to twist yeah there's so many things some of the exciting things you can do with it right salt pepper and little touch of honey sweetness yeah sweetness but there's some heat coming okay and i've got a little bit off you love this chipotle smoked chipotle paste i love that once you've made this dressing you know it can sit in the fridge great for open sandwiches yeah can you use it for any sandwiches really any sandwiches but goes brilliantly well with pork now just have a little taste i've never had this before it's so good a nice spoon of mustard so that's our nice spicy mayonnaise after five and a half hours in the oven our pork is nearly ready just time to knock up a couple of tried and tested party favorites

finely chop spring onions and grate some nutty grilled cheese when the potatoes are cooked through drain roughly crush and add your spring onions and gherkins [Music] season to taste and gently combine before a final sprinkling of grated greer these simple cheesy crushed potatoes are equally delicious served hot or cold now i want something sort of raw like a slaw something quite refreshing yeah so i'm gonna make a really nice fresh broccoli salad now these are called florets that's the best part of the broccoli okay the bit that everybody wants once they're off i'm going to slice the broccoli okay you ever had raw broccoli before it's always been cooked really when you dress this with the dressing it's incredible now a little seasoning early on yeah okay now for the dressing fresh yogurt in teaspoon of sugar please daddy a little small cider vinegar mmm there you go finely chopped shallot in with the broccoli so pernicious roasted almonds into the broccoli currants i love them

Gordon Ramsay's Ultimate Fit Food/Healthy, Lean...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, whether i'm doing a simple sponge cake or make an elaborate tart i want my bacon to be the best it can be so i always start with the best ingredients i can find knowledge is crucial the more you know personally about where your ingredients are from and how they produce the better [Applause] [Music] flour to get the low down on one of the key ingredients to brilliant baking it always pays to ask an expert and if there's one man who can really rise to the occasion it's professional miller mark able doing a job like this means that you end up thinking and living a flower if that's obsession i'm obsessed [Music] at his mill which has stood in norfolk since 1835 mark uses traditional stones to grind his flower so he really knows his stuff [Music] what actually comes off the field is something like this still husked still needs to be processed before we can actually mill it we then clean down to something like this which is ready to be milled [Music] all this is a great big machine which means you don't have to do it by hand rather than try and improve its performance by adding additional chemicals what we're trying to do is mill it in the best way to get that performance from it [Music] if you can put a seed in between stones you can make flour out of it it's that simple barley was what was traditionally used to make braid for people to live off oats can be used as well and of course good old spelt the great grandmother of modern wheats which has the most fantastic flavor and is because of its primitive nature the proteins in it are simpler so a lot of people can eat that they can't eat modern weight keep your eyes on the shelves look and see what is there and if something strikes you as being potentially interesting then get it and try it mix your own blend your hand together so that you can get the flavor that you want with the performance that you want [Music] mark's right different flowers perform and taste wildly different and so they're well worth trying out here's my quick guide to some of the flowers i like using strong flour is the one to choose for standard bread making the higher the protein content the crust your loaf will be the flour hailing from italy double zero it's super finely milled and perfect for pasta i like to use it for pizzas too because it produces a nice crispy crust like the one on my mozzarella and rosemary version rye flour will give you really dense fruity flavored bread fruit cakes or scones if it's too heavy for you just mix it with standard wheat flour and when you are baking remember that self-raising flour is just plain flour with raisin asians added so if you run out you can add baking powder and salt to your plain flour and get baking that's the real stuff that's it fresh flour straight out the mill is so superior in flavor and performance that uh it's only when you come to use it you realise what the difference is if you're going to experiment with ingredients in bacon you still need to follow some basic rules to make sure things turn out brilliantly every time kicking off with my simple soda bread first up measure out your dry ingredients plain flour wholemeal flour salt sugar and bicarbonate of soda [Music] mix get 450 ml of buttermilk pour most of it in and combined buttermilk has a wonderful subtle sour note that gives this bread a deliciously different taste you can get it in most of the big supermarkets if your dough's a bit stiff add the rest of your buttermilk flour your board gently knead the mixture for about 30 seconds until it's all combined dust your baking tray place your dough in the center and score a deep cross with a knife to get a perfect crust then simply bake in a preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes amazingly easy absolutely delicious and foolproof hot crusty homemade soda bread whenever you want my next no sweat bread recipe is even faster to make quick flatbreads with lemon thyme and ricotta for the dough mix first slice a leek lengthwise and chop and saute in a pan with olive oil and butter till tender season next combine flour with a pinch of seasoning and olive oil and mix in your cooked leeks bring the dough together in a bowl with a drop of warm water cover and rest for 20 minutes allowing the dough mixture to relax means the resulting bread will be nice and soft then dust the dough with flour mold into a sausage shape slice it into rounds [Music] and flatten with a rolling pin then simply fry in a hot dry pan [Music] when golden and crisp on each side remove for a simple supper served with a cottage cheese lemon zest and fresh thyme so simple so fast and so versatile flatbreads to die for next how to make one of the world's most popular bread-based foods fast mozzarella and rosemary pizza [Music] for the pizza dough add yeast to warm water put in a tablespoon of sugar and leave to one side in a separate bowl add sieve flour make a well and add your olive oil and yeast mixture get your hands right in to bring it together then knead for about 10 minutes on a floured surface until even and smooth put back into the bowl cover and leave in a warm place to prove once it's roughly doubled in size knock any excess air out [Music] place back on your surface divide your dough into four balls and simply flatten add olive oil to a hot pan and put in the pizza dough pizza is usually cooked in a seriously hot oven but this pan cook method works brilliantly as the dough starts to bubble and the base turns golden spoon over tomato passata which is sift tomatoes and tear in chunks of mozzarella then simply transfer to a hot grill until golden and bubbly finished with fresh rosemary i love this classic combination but you can easily adapt it and add your own favorite topping for a perfect pizza in minutes so simple so fast so irresistible three recipes they'll change the way you think about homemade bread forever beautiful sponge with fresh ginger bacon is part chemistry part imagination but you've got to rely on the rules for great results the only time you'll see me reaching for the scales first off eggs sugar butter and when i say weigh out the ingredients it does literally mean way out to the final gram 175 now 175 grams of sugar that's 350 grams in total cream the butter and the sugar to get a delicious light sponge start carefully on slow speed only speed up as the butter and sugar really start to cream together keep that really nice and light you can see how it's changed color so important at the beginning eggs in give me a little whisk adding one egg at a time stops the mix from separating second egg in third one in that's what we're looking for a really nice sort of light airy 80 texture now i'm going to flavor the sponge a little teaspoon of vanilla extract that perfumes the mix one teaspoon of baking powder that gives lightness 175 grams of flour and we're going to sieve it a to get rid of any lumps and b to keep it really nice and fine 175. we're not gonna beat that out we're just gonna lightly fold that in now what i'm looking for is a really nice loose dough that's looking a little bit too firm so just a little splash of milk a couple of tablespoons that relaxes the mixture down helps create that nice almost dropping consistency that's what i want just starting to drop take a non-stick loose bottom cake tin greasy with butter then coat it with flour to avoid the sponge sticking just give that a little shake make sure you get all the rim now just get the back of the spatula make sure you've got no peaks on my sponge to make sure the sponge bakes nice and evenly tap the tin a few times to knock out any air pockets that might have formed in the mixture now into the oven bake for 30 to 35 minutes at 180 degrees as that's cooking prepare the ginger cream for the center 300ml of cream give that a nice whisk whisking the cream by hand gives you so much more control and it's so easy to over whipped cream i want that nice light ginger cream in the center i don't want it grainy nothing worse when cream starts to separate now let's get into that three-quarter stage a little stiff peaks stop that for two minutes fresh ginger now get a really nice large slice of ginger smells incredible it's so fragrant green ginger is like sort of peeling a potato just take out all those little dark spots now get your grater you haven't gotten grater you can chop the ginger really finely i've got almost like a puree of ginger going through but the juice as well take your knife and just scrape all that taste it's incredible it's fragrant and it's not sweet it's got a really nice taste set that in the fridge [Music] smells incredible run a knife around the outside to ensure the cake doesn't stick to the tin before turning it out now get your hands under push up and out while your cake cools i'm gonna do like a really nice sweet chocolate coating pour 300 mils of

If you...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, first up eggs bait in hash browns the secret of a great hash brown are the potatoes i prefer using really nice waxy potatoes they cook better but more importantly hold themselves together we're not gonna slice the onion all the potatoes but we're actually gonna grate them the potatoes get really nice and crispy i mean seriously crispy now the onion that way you get that nice balance of that onion flavor running through every little shard of potato [Music] season with salt pepper olive oil and km give that a really good mix through and then squeeze all that water out and look at all that juice we squeeze out there really important the more liquid you remove the crispier your hash browns will be nice large pan put that on once the pan's hot pour in a good glug of olive oil [Music] that sound confirms how important it is to have your pan nice and hot so it seals the grated potato onion together so take the spoon and just pat it down what we're trying to do now is get it really nice and compact going around the outside of the pan with little flecks of butter you just slip them down the back gently and that gets the onions caramelised here's a great tip for turning your hash browns over quick and easy take a plate place it on top and just flip it over and then slide it back in very quickly you see the color we've got on there now got that nice crispy texture of the potato i'm going to use the hash brown as a bed for my baked eggs crack in your eggs nice and gently just a little sprinkling of the cayenne to make the eggs a little bit spicy then into a preheated oven for six to eight minutes meanwhile onto my bacon and i'm giving it a classic american twist now one thing i could never get my head around when i first started eating lots of american breakfast was the sweetness from the bacon i've grown up to love that combination of smoky sweet flavors and it's so easy pan on and simply heat olive oil brown sugar salt and pepper and butter bacon in and as it cooks it becomes irresistibly caramelized and golden brown tofu gas and my glazed bacon absolutely ready beautiful now my hash browns and baked eggs are ready wow look at that beautiful just put your spatula underneath there onto your plate and that bacon sets beauty on top of the baked eggs and that hash brown underneath and you can see why the best breakfasts in the world are always in america [Music] this is an all-american superhero offer breakfast eggs baking hash browns with glazed bacon when it comes to cooking techniques barbecue is virtually a religion in america especially in the southern states down there the real barbecue pros use big open fire pits to get huge joints of meat super succulent and fantastically perfumed with smoke and spice so my ultimate american dinner has to include an amazing mouth in the mouth barbecue beef but i'm doing it the easy way cooked in the oven low and slow we're creating barbecue style beef brisket with crunchy coleslaw and sweet potato wedges which will be right up her street holly now you love barbecues right so you're gonna help me barbecue this delicious piece of brisket brisket look at it beautiful it's a very tough cut of meat so it needs to be cooked slowly so it gets really nice and tender are we barbecuing it outside we're gonna actually put the barbecue flavor on there but we're gonna cook it in the oven okay so mustard powder okay here we have some celery seed next a little bit of salt in there okay what's this here cumin two again nice good now this one cayenne pepper absolutely right right two teaspoons of that in there as well good now what i want you to do fresh pepper on there i'll give that a little mix roll up your little sleeves and then i want you to rub all that spice into the brisket almost like you're massaging it in there good girl come on holes get your hands nice and flat on there good girl now that's nice and coated okay in the spice so gas on roasting tray on what we've got to do now with all those spices is sear them in a couple of tablespoons of olive oil into the tray well done okay good that's getting nice and hot now and you get your brisket and all that spice lay that in there nicely okay so now we'll start coloring it as you start to sear in you smell those spices yep all that spice left on the plate we're gonna use yeah i want you to get the onions nice and carefully slice them down not too thin but just like you're chopping them take your time smell those spices now good girl thank you wash my hands i can rub my eyes damn holly was homework that bad no the onions oh no don't rub your eyes don't rub your eyes we've got the colour on the brisket okay yeah take that out literally for 30 seconds okay onions into the tray please nice you see it's starting to smell slightly barbecuey already give that a little stir nice now one nice tablespoon of brown sugar what does the brown sugar do dad so the brown sugar you're gonna start caramelizing the onions right from there my bay leaves in please good girl oh yes please right you want to take over good careful that tray is very very hot a tablespoon of tomato puree roast that off at the bottom of the tray to really rub it in amongst the onions good girl now look at the color of the onions right now time for a little drink for the brisket okay one bottle of earring please so you go in you put yours in there i'll put mine here good good health to you and your brisket good health bring that to the ball okay now this is where it gets really exciting i want you to lift the brisket up and put it on top of the onions in she goes good girl and then i want to pour the stock all the way around please i'm using beef stock but it will work with chicken stock or even vegetable stock once the stock has come to the boil cover tightly with foil and just pinch in the ends fat that down and then you just twist all the way so that's nice and tight that's the hard work done thank you simply pop it in the oven for three and a half hours and as it cooks you can get on with the side dishes first job sweet potato wedges with some serious flavor start by making a spice mix in a dry pan toast coriander seeds until beautifully aromatic then put them in a pestle and mortar add salt and grind [Music] next smoked paprika dried oregano cayenne pepper and mix spice mix done now simply cut your sweet potatoes into wedges toss in olive oil and thoroughly cover with the spice mix onto a baking tray and into a preheated oven for 30 minutes turning halfway irresistible sweet potato wedgies are ready now to finish off my beef see that smell just sort of travels everywhere oh ah now look at that so we can leave that to rest what does resting mean resting means where you've cooked a joint and you just leave it to relax so it'll make the meat so much more tender okay right coleslaw traditionally you would mix slaw with what mayonnaise that's right very nice this time we're gonna do it a little different so i'd like to put the yogurt into the bowl for me please all of it i'll start slicing the white cabbage and the red cabbage now from there a nice tablespoon of mustard in there please give that a nice mix up nice little touch of salt and pepper okay now a little cider vinegar so a little splash of cider vinegar in there okay as i shred this okay i'd like you please then to get the red cabbage and just open up into that and mix it in at the same time and then you fold that in there as i start shredding see how it's coming together yeah right that's all the red cabbage now the white so you've got that nice vinegary tartness to the slaw and the yogurt keeps it nice and fresh last little bit in one more little thing so put some nice chopped fresh chives in there and that will give it this nice light onion flavor so chives in [Music] how's that now taste it with the chives in there delicious so i'd like you to fill up the bowl i'm gonna very carefully lift out my brisket how come is it shrunk it's been in the oven for nearly three and a half hours so it's been cooked slowly that sits on there oh my goodness me let me just show you what this looks like i'll start slicing it and see how soft look at that and here's the thing about helping daddy cook here's the perk you get to taste it first before anybody that is so good that tastes delicious see all that wonderful flavor in there last job is to create an incredibly quick and delicious sauce gas on and reduce the spicy juices and onions the beef cooked in then add in cider vinegar and you've got a brilliant tangy barbecue sauce that smells nice doesn't it wow that is brisket and a half now the rest of it can go in the gravy pot that's a really nice rich spicy barbecue onion gravy that my daddy is the perfect way to serve brisket right you ready if you carry the sweet potato for me i've got the brisket wow let's go donny well done by the way thank you this is a real

If you liked this clip check out the rest...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, birch muesli traditionally gets made the night before and left in the fridge i find that a little bit too heavy and slightly stodgy so it's the same principles but a lot lighter first thing the yoghurt i think live and raw milk yogurt are best they're packed with calcium enzymes and probiotics which help your body absorb nutrients it's interesting because the kids especially would prefer their muesli with milk but the yoghurt so much better for them i like making it literally 10 minutes before i want to serve it because it doesn't become stodgy yogurt in apple juice that's a great way of sweetening the muesli a couple of tablespoons in give that little mix now sprinkle in the oats i like putting two thirds in now to absorb and almost double in size and the last third of oats in at the end oats are low on the glycemic index which means they slowly release energy to keep you going right through to lunch i quite like it when it just falls off the spoon you can see literally in seconds it's got thicker the rest of the oats in so i've got different textures now mix that up nicely and it literally takes three or four minutes to put together let's get a dry pan on almonds incredibly healthy toasting them even better flavor flake them into the pan lightly toast them that gives a really nice sort of crunch to the top of the muesli [Music] roll them around the pan so they're evenly toasted out into a bowl the exciting thing about putting your own music together is that you're in control blackberries summer raspberries strawberries and so it changes berries don't just taste great they're packed with antioxidants and vitamins c and k so just dot the top of your muesli with your blackberries generous on the blackberries sweetness tartness acidic and then just sprinkle over your nice almonds i quite like a lot of crunch on top so be generous that looks fantastic perfect way to start the day my quick birch and muesli doesn't just taste incredible it makes you feel fantastic it's my ultimate healthy breakfast there really is no better way to start the day [Music] a healthy diet is an important one but we're pretty relaxed about it my philosophy is simple try and eat less of the bad stuff and eat more of the good stuff and joining me in the kitchen is my netball nut youngest tilly for dinner it's amiga rich teriyaki salmon with a bug wheat soba noodle salad brimming with healthy greens and a light apparel spritz jelly for dessert first job the teriyaki marinade

If you...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] congratulations being the best brigade this is the final dinner but tonight the stakes are even higher because those guys out there are gonna be the toughest ever customers we've cooked for it's the first time i've filled the ration up with 50 vegetarians all wanted to be converted to eating meat this quite frankly is one of the most important meals you'll ever cook because if we [ __ ] this up you'll spoil their hopes are becoming meat eaters now there's pressure yes are you ready for the challenge yes i'm always ready now what's the menu mel um lobster and potatoes we have a really expensive looking canvas we're not allowed to waste yeah an amazing farm caviar yeah tastes like it's extraordinary stuff now before we start cooking yeah i want you to understand where it's come from yeah have a quick look at this on there one of my favorite ingredients in the world sums up food at its finest and most prestigious caviar very decadent very nutty very creamy and it's bursting with flavour like individual pearls exploding in your mouth absolutely delicious but classic wild caviar is under threat sturgeon and the caspian sea are overfished and close to extinction so the hunt is on to find alternatives fast so i'm looking for something sustainable and affordable to blow beluga out of the water when it comes to taste and texture i'm not gonna find it in [ __ ] knightsbridge i've come to andalusia in southern spain which for the past 25 years has hidden one of the mediterranean's best kept secrets if this caviar is as good as a real mccoy the proper beluga then this could be a [ __ ] amazing find here in spain it's the water flowing through these mountains that led the owners of rio frio caviar to set up a farm here after a seven year search for the perfect source export management fellow brit keith jaggart will be showing me around all right gordon how are you nice to meet you you're right now are you on half term you look about 12. now i didn't think it's possible to farm sturgeon why here in the middle of [ __ ] spain of all places the temperature of the water is 13 to 15 degrees all year round and that's because we have the source of the spring at 200 meters away from where we're standing drinkable drinkable and natural which is a benefit to the sturgeon of course so are we talking about as good as wild or better i i'd say better you've got a big pair of cohanas you know that i think honest yes i have [ __ ] me first keith's taking me to see the tiddlers that's so ugly yeah yeah so delicious and delicate yeah but it'll be eight years before he can tell the little boys from the big money girls who can be anything up to the age of 20 before their caviar's ready for harvesting oh god they're everywhere but first i've got to catch one if you can't grab the [Music] prehistoric distant relatives of the shark these big mothers are almost 60 kilos and to be examined for caviar they're wrestled out of the water by hand it's absolutely beautiful so how old is this one this one would probably be between 18 19 years old for nearly half that time the valuable eggs in this fish have been developing their size and condition are checked using ultrasound you can just about see every single egg i miss honestly identical to going with your wife for an ultrasound a little ky jelly rubbing around looking for the little heartbeat and oh [ __ ] that's too hard but you say you've got twins except here we're looking at what four and a half to five kilos kilos of caviar the trick is to catch the eggs at their optimum quality before the fish spawns naturally but this beauty isn't quite ready yet possibly six months we'll give it another another scan right and see how it's getting on if we just try and turn her around yeah come on okay oh [ __ ] okay there you go and then just slowly push it off just just very very calmly when the sturgeon are ready they're killed and sent for a clinical extraction [Music] this looks like a [ __ ] operating theater hola today chief sturgeon surgeon javier is entrusting me with a scalpel is that too deep again that's good just keep going that's perfect keep going okay let me see oh [ __ ] i can see kevin yeah it starts very far down i wish you told me jesus christ look at all that caviar in there look at that is that all the way up there my god okay so you can actually see look at that jesus christ you see the amount of eggs there look at all the caviar it's like a bathtub full of [ __ ] cabbage how much is in there i'm surprised you haven't got a security guard for each sturgeon in there you know that yeah under water we don't have security guards but we have big dogs do you mind have a little taste please no go ahead unbelievable it does need some salt on there in terms of flavor [ __ ] how this extras like a treasure i couldn't wait to learn how to transform these freshly harvested eggs into the delicacy i know and love so shall we process process [ __ ] me now i'm going back home see you later first the eggs are separated from the membrane so you're just gently rubbing it holding the membrane and we're not bursting the eggs like this no that is beautiful what's that worth in there now keith talking well over ten thousand pounds oh my god they're then rinsed in cold salted spring water before sea salt is added to dramatically enhance the caviar's flavor you do i don't want to [ __ ] up ten grand okay fingers in and just last right yeah faster faster okay very creamy for me it doesn't need any more salt that's delicious seasoned to perfection and matured for four months the caviar in this tin alone will be worth three and a half grand thank you thank you thank you pretty good gracias this stuff really does give wild caviar a run for its money and i've got the perfect recipe to show it off right lobster and potato salad with the most amazing mayonnaise and that special farmed caviar lobster towels with string as the lobster cooks tail stays nice and straight coat for six to seven minutes bay leaf lemon lime fennel star on his coriander bang pop all the potatoes once that's cooking mayonnaise add mustard powder and white wine vinegar to the egg yolks whisk whisk whisk slowly add the olive oil if we don't whisk it enough it splits now to the exciting part a little bit of truffle oil two or three little drops beautiful lobster out it's nice and straight so it's a lot easier to slice slice the potatoes season and drizzle with olive oil saute the potatoes and give the lobster a blast of heat in the pan literally 30 seconds each side that stops the lobster becoming really chewy and enhances the flavor lightly dress the salad and serve five nice slices of potato five nice medallions of lobster a teaspoon of truffle mayonnaise on the potato finishing the salad with this baby look at that absolutely amazing my god it has to be the perfect dish for the last supper a salad of potato lobster truffle mayonnaise and the most amazing [ __ ] caviar [Music] i've forgotten one nightmare that says you know that's right mel taylor and you've got [ __ ] everywhere no it's not it's not all right touch that lobster there stone cold yeah then you go to that as a hot lobster so this is most of the most talented brigade yes right now we're making biggins look good i didn't think that was possible what's that okay now i hope i ate another one [ __ ] you now we just dropped we have to keep going i'm ready i'm gonna send it out now that's a thousand pounds worth of caviar and you just put on the [ __ ] floor what's the one thing i asked you not to do drop the caviar just come here let me just show you seriously i want you guys looking good but if we perform like this we're going to look [ __ ] stupid and i'm going to get pissed off get a grip a bit yeah yeah and focus for me okay we need a little time to get used to it no time a thousand pounds worth of [ __ ] cover on the floor [Music] i've never really had lobster before but i really enjoyed it and i think this experience has made me want to eat fish probably from now on it's converted me that's nice color on potatoes there mel very nice merry lovely this is it last table and that's the caviar oh my god there's not even one egg on any of this anything on your spoon mary okay very good first of all empty plates which looks great did enjoy your starters i thought that having never had caviar before the combination with the lobster you got that nice salty texture with the more milder taste of the lobster and that popping of the caviar in your mouth i thought it was delicious i thought it was nice annoyingly nice results for the starter please the number okay i have customers that are happy to pay for their starter yes [Music] 4650 next on the menu i go hunting for puffin learning how to skyfish in iceland i'm just worried about standing up on the side of this and the starter has gone down well but the real test has yet to come for the vegetarian diners the bill main course i'm quite scared about eating the veal i'm really nervous about trying it i was okay with the lobster but now with me it's another hurdle to get through [Music] [Applause] right time for a very special main course janet's veal [Music] british rose veal a really nice alternative to beef and one of the most underused meats in the country seasoned hot pan olive oil [Applause] [Music] it's a very lean meat so they get very dry quickly literally 30 seconds each side rest masala sauce fresh oil in the pan [Music] shallots really important to use the same pan we want that flavour from the veal being sauteed mushrooms seasoned color masala reduce we're just rinsing the bottom of the pan out with all that amazing flavor chicken stock boil tomatoes tarragon chervil veal sit back in the sauce it just adds that really nice rich sweetness to the flavor of the veal [Applause] little treasure chest at british rose ville roseville with masala sauce done we're gonna put out all the stops and make sure that elton didn't dive all right now don't drop the veal i'll try not to right now mel be careful yeah whatever you do don't overcook the veal it cooks very very quickly both sides in and out it's a very lean piece of meat hardly any fats that are overcooked very quickly don't put the parcel of vinegar in the bed before everything's killed yes this will be a meal these diners will never ever forget for the rest of their lives that's all we got to do that's all we got to do well done go please yes that was my first meet in 12 years and it was it was pretty good actually i never ever thought veal was something that i would eat but yeah i'd probably go for it again after this it makes you want to sing when you're doing well we're doing well definitely i can't believe the way you're working it's night and day from the starters you're not letting elton down thank you for that it's amazing what you can get in iceland these days for the past 12 weeks i've traveled the world hunting for the freshest and finest ingredients for my final journey i've come to the end of the [ __ ] earth iceland is a stunning volcanic melting pot on the edge of the arctic circle it has some of the most extraordinary beautiful landscapes known to man and a unique food world to match this place is home to rotten shark whale meat and something i've always wanted to try puffing here they have a puffin feast on the menu i'm intrigued to see what it delivers in terms of texture and flavor and more importantly i'm dying to find out what it actually tastes like i'm sampling a starter of fresh salad with smoked puffing thank you and where's the puffin dunny it's all over here oh the dark bits see it's hiding in the bushes again yes it is see where is it thank you never tasted anything like it before i actually quite like it it's very creamy slightly gamey a little bit salty but quite intriguing because it's very smooth on the palette and obviously a [ __ ] nightmare to catch because there's hardly any on my [ __ ] plate puffin is such an amazing new ingredient i'm keen to grill the local chefs about it fascinating for me my first time eating puffin very dark yeah very dark rich bird yeah and it smells a little bit like liver it's quite quite quite dark like a lamborgh dark beet a little bit like game like you said yeah and yeah it really reads flavor i enjoyed it i'm intrigued by it thank you having tasted puffing for the first time i want to find out where they come from and learn the age-old way of hunting them so i'm moving further south i've seen some airports in my time but this is taking the piss [Applause] i'm heading to the westmon islands 10 miles off iceland's south coast there are more atlantic puffins on these remote islands than anywhere else in the world [Music] the birds are a traditional food hunted for centuries by locals like oliver tier ollie hi there hi there good to see you welcome to westmill islands thank you now you look like a little puffy bulky sturdy yeah there you go full of stamina yeah can you fly not really but i'm always hoping to so you need a lot of puffins in the uk yeah everyone right now will be thinking oh my god they're cute they're beautiful they're lovely beaks we've got them as teddy bears for the kids why in the hell are you eating them well to begin with a lot of them around here the four or five million perfect so they're in abundance the traditional food in western islands are the puffins especially smoked perfect so it goes back centuries ago in terms of a staple food supply that the island survived on yeah yeah and just tastes very good the method oliver uses to catch them is hundreds of years old what is that thing it's called hour how howard power yeah well it's close enough okay let's just call it a pole vault with a net on the end okay you can call it whatever you like i called howard there are no puffings on this open part of the island so it's perfect for practicing sky fishing i would wait for the puffin flying this way slowly after they and turn and then they will fly into the net take the puffing out and break the neck have a little go the bird they're flying that direction follow follow follow following back why don't we just get a gun and shoot them it's just more of a sport yeah but i shoot them you catch them in the air yeah as they fall at this car the official hunting season doesn't start until tomorrow which gives me plenty of time to perfect my swing got him yeah okay i've got it and cook another part of my puffing menu a traditional icelandic bread right i'm going to make a really nice rustic bread to go with the puffins for tomorrow i'm adding yeast to rye flour wholemeal flour salt and sugar a little well in the center add the milk in three stages knead the dough until firm and that's what we're looking for that really nice smooth beautiful rustic dough into the tin i'm finishing the bread with blowderg a traditional icelandic flower when you rub them together it releases amazing oil it's a sort of cross between lavender and rosemary as that cooks it's going to perfume the bread smells amazing lid on now i'm gonna bake that bread in the biggest oven i've ever seen in my entire [ __ ] life [Music] this is mount elfell a volcano that erupted and changed the face of the islands just 35 years ago with the crater still hot enough to bake a loaf [Music] so this is the oven and the deeper you go yep the hotter it is yes honestly when that is absolutely incredible ah the heat yeah i feel how hot that is it's extraordinary how long in the other two hours yeah only the vikings were thinking about digging deep under a volcanic rock hardberg being a baker yeah but i mean how do i put the work in especially not paying for the gas the bread will bake overnight and tomorrow the official puffing hunting season on the westman islands will begin one two grandma three i'm very well good to see you welcome to the f-word thank you very much enjoy your food now are you being sparing with elton because not enough to go around well we've

bit like your beer it hasn't changed my mind [Laughter] i thought that actually meat would be something that i would really detest but actually i find it's fantastic yeah how was your feel young man would it be bad to say really good i'm so pleased you know that it was an amazing journey to get them to the table but i feel really bad because i haven't eaten meat for such a long time how long 20 years 20 years yeah you didn't look that old how old are you 26 and you've never eaten meat in 20 years i had a bacon sandwich about four years ago and that's it that's it that's fantastic news i just think 20 years all those vegetables no wonder your hair's so curly extraordinary i'm so pleased we've converted you i really really like the beer i really think compliments a meal dougal nice to see you sir you're looking very smart so now that for me was an amazing journey yes how was the experience for you drinking it alongside the veal i think in this particular case you got a lot of sweetness there in the beer and the veal for me was sweet it had a caramel flavor on the outside and the two complemented each other beautifully yeah and there's that oaky character just a little hint of that sort of vanilla yeah i think the whole lot went together beautifully better than the wine i thought thank you for your help with that that is delicious um good to see you thank you so much hi tom hello janet hi john well done yeah tremendous veal yeah the veal tastes great delicious tom did enjoy the beer i thought it was a good bit it was definitely a proper ale yeah it wasn't a lager it was definitely a sopping in a country park right results in main course tough out there 50 vegetarians they're not just normal punters they've arrived here this evening to have meat for the first time in years and i'm not talking about six seven eight months i'm talking about years five ten sometimes fifteen twenty years okay the number of people that are willing to pay look is 46 out of 50. that is amazing that is amazing you definitely did not let elton down well done coming up i go back to the field of dreams where my football career started home and ended there's some fantastic memories and there's some tragic memories and graham norton's making a peach of a dessert in the recipe challenge i'm going to make a delicious roast peach and amaretto dessert as gordon might say it's sweet juicy and full of flavor [Music] [Applause] right it's recipe challenge time and tonight's challenger is comedian presenter national treasure graham norton but there's more at stake because whichever dessert the blind tasters choose will be served to all the diners so are you ready i'm very ready what are you doing basically it's a roast baked peaches rice with um amoresso and lavender here's one i made earlier i'm gonna make a delicious roast peach and amaretto dessert as gordon might say it's sweet juicy and full of flavor boiling water peel slice them in two take out a little pity bit that's quite hard to do [ __ ] look after that there you go bowl amaretto maple syrup sugar slop that around a bit perhaps i should have tasted that let's find it tray pour the oven five minutes already lavender oven five minutes out plate creme fraiche amaretti biscuits lavender delicious roast peaches with amaretto dessert done so graham's doing a roasted peach stroke braised peach with lavender yeah some of the oven in the oven yeah oven cooked served on a plate what do you want blood gordon served on i thought it sounds as delicious as it was so graham's doing the dish roasted peaches with lavender served on a plate with amaretti biscuits i'm gonna smartass roasted peaches with a delicious lemon and lime and basil creme fresh water sugar boil take your knives peaches basil poach take them out of the syrup peel and the stone should just fall out syrup gramanio boil icing sugar into the oven six to seven minutes to beautifully roast creme fraiche lemon zest lime zest basil mix marzipan roll out your marzipan nice and thin cut glaze assemble creme fresh marzipan [Music] [Applause] peach out the oven onto the creme fraiche and sit the other half on top raspberry cooley toasted almonds roasted peaches with lemon lime and basil creme fresh done now why didn't you choose this dish because i tried it in a restaurant all night and this was delicious yeah and i thought very simple i could probably cook this yeah and do you get a chance to cook at home cooking's fun when there's time to do it yes do you mean because it's lovely having people over but if it's stressful what's the point so you're gonna blanch them first in like uh i've done that syrup peel them yeah doing it so you don't like skin you don't like the skin of the peaches so it looks like you made some effort you actually did this is the only bit of cooking involved the brigade will be so happy if i win because it is a piece of piss now used to be a waiter i did yes were you a good waiter uh i sometimes i started off being good and then you just you know people are making fun and you say it's your [ __ ] dinner you'll eat again you know but where's our food i'm guessing it's in the kitchen i don't have it did you ever thicken anybody's vinaigrette when you're pissed off with a customer we did do something horrible to somebody's coffee once we did something in the cafeteria before we put the hot water in and we just did it behind the bar so like someone could have seen us do it what exactly did he do there was might have been a little piss in the coffee but the wrong person drank it the restaurant the restaurant is shot now but it's not our fault okay good yeah yeah a little touchy grime on you oh the old grandma oh yeah yeah over the top and then a little bit of the sort of cooking juice do you like to take food to the bedroom is it something you sort of no no no no i mean it's fine in hotels yes i think sex hotels is very different to sex at home yes sex at home someone's got to clean this up you know laundry will be done yeah i remember trying to be romantic once with rose petals they staying the [ __ ] out of sheets it looked like i killed someone are you romantic um i try seriously but not really no no see because how long have you been married now uh 11 years 11 11 years i know see that's a mystery to me a mystery in terms of of just staying with someone for 11 years really i sat outside i didn't know people last night they were married for 25 years 25 years 25 and what was that what what was the the secret behind that one i didn't ask oh well actually the secret is that the husband is denzel washington who's going to leave him right off you go top and bottom uh just in there [Laughter] look at you just like that excellent right i'm going on top they go in the oven we come back and we find out which desserts can be served to the diners are you confident you know quietly confident that doesn't look as good as i thought it would you [ __ ] now i'm taking my fight for health eating back to my old stomping ground as a boy i dreamt of playing professional football for my favorite local team glasgow rangers [Music] my dream came true when i was spotted by a scout in the mid-80s and i joined the youth team here at ibrox [Music] i've got so many great memories including playing alongside one of scotland's football legends koisi perhaps one of the most recognized one of the most famous players ever to grace the field at ibrox mccoy making the run and a marvelous opening goal remember them well and the one thing that's stuck here but gone the one that's never ever changed and never will change he's a he's a competitor of so-and-so that wants to want to do the best and be the best they can wow home sweet home beautiful there's some fantastic memories and there's some tragic memories there's no other club like it anywhere in the world wow the terrible memories were coming through those main doors and being sent upstairs to the bosses office and to be told that you're no longer part of rangers that's a big kick in the bollocks trust me i got released on the back of an injury um smashed my cartilage and then they said they'd keep an eye on me but that's just a polite [ __ ] off really that's all [Music] do you know what any form of pain that i experienced here was eradicated when i won my third michigan star and had i not had the upset in football here with ibrox i don't think i'll be the chef i am today when i played we ate steak and chips pie and beans and training was basic run till you drop now that's all changed for the better but football astringent diets can be bland and most of them have never set foot in the kitchen which is something i'd like to change i'm at murray park rangers training ground i meet my old friend alan mccoy to see what they're up to hopefully hasn't put too much weight on oh never mind your watch boy how are you doing you've lost weight i've washed the beef actually since you gave me that telling off last time i'll show you my happy to be here what are you training yeah we're gonna give our training about work and stuff then i joined the squad for a full-on training session times like this when you seriously get to understand how much you miss it followed by three punishing quick fire [Music] matches training over i'm joining ali for an infamous rangers routine the ice tub [Applause] i've got the perfect thing to warm our frozen cockles a tasty hot lunch for the lads that should prove healthy food doesn't need to be bland and boring right i'm in the kitchens of murray park here coy so you know and this man bay folks and captain of rangers and scotland when's the last time you're in the kitchen mike was the two two years all right so i'm going to do the most amazing chicken dish poached and sauteed chicken breast harika bean salad and balsamic roasted fennel we're kicking off with the fennel cut into quarters smell it add a seed lovely nice and fresh fragrant seasoned drizzled olive oil and balsamic vinegar you never cook at home no yeah my way you've cooked straight into the oven 200 degrees 12 to 15 minutes does it get any harder yes it does move your ass chicken breast free range high in protein low in fat just what these players need to keep them running we're just going to poach them now for six minutes half a bowl of garlic a little bit of thyme rosemary make the chicken a lot more fragrant we're just trying to make it more exciting yeah and no sauces no cream no butter and something you can get up and feel energized with gonna make a vinaigrette berry right okay mustard olive oil balsamic vinegar go easy on the salt because that dehydration even quicker now for the second half bean salad beans packed with protein olives help to season and stop them becoming a little bit bland a couple of tablespoons of vinaigrette this is baby spinach yeah packed with iron tossed with basil leaves and a splash of the dressing chicken out and skin side down i never thought i'd see the day scotland's captain and the most prolific goal scorer arranges ever golden food in front of the stove hey what you don't have that sweat on gordon yeah don't sweat in the chicken though anyone complains about it being [ __ ] salty i know who to blame half a ladle of stock in there that's gonna act almost like a bit of a sauce really crispy skin yeah nice moist chicken inside drizzle the roasted fennel with vinaigrette to serve a handful of spinach salad and just sit the fennel on top get a nice even distribution of the beans and the olives slice the chicken and spoon on some vinaigrette here we go you know what they're gonna say they don't like it whether they like it [Music] so ally you can do that again for the guys i would do that again for the voice yes good good good good coming up i'm back in stunning iceland [Music] on the edge of a cliff risking life and limb to hunt for puffing i'm [ __ ] myself relax be part of the nature [Applause] right welcome back now time to find out the results of the recipe challenge and which dessert will be served to our diners that does look quite nice though it does look quite nice i'm a big fan of the white place but i think for a dessert you can go a bit colorful right jose good luck graeme dan to you sir yes your hands are all sticky of course they are i'm covering maple syrup hello i really think the texture of the peach is quite nice cream works very well with the pink i like the almonds in there yeah i love the love of the fragrance it's really nice and the presentation is absolutely terrific i think this is presented a bit nicely in the last dish and much for further source than having the lavender i think it works a lot better i actually find that the sauce a bit too sharp in this one i actually prefer the previous one with the honey i get nervous about this [ __ ] yeah i'm a little bit nervous no because those little bits of lavender flowers last challenge of the series okay oh look at that face and i don't look i don't know what that means how did it go down well it was close oh god it always softens it with that one this people comes in gives it a low blow so what do they say about them well they did like the marzipan and the raspberry and yours of course they would yeah nice but they like the the balance of flavor from green sponsor forget the balance whose dessert is getting served to the diners come on if you want a job jose come on come on don't look at him like that i'm going yeah i'm sorry granny yeah well done look at that place i'm so strong no i'm still going to do that i'll still be cooking at home i don't care i don't care i can't believe they like marzipan i thought your dish was delicious thank you very much a little bit too much alcohol for me but it was delicious um oh that's so not true never enough it's been a pleasure it's been a pleasure being here and i just feel sorry for the brigade now to cook your really dreadery complicated dessert right do me a favor yeah [ __ ] about my kitchen now goodbye thank you goodbye cheers gordon thank you graeme yes i've traveled 1 200 miles to the westmon islands off the south coast of iceland to hunt a delicious local delicacy puffin it's the first day of the season and to catch them we're heading even further afield to one of ollie's best hunting spots so where are we going to hunt the puffins uh it's on the other side of the island yeah in the middle no not in the middle on the edge on the edge yeah what do you mean like that [ __ ] olly you're mad this is eck liver a one of the westman's 14 uninhabited islands it was difficult to access from the water and having clambered to the top for an hour i couldn't quite believe where i ended up [Music] we're perched on the edge of a cliff with an 80 meter drop into the north atlantic ocean i'm [ __ ] myself relax be part of the nature the puffins circle the edge catching the wind and it didn't take long for ollie to show me exactly how it's done yep yeah ah that was quick yep hold the leg width hold it like that under the wings yes under the wings the first one of the season is released ready beautiful you're one lucky little [ __ ] like my [ __ ] nose it lags you know [ __ ] [ __ ] slice my nose you little bastard ready yeah and go that's the last time i'm kissing a [ __ ] puffin i start [ __ ] around we're on the side of a cliff huh at 250 feet this wasn't going to be easy very close very close i'm just worried about standing up on the side of this well you shouldn't worry too much no forget that together ollie makes sky fishing look easy but i spent three hours on the cliff without catching a thing it's lit is far there's no way on earth i can go home with a big [ __ ] cut on my nose and no puffins trust me it's a lot more difficult than i thought it would be moving to the other side of the island we were hoping our luck might change oh i was not letting that one go okay no chance you want stuff jesus christ almighty huh it had taken five hours but i'd finally got the hang of it fantastic that was high that one that's good very good puffing number two we could have gone on catching for hours but i only needed a couple of puffins to cook with so i decided to set my third one free i'm gonna let this one go first day of the season [Applause] you got two i got two that's a good number that's a good number let's go back on the main island ollie showed me the best way to de-breast the birds just break snap and break yep right and then do it like this it's ready to do that's incredible yeah in here you have the heart the heart yeah yeah you want one would you eat that iceland's very own hannibal lecter then it was my turn oh you have a heart as well ollie come on come on don't be a chicken it's a puffin you're bitten by one and then you can eat it doesn't taste bad oh [ __ ] i can't believe you just made me that hard right hannibal let me show you how to cook them [ __ ] properly you stay here yeah i look forward to this unbelievable the volcanic bread i made yesterday turned out to be a big hit with the locals because overnight it got nicked but it was the puffing i was here for and i couldn't wait to cook with it marinade puffing breast in brenovin take the breast off the bone [Music] just a tad larger than a pigeon breast but a hundred times tastier i'm making a marinade for the puffing with crushed juniper berries salt pepper and olive oil two-thirds olive oil and one-third brennervin brennevin is a local liqueur like a schnapps mmm lovely and then puffin straight into the marinade whilst the puffin marinades i'm making a salad with skir an icelandic yogurt cucumber garlic and mint the nice thing about this cucumber salad it cools down the richness of the puffing just slice through the breast get your rosemary twig push it through and the nice thing about that as it cooks it perfumes inside that puffing breast it's a very lean bird so i don't want this thing to dry out for the barbecue cherry tomatoes on the vine drenched with olive oil and balsamic vinegar and now for the puffing straight on the barbecue [Music] lovely literally one minute each side and once i barbecue them they're going back in the marinade nice bread now unfortunately bread got nicked last night so this is what olly cooked at his house the tomatoes just sat on the bread skin cucumber salad and then this our puffing breast just pull out the rosemary wow that is delicious and that is our perfect puffin fit for any [ __ ] viking oli's invited his sons down to see if my puffin passes the test i'm dying to see what you think in terms of flavor have you ever eaten it that rare nope this tastes much better than i ever expected really yeah good man for me the flavour of puffing is unique i love it and here's the good news yeah now i've got my license yeah i'm coming back you've got your laser yes then we have a real competition [Music] the sharpness of the peaches and the cooling just went really well with the sweet marzipan which is brilliant a little mini explosion of happiness in my mouth i don't think i'm exaggerating when i say this is [ __ ] time for the results for the dessert right the number of diners that are willing to pay for the dessert is 43 out of 50. well done you got 135 out of 150 jose champagne please let's go well done thank you well good luck with the bacon sandwiches tomorrow you

If you liked...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, as a chef i know it's not what you spend on ingredients but results on the plate that count using cheap cuts and leftovers and working them hard in the kitchen gives you food in a budget that tastes a million bucks first up my flavor-packed lamb with fried bread whether i'm cooking high-end dishes or rustic dishes trust me it all has to be impressive so this lamb dish proves that you don't have to spend a fortune to create delicious food first off put the pan on this is a lamb steak and it's cut just above the leg just here because you can see that delicious bone running through the center and that's full of marrow so that just gives the lamb a nice added sweet flavor just take your knife cut through each end this stops the lamb steak from buckling so therefore it cooks evenly and colors beautifully salt and pepper lamb needs quite a lot of help with the pepper so be quite generous with the pepper and just pat that down the pan is just under smoke on the outside now put the oil in get that pan really nice and hot because this is a cheap cut so i'm depending on the color of the lamb steak to really sort of impart a lot of flavor that's the noise you want to hear you can't hear that noise don't drop a steak in put a little bit of garlic in there not chopped garlic just whole cloves the garlic lightly crushed don't even waste time peeling them in tongs lift up that bit of fat around the back that's the top of the leg tilt the pan and let all that fat render rendering is a chef's term that means melting the fat it works brilliantly when you're cooking a rib eye as well turn it over that color beautiful now it looks like an expensive cut and we've got that nice even sear all over as it's cooking just tilt the pan and vase and basting the lamb steak just means you're sort of adding all that nice scented garlic olive oil back into the lamb diesel now take the lamb out let the lamb restaurant [Music] now for the perfect rustic crouton so this bread's quite firm a couple of days old just slice it straight down the center dice it up put it into a bowl season it beautifully from there i'm gonna add some milk sounds strange adding milk to crouton but it just gives it that nice rich creamy texture and just let that milk sort of absorb into the bread while that's soaking i'm gonna make the dressing go back to that initial garlic that was in the pan look at that beautiful into the pest and water and chives anchovies go brilliantly well with lamb i want that nice salty vinegary flavor and a bit of kick some capers the little baby cats very sweet now just pound that to a nice paste that smells incredible next some dijon mustard a nice teaspoon and a half in a little bit of red wine vinegar two tablespoons and then our extra virgin olive oil now it's got that heat in there i've got a nice roasted garlic a real hearty chunky vinaigrette that sort of seeps into that lamb some fresh parsley crunch up the parsley delicious flavor parsley in nice now get your pan hot for the croutons olive oil in the pan grab the croutons and squeeze all that excess milk out not too hard i don't want them dry and in and then just fry them and the milk inside these croutons give it a nice spongy creamy delicious flavor that's the color i want nice now take them out and lightly drain them a little bit of kitchen roll onto the board out a plateman just take this amazing vinaigrette and spread it get those croutons listen to them like little boulders hitting the plate the lamb let's sit that one next one on the rest of the croutons on now use all those little bits and my chef in paris would kill me right now if you saw me using those because they're the ugly scraps that customers should never see but but they're the best bits croutons on and then just drop that sauce on all those little bits of the lamb and there that is a perfect way of taking a cheap cut into the premier league of dishes for dishes that always pack a punch without costing a fortune simple and cheap delicious ingredients like sausages are great and you don't need a lot of them to get stunning dishes that taste incredible so spend your money wisely and you can have amazing midweek meals that don't cost the earth my next recipe is all about great flavors and it's as cheap and easy to make as it is delicious spicy sausage rice whatever you're cooking the secret to making great food is to ensure you're locking every last ounce of flavor in that pan and this spicy sausage rice does exactly that [Music] take these spicy sausages and pierce that skin because i want all that delicious spicy sausage meat out of this casing and you get more flavor from the sausage when you take them out the casing sausage is ready turn on the gas bread onion less acidic than a big white spanish onion and a lot more flavoursome tablespoon of olive oil a tablespoon only because i want all that fat coming out the sausages to sort of really help flavor the onions onions in and the onions go in first because you can never rush cooking an onion it's really important to sort of give them five to six minutes in the pan so you can really start to caramelize them and now for my pepper slice around wasting nothing i want to see that sort of little core those pips in the center no fine diced pepper the rice is going to be cooking for 20 minutes so i want the veg to sort of have texture after it's cooked peppers in a bit of garlic two nice cloves just slap down off of the shell garlic in now i want to turn up the gas get the pan nice and hot because the minute that sausage goes in everything cools down and you'll end up boiling the peppers and the onions of the garlic so heat up to maximum and then just make a well in the center in now start stirring quickly this is where you get so much more bang for your buck out of sausages because the skins off and the real flavor of that spicy italian sausage is going to come through what's great about this recipe is that you can use any type of sausage to get the flavor and the heat you want i've gone for the spicy italian but it's just as good with merguez or sweet so a teaspoon paprika in give it that really nice smoky flavor rice in and we're gonna sort of basically sear the rice we call it in the kitchen blasting the rice where we sort of soda the rice for 30 seconds and it takes on all that flavor next white wine so the wine sort of deglazes the pan and washes all that flavor from the bottom of the pan into the rice stock in bring it up to the boil turn it down and let it simmer [Music] double stop to rice turn that gas down and let it simmer for 12 to 15 minutes and just give it the occasional stir keep an eye on it now get ready to finish it slice

haven't got the color on the nokia the butter will burn yes yeah okay good no stop stop stop stop well they look overcooked now yeah they are completely overcooked keep keep that down a bit more bubble just reduce it a bit more yeah who the bubba is right okay that's much better jade much better yeah now you're getting the feel for it now emma when's the last time you turned the gas up and down at home i don't i don't cook he doesn't let me either though you know when i try he gets really angry is he that possible he gets angry with me and he tells me to get out so what do you do the washing up no i do the wine i did i put my heels on and i look because four plate towels from there yeah on there like that's gonna do that yeah off you go clean your plates finish it with pecorino yeah and on the hot plate quick quick quick let's go quickly right here's janet street party for the last four months janet street porter has been on a mission to persuade the public to eat british rose veal they're going to go to the slaughter house we're going to slaughter them and then we're going to eat them last week she said goodbye to evil calves david and elton but her biggest test lies ahead [Music] preparations are underway for a very special party up in yorkshire i'm going to cook one of janet's field cards in the f word restaurant next week but today janet is going to serve the other calf to 100 of her neighbors in yorkshire it's a big challenge for many of the locals this will be the first time they've tried veal it's crucial it tastes sensational and that's the job of the chef tim clements there he is there he is right that looks pretty heavy will it rotate on the spit i i hope so what if it's too heavy i hope so well then we go move to plan b what's plan b i'm not quite sure yet janet wants as many people as possible to try her veal so she decided to spit-roast the entire animal a real challenge since veal is very lean and spit roasts are normally reserved for much fattier meats like pork it's going to be a delicate operation so how are you going to stop it drying out we're going to keep marinating it and we're off better be good otherwise golden will be gloating the meat is cooking and janet's keen to convert the entire village to british rose veal so she wants everyone to join the party will you come oh i can oh right you can do it you can do the blessing at the meal will you do the flowers sorry to interrupt your rehearsals have you ever eaten feel no i feel like i don't know have i eaten i need a bit of entertainment we don't want anything to have on guard to put people off their meals [Laughter] janet's managed to persuade most of the village into coming to her veal meal that's only half the job she also needs to make sure they love the meat they eat after months of janet's care it's crucial that david's cooked to perfection so the meat is constantly basting with rosemary and olive oil as it slowly cooks wrapped in full to keep the juices in someone have a taste would you like to have a chicken no i want to taste it along with everybody else if it's cooked now i think it'll be over cooked i don't think it will be we don't let's hope she's made the right choice to spit roast david or her months of careful preparation will have gone to waste and i guess may be going home hungry [Music] four more way please yes jade yes keep up the energy yeah come on yes let's go pan on good right right when they're brand they're cooked they're black they're what yeah are you color blind um no chef anton yes yeah you know when

that's for sure the elite emergency response unit you're dealing with all sorts and you're eating you should be  ashamed of yourselves i'm shocked by what these guys are eating especially considering the physical nature of their job a few hours before the morning rush hour i'm taken to a disused station to see what these boys do for london's commuters could not just take the list lift unfortunately it's not working a faulty train pulls in and we get down to work the electricity on the line is turned off and a short circuit device is stored in case the current comes back on how do

20 stone blokes i'm gonna take gold under with you now then anyone suffering from claustrophobic down here i mean you're up we're replacing a damaged wheel so the first thing we need to do is to raise the 25 ton carriage using hydraulic jacks are we gonna yeah we are going up just trying to keep it square yeah off you go boys down you go get them back under their orders you want to blow yeah no no

extraordinary eight to ten minutes in there 220 degrees yeah 20 degrees beautiful vine tomatoes really simple yeah delicious really healthy lots of vitamin c rye bread is very high in fiber and packed with vitamins and iron better than the white sliced cardboard they're used to that is a mushroom and a half i'm going to poach an egg a little secret touch of vinegar in the water and i just stir the

should all be eating regularly the veal has been spit-roasted for eight hours and is nearly ready for eating have you had to look at it looks good i was really worried about spit roasting because i didn't think it was right but the way that he's done it i'm cooking him really really slowly all right people have come from all over the valley even the mayor's come for dinner hi there hello hi welcome to the upper dial get stuck in have you had a look at it the weather's great let's hope the veal is too oh how's he doing all right looks good it's looking all right isn't it all she needs now

roast with rosemary and olive oil marinade is finished janet's farming skills have been put to the test and now it's time to see if it's all been worth it it's chewy in that but it's still gorgeous [Music] just how it should be you've got a big potion it tastes lovely spit roasting if you've got a really bad idea fighting gonna be really dry but it's not it's absolutely gorgeous i'm up in the second i've never had feel in my life i've seen it on many menus and never picture but i will now yeah it's terrific it's a roaring success the lean and tasty bill was cooked to perfection and everyone's tucking into the feast but just when you think it's safe to relax i just want to have your attention for a minute but shut up for a minute sorry i want to thank you all so much for coming tonight everybody cares about these bloody calves the other day i went through the airport a gatwick security man came up to me i thought oh i'm gonna have one of those embarrassing body searches do what they had a brilliant life and what we wanted to show by rearing the calves here was that not only is it wonderful me but that it's a way of using animals just go around and tell all your mates british feel is great [Applause] janet's veal meal has gone down a storm and she's made some new friends too the only thing we slipped up with tonight because don't tell me you're moaning about it no no no no no we should have brought some raffle prizes if you're up [Laughter] janet seems to be on to a winner she's got the people of nidadele eating british for you now it's time for the rest of us to give it a go [Music] hello hello my darling [Laughter] trees are nice and bright and you know good my veil mail was a triumph it's going to be a hard act for you to be serious are they all obsessed with veal now in north yorkshire all of them loved it they're not just scared of you in a way that they just said most of the people there had not eaten veal before and they adored it did you enjoy being a farmer i really enjoy being a farmer but then i take my hat off to real farmers because they work every hour god sends for very little money and it's a tough job you did a good job it's maybe a more caring sharing person so it's a miracle i just want to give you these what have you got for me as a little present to say oh god gordon it's so uncharacteristic thank you nice names i really seriously appreciate it yes can't wait to cook elton i look forward to seeing you next week lovely thank you such feminine colors just for you my darling i've never tried oversold before it was quite a life fish it was melt in your mouth i thought the nestle trap was very nice bit different but then the capers and the shrimps were a wee bit salty excellent nice combination of um the shrimp and the capers capers overwhelms the flavour a little bit too much but otherwise lovely right results main course yes jade first of all i was impressed with the way you ran the pass yeah thank you good job thank you i think you may be quite cut out for this chef right jose let's go give me the results please thank you right the number of guests that are happy to pay for the main course is 30 out of 50.

o'connor likes to nibble on between shoots i watch the quality of what i put into my mouth that's really important big difference that's my message to the girls and jon snow resorts to desperate measures trying to put me off in the recipe challenge thank god you're a talented news reader welcome back the f-word now time for the recipe challenge and time to find out whether jon snow can make a few headlines of his own are you ready sir i am ready jordan yeah now good to see you what are you making i am making uh organic salmon phillips on a bed of beans pine nuts and a few other surprises right that sounds a little bit like a jamie oliver recipe it could be that that's what its origins are but it's been um organicized organicized right i'm gonna do a really nice pan seared fillet of salmon with really nice summer broth how long do you sear it for well do you know what i'm gonna leave it a really intense color and then just allow it to sort of rest on the side you're just like a politician you don't actually answer the question how long are you gonna serious before if i told you i'm gonna see it for two minutes right thank you very much needed to know i was going to go for three i got you two now john your potatoes are burning oh oh gosh so what was your mom's food like when you were growing up it was classic english food really bread and butter pudding nice roast beef yorkshire pud toad in the hole oh lovely uh all the sort of things which would make you very fat uh right my vegetables now first swim off with no color so just into a pan low heat a touch of salt touch a pepper i've got the spuds done so they're really only for dressing i've got some garlic stripped ready for crushing but i haven't crushed it so i'm a little bit of a mess but i'm getting there this dish is looking very technical of yours johnny it is of course very powerful yeah but i know i should have forgotten something absolutely critical and fundamental well that would be fantastic if you have i know i know now your father was a clergyman and you're a news reader so is your news desk a pulpit it's a very interesting question i don't know i don't know i mean no no no because i'm not sort of i'm not into morality or faith or any of that this is an interest you have strong views don't you yeah interestingly similar sort of occupation yeah certainly a performance isn't it yeah well you don't get the clothes he had fabulous clothes oh really and the hat eight foot in a miter they're extraordinary foot just imagine a clunk bat and you have your ties outlandish yeah yes they have to be abstract they must say anything have you ever counted them uh i know but i i think they're always about 100 because you know you be like you i'm sure that you send your wooden spoons to the auction for charity well i i send my ties what's your favorite tie what colors do you go for bright colors i was told never to wear bright colors on television really so i wear bright colors on top of it is it like bow tie equals small i don't know i don't know if i've got a problem or not i haven't noticed it if i have but if i have i accept it so right vegetables that's all looking a little overdone uh no it's not looking well done we just sweat them off with no color a couple of tablespoons of white wine reduce that down then add vegetable stock so i've drained my vegetables out there now because vegetables are cooked added the vegetable stock we'll reduce that down and finish up the touch of creme fraiche fresh basil and coriander then put my peas and fresh broad beans in then not looking what i intended now i'm gonna finish the top of my salmon with a really nice walnut pesto garlic in john this is not going well john you lived in uganda yes i did yeah is it true you can sing ugandan national anthem yes that's amazing thank god you're a talented news reader very nice yeah it has a certain delicious craft i'm just finishing my sauce with a touch of creme fraiche looking a very much nicer color than mine i'm slightly nervous uh yeah i've got a very slight element of self-doubt just the moment a little rescue job has to go on here we gotta clean that up somehow yeah finishing my sauce with fresh basil and fresh coriander oh my god what i've done is i've got the beans ready and they're just on their moment i see an air of panic over here okay something's going on okay hell right now someone's got to cook for two minutes john's going off to change his tie and then the blind taste will come back and give john the bad news [Music] right i'm on a mission to get everyone eating healthy food this week i'm turning my attention to a good looking group of people who've got a bad reputation when it comes to diets [Music] a model's body is her livelihood so why do so many of them eat so badly i'm off to glean some words of wisdom from supermodel erin o'connor we should measure you sure let's have a competition actually you're over since we're actually six foot one come on having been in the business for ten years erin recently set up the model sanctuary a bolt hole which offers everything from counselling to practical nutritional advice six two and a half six two and a half very important i've come to her agency to find out why young models struggle so much with their diet how about the pressure in terms of their eating we get a lot of models in and out of the restaurants and they sort of come in they dip in they dip out but they don't really eat they think they don't really embrace the food i think they're scared so maybe i'm a good advocate for this because yes i do watch what i eat but i watch the quality of what i put into my mouth right that's really important and that's my message to the girls erin's always been naturally thin and two years ago she found herself becoming the unwitting poster girl for size zero despite improvements in the industry erin's well aware young models are still vulnerable how bad's the problem now in terms of their eating habits they're young people they literally they've left their parents for the first time who've cooked their meals for them from that age and actually they go to a foreign land they don't know where they are they don't have the ingredients accessible to them and they can't cook it's a short sharp exciting career that spans if you're lucky 10 to 12 years three years i represent a minority i've been going for over 10 years now i mean i'm practically a granny how old are you now i'm 30. christ you old bag i know hi so isn't it you know working 30 old bags who cares how old are you gordon 31 are you so your big worry now is not so much the pressure but these young girls can't cook um don't have the time to don't have the time to cook i'm just trying to encourage and make fun of the benefits of eating well and positively do you cook at home i do what's the last thing you cooked last night i cooked brown rice salmon and add a bit of salad so it's lovely and was the garlic in the brown rice i did just do aaron knows that to keep looking good you have to eat healthily but there are still a few models at our agency who don't i'm going to be meeting georgina georgina is is a perfect example of a lot of young models she is going to have a fast-paced life and she's got to know and she's got to see the benefits of looking at number one [Music] in london with 18 year old model georgina toms now she got spotty outside woolworths in manchester a few years ago and she's been freshly modelling now for the last two years she's a lot of crap i eat biscuits lots of biscuits chocolate a lot pizza and crap stuff probably student kind of diet i suppose alcohol and all that good stuff for you the average model's career lasts for just three years georgina may look great now but if she carries on like this her shelf life could be shorter than a packet of her favorite biscuits so i'm here to show how easy it is to cook and eat a balanced healthy diet great chance hi georgina hi how are you all right traveling wise are you traveling a lot yeah in the past months i've been to hamburg milan and madrid how do you eat when you're on the fly like this um whatever's available what's up available but that's not what you have for lunch is it no that's just snacks i can eat half a packet of biscuits a day if i want to half a packet no chance yeah seriously yeah i like biscuits it's like my downfall are you confident in the kitchen um i can do it but i might like burn myself accidentally no that's not gonna happen get changed we'll go to the kitchen and we'll cook something vibrant healthy and incredibly easy okay okay i'm going to prove to georgina that healthy food can be every bit as tasty as a beloved biscuits and chocolate pancake tuna with really nice couscous and some roasted vegetables chop the veg peppers courgettes leeks and red onions okay do we need lots of onions i don't like them you don't like onion once they're roasted in olive oil you'll be surprised mixed together with olive oil salt and pepper [Music] to serve alongside i'm using couscous which is low in fat and high in fiber add a dash of olive oil and pour over the hot stock cover with clin film and leave it for 15 to 20 minutes to make a really quick vinaigrette just two thirds extra virgin olive oil a little bit of salt a little bit of pepper a little touch of white wine vinegar fresh lemon juice and zest now for the tuna crush some coriander seeds with some seasoning this is like probably manual labor in it labor of love it'll be worth it get some willy in there season the tuna and coat with olive oil and the crushed coriander heat a frying pan then add the olive oil and sear the tuna take out and leave the rest for a few minutes take our vinaigrette all nice lemony now with the couscous i keep on shaking the bowl i've got to move it all now it's all stuck at the bottom that's why we give it a good shake now so it doesn't become stolen [Music] add fresh coriander lemon zest and juice and a couple of spoons of the vinaigrette vegetables out the oven a nice spoon of couscous on there our vegetables yup and see the grains of the tuna yeah slice with that on top finally that is a very quick easy healthy tuna okay right off we go yep back to the studio that smells amazing yeah excellent i'm not keen on onions but try it it just actually tastes nice yeah good has it given you a source of inspiration to go and cook yeah i know i can do it now and it's kind of easy once you showed how to do it i'm going to eat all of this just so you know

distinctive lemon flavor it's very lemony isn't it very summery dish isn't it it's like digging oh that is lovely it's good there's a lot more flavors you say coconuts i could almost prefer it and slightly less cooked i like the one with potatoes the salmon's just cooked nicer tastes tastes better i prefer the one without potatoes [Music] it's lighter and it's got better flavors the one with potatoes it's just the fact that the salmon is just cooked to perfection i prefer the one without potatoes all the flavors really complement each other the sauce keeps the salmon a lot more moist can i just say your mushrooms are still in the oven i know i screwed up hi student you know then i had to make a mistake i left the mushrooms in the oven failure what role were they going to play they were only a frill and it's better without the frills okay damn so if you lose you're going to blame your mushrooms right jose what was the score then three two what i don't like it that close but who

hazelnuts um i've never had that in a crumble before how are you um how was your a dessert bit burnt a little bit burnt well it's certainly um yeah caramelised i can clearly identify that you you didn't like that it was a little bit overcooked excellent how was yours i loved it thank god for that man at the table although elderflowers are weak well listen i'm so sorry you found the hell of a week but more importantly i'm happy and enjoy you're so sorry about yours being slightly overcooked right jose results please let's go yes let's go let's get this game the moment of truth right so the number of diners that are happy to pay for the dessert is 36 out of 50. damn why they couldn't really taste the elder flower are they all cold what else and they didn't like the texture it's a crumble

If you liked this clip...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, keeping it simple in the kitchen doesn't mean you can't have amazing food that not only looks incredible but tastes fantastic too my first recipe is so easy it removes the stress from cooking and it's a pleasure to make chili beef lettuce wraps cooking should never be a chore the more you cook the more confident you become that way you actually start to enjoy it and that's the key to good cooking have a bit of fun along the way this is minced beef and minced pork the pork needs to sit in there otherwise the beef's gonna dry out it's really important to season the mince before you cook it pan nice and hot a touch of olive oil [Music] mince in breaking up like that really helps to sort of separate it so we can fry it off with a lot of color with your spoon just go through and start breaking that up the most important thing to remember is mince is made up of cheap cuts brisket belly short rib so it needs help and frying off the mince for color is so important if this pan wasn't hot your mince is going to boil it's a horrible gray color on there and there's no flavor on your mince taste a little bit [Music] tastes delicious it's seasoned beautifully see how crispy it's going take it much further than you ever taken mince before nice and crispy smells incredible i'm draining it it's crucial it keeps the mints nice and crispy let me get rid of that excess fat that's lovely now just wipe out the pan then wash it low gas now we're gonna add texture to the mince finely chopped chili ginger garlic and spring onions spring onions give this sort of mince a really nice freshness because it just gives that crunch nice and thinly now i'm gonna fry off the chilis the ginger the garlic first sesame seed oil teaspoon only in garlic chili ginger in fry that off nicely the sesame seed oil just lifts up the whole flavour brown sugar that starts to really caramelize the chili the garlic and the ginger mince in now my fish sauce that gives it the saltiness you can see now why it's so important to get that mince really crispy because nothing's going soggy staying really crispy fresh lime that makes the mince fragrant and then lime juice roll it and squeeze that in there incredible i've got the salty i've got the heat i've got the sweetness now i've got the acidicness as well and then finally my spring onions in right at the last minute so i've got crunch in there as well smells amazing literally cook the mince now with sort of 30 seconds to go off and take it out [Music] looks incredible smells so inviting [Music] to go with the chili beef i'm making a simple sweet and spicy dipping sauce so everyone can dress the crispy mince to their own taste dipping sauce a little teaspoon the brown sugar soy sauce gives it a nice sort of dark rich color sesame seed oil a tablespoon and just top that up with a tablespoon of olive oil that stops the sesame seed all becoming too rich a teaspoon of fish sauce and then a touch of chili leave the seeds in again i want the heat in that sauce so impressive and amazing show off centerpiece lime juice in in the coriander chop it through once give that little mix up just check the seasoning that's lovely nice and rich now the lettuce i'm going to use baby gem because it's really nice and durable and sort of quite strong so you just sort of sit these nice trimmed lettuce leaves around now the exciting part to serve take your lettuce up spoon in your mince and then a little touch of dressing just a little drizzle nice and that's the secret of having good easy relaxed food is that you just help yourself food that looks and tastes a million bucks doesn't have to be complex this dish is as fun to cook as it is to eat [Music] spicy tuna fish cakes i love this recipe why because it turns this humble ingredient a can of tuna into something delicious just open up and drain the tuna into a sieve just lightly flake that don't press it too hard otherwise you'll dry out the tuna now these are water chestnuts just slice them nice and thin you can buy them anywhere any supermarket chestnuts in fresh ginger get rid of that rough skin on the outside by grating the ginger you get to get all that really nice sort of juice in take your spring onions and just slice on an angle i like the texture of the water chestnut with a spring onion or touch of fresh coriander lovely next remove the seeds from a chili to reduce its heat without losing any flavor and finely chop chili's in kaffir lime leaves roll them up nice and tight run your knife down the center once and just chop and that makes the fish cake nice and fragrant touch of salt a touch of pepper fish sauce just lightly season the tuna to bind all those wonderful ingredients two whole eggs and give that a nice little whisk and then add your eggs get your hands in there and start mixing get the mixture roll it hand to hand and the palm pat them down nicely to cook add a little ground oil to a hot pan at the face of a clock i'm going to go from 12 all the way around first one in these fish cakes only take a few minutes to cook so keeping track of the order they go in the pan means you know which one to turn first [Music] give the pan a nice gentle little shake make sure that nothing's sticking to the bottom spatula two fingers on top turn them over beautiful that crackling noise is something you always want because the tunes are already cooked so we just lightly frying them and get a nice crisp outside and gently take them out smell incredible let them sit there we're gonna make a really nice delicious simple dipping sauce start off a little pinch of sugar fish sauce two tablespoons that gives it the saltiness one tablespoon of rice wine vinegar and some fresh lime juice squeeze all that lime in there your fresh coriander lots of coriander and then give that a little mix and then you have the most amazing spicy tuna fish cakes who would have thought something as delicious as that can come out of a can a simple supper in minutes that's so mouth-wateringly easy and delicious you're guaranteed to cook it again and again green papaya salad this is a great salad to serve at a party it's delicious and robust enough to last the whole evening without wilting first off these are a little dried shrimp you can buy them anywhere they smell almost sort of of the sea bed into the pestilence for this salad inspired by my travels across thailand i'm starting by making a wonderfully spicy paste a little salt in there in just break them up this paste is like a staple ingredient in thailand that's what we're looking for almost it's like a powder right next just one clove of garlic slice up the garlic and get that into the pest and water bird's eye chili incredibly hot powerful but wow it does give an amazing kick to the paste in to the mix now a couple of tablespoons of brown caster sugar that softens the blow with a chilli and then just to give that nice sour taste a little bit of hot water into this tamarind paste it's really tart but sweet paste one tablespoon in fish sauce now it's got that almost sort of pickly smell slightly salty but the flavor is intense two tablespoons in bring that together and give it a really good mix some lime juice in half another touch of tartness the paste is nice and thick and fragrant but it's got the heat the sourness the tartness incredible green papaya stand it up give it a little peel you can find green papaya and local asian shops and bigger supermarkets and as it doesn't work like more delicate veg it's perfect for robust salads like this i grate it look that's what i want these thin slithers next a nice rich sweet banana shalom [Music] nice some carrot carrot gives it another texture now little that and mix it [Music] finish that off with thai basil and fresh coriander thai basil is a much more fragrant basil it's stronger and it's slightly thicker as well like papaya and tamarind paste you can get thai basil in good supermarkets and independent asian stores but normal basil works well too next prepare the crunchy topping pan on and toast some peanuts chop the nuts but it gives a really nice crunch in they go roll them around the pan gas off and just stick them out now for the exciting part i'm going to dress the salad nice spoon of dressing in to the papaya mix that in and then finally a nice general sprinkling roasted nuts and that is one delicious very fragrant very robust green papaya salad so easy to make and guaranteed not to go limp a perfect party salad and with such incredible colors textures and bold exciting flavors it's sure to grab your guests attention for me the secret of a great brunch is fun and casual fuss-free cooking and everyone helping themselves this is the ultimate steak sandwich you want the rolls royce of beef it has to be fillet now season it beautifully i like to open up the top of the peppermill to increase the size of the pepper in the steak so it gives that bit of heat nice little chunks you just roll now nicely all the way around now slice the garlic in half pan nice and hot olive oil in [Music] hold the steak and just place it into the pan don't drop it at the front of the pan we're going to tilt the pan forward to cook the back of the steak dual purpose now roll it back and sear underneath next my garlic and roast that garlic thyme fry that time i want to hear it we're not looking for a lot of color because you're going to dry out the fill it so just one end turn it back down and steer the other end in lift up your time place it on top of the garlic there lift up your fillet and sit that on top of your garlic butter in take a spoon tilt the pan gently lift up and baste i've got that scented garlic thyme flavour the steak is going to cook evenly because it's sat on a little a little bed in the oven for 8 to 10 minutes [Music] pan on for the relish you think of a steak sandwich you think of a sort of nice heated tomato relish to make the relish finely dice a red onion three finger rule one in front two behind through and chop wow next roughly chop a chilli keeping the seeds in for extra heat start off with the olive oil into a pan onions chili [Music] generous with the olive oil i want a nice sort of rich silky relish from there take your tomatoes you can't just use red tomatoes but these yellow and red make the perfect combination now put your salt in and then roast those tomatoes off take a wooden spoon and just sort of break them up once the skins blister the whole tomato just starts to release all that really nice sweet texture a little teaspoon of cherry vinegar gives that nice acidic balance the sweetness of the tomatoes turn down the gas and just let them sort of stew perfectly now a steak sandwich would not be complete unless it had the most amazing mustard mayonnaise simply add three tablespoons of mayonnaise to three teaspoons of whole grain mustard now i've got the reddish almost down to like a really nice jam now i want to make that reddish a little bit more fragrant some basil slice it through sprinkle that basil in there [Music] beautiful look at this she is my crown jewels time to take it out smell is incredible just based one more time fill it touch is quite soft in the center so it's just coming up to mid-rare let it rest at the same time you cooked it it'll be nice and pink evenly throughout the steak to make my sandwich i'm going to char grill some sliced chipatta bread season it nicely just a little drizzle of olive oil i want to get that bread nice and crispy pan nice and hot bread in push it down smell is amazing that char sort of charcoal flavor once you've got those marks on the bread it just stops the bread from becoming soggy and look at this here it is stunning on slice it gently one beautiful slice wow it's nice and pink all the way through and the beef is so soft it's almost like slicing through butter let the knife do the work [Music] little bit of mayonnaise spread that the back of the spoon on both sides next lettuce take that beautiful slice of beef and then relish on top of that beef and just slice the sandwich in half beautiful now that's what i call a steak sandwich trust me serve the sublime sandwich for brunch and you'll put a smile on everyone's face you

If you liked this clip check...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, starting out as a young chef my biggest influence was definitely french cuisine and when i was 23 years of age i was determined to learn as much as i could so i set off for paris to work in some of the most demanding and exacting kitchens in the world and my passion and love for french food really took hold when i was living in france i got to know two very distinct traditions of french food on the one hand there was the delicious oil cuisine i cooked all day in the restaurant and on the other hand there was the food you ate in people's homes which is a lot simpler to make but still absolutely delicious my ultimate french-inspired lunch is very light bright and really takes me back to when i lived in paris it's my take on the salad nicoise serve with a delicious goat's cheese and pear tartine think of the nicoise as an assembly job of delicious ingredients brought together with a fantastic dressing the secret behind my salad nicoise is in the dressing room spoon dijon mustard into a pestle and mortar some people top the salad with anchovies and capers but in mine they're the base to the dressing we're gonna grind that to a paste and then get the garlic in there season well with black pepper it doesn't need any salt in there because of the anchovies add a couple of tablespoons of red wine vinegar olive oil and lastly flat leaf parsley to give the dressing freshness against those deep flavors it's a thick rich substantial dressing dressing done now for the salad ball potatoes green beans and eggs from a rolling ball seven and a half to eight minutes it should keep that nice yolky creamy texture in the center once the eggs are ready put them into cold water to stop them cooking and this is a great trick to peel them so much easier peeling eggs when you use the water that they've been cooling down in and the water will seep underneath all the shell so the whole shell just gets peeled off of one beautiful big layer now beans nice and crunchy season the beans and potatoes whilst they're still warm so they absorb more flavor a little drizzle of olive oil salt pepper and just let them sit there whilst the potatoes and beans cool down i'm doing a simple french open sandwich which is called a tartine this is delicious first i'm toasting baguette on the griddle lightly oil your griddle pan get your bread stick it on there take a pear it goes brilliantly well with goat's cheese slice the pear into finger width pieces that's the color we're looking for that dark crispy texture now for the ghost cheese give it a season it doesn't need salt because a little fresh goat cheese is already quite salty then a handful of crumbled walnuts they go under the grill whilst they put the tuna and these ones together my secret to assembling a great nisswa salad is to start in the middle of the plate and add ingredients layer by layer there's one thing i'm always missing the bottom of salad is dressing so i like to put it on the plate first baby gem lettuce is great because it's robust and holds that heavy dressing then add firm waxy salad potatoes and green beans i like them to have a bit of a crunch canned tuna can be fantastic i'm using a good quality one in olive oil which has been drained next baby plum tomatoes which have a lovely intense sweet flavor and then my eggs that nice dark rich yolk beautiful yolk's still creamy inside he's a little olive nicoise this will work just as well with other black olives and then your dressing drizzle that round gently beautiful that is a nicoise in heaven now tartine wow just a smell of those grilled walnuts that is beautiful a simple but very elegant tuna nicoise with a delicious ghost cheese sandwich wonderful [Music] my vibrant and gutsy nisswa salad with that incredible anchovy and caper dressing served with a pear and goat's cheese tartine too good to let the french keep all to themselves [Music] tilly would you mind helping daddy with the chicken fricassee please we're gonna start off with browning all the chicken off nicely pan on get that nice and hot what i want you to do for me first is to season the chicken with salt and pepper please thank you so that's on one side then we turn the chicken over so we season it on the other side salt good girl and pepper nice now this is almost like a chicken stew okay what's that there [Music] time time good girl what's that one there that one that's right rosemary and because this is quite a rustic french dish we don't need to chop everything so you get the garlic and you just bash it like that now smell mmm that's right so that's nice and hot put a tablespoon of olive oil in there a couple of lugs one two good girl put the chicken in it and you lay away you're like nice and brown i'm getting good at this you are skin side down so we got the color on the skin now just want you to cut the mushrooms in half the belly please okay these are chestnut mushrooms there are lots of different kinds of mushrooms out there there are lots and lots of different types of mushrooms which one's your favorite one of my favorites is the giro mushroom i like mushrooms that are a bit bigger than this and um some dinners with mum we cut out the middle put pesto and cheese in it and then we bake them uh-uh i want you to sprinkle the pancetta over the chicken please good girl nice mushrooms not yet because i'm gonna get some color on the chicken first okay and as that pancetta starts to cook down it puts a really nice flavor on the chicken yeah so we're sort of sauteing everything okay all right garlic in please good girl just throw them in and i want you to sprinkle the mushrooms on top of that good girl and then there's the rosemary you can get your fingers like that and you pull it down you take it all off hold it put it down good girl so now you've got the nice little rosemary sprigs and we do the same with the thyme now the time flower is a little bit smaller what different flavors do they give so the time is a little bit sweeter okay and the rosemary a little bit more savoury which one do you like i like them both because they both get a nice smell don't they so they leaf in i'd like you to put that rosemary and thyme in there please lovely sprinkle it over right i'd like you to stand back now because i'm gonna flambe this i do not want to get those little slippers caught on fire what are the names rumpel and judy julia nice okay great ready yeah in with a brandy and then just tilt the pan gently whoa whoa how cool is that magical beautiful bit like a cauldron all the cognac has been flambe so there's no raw alcohol anywhere so we've got a really nice deep rich flavor i'm gonna add my chicken stock you know rampo likes that not my slipper rumple run for the dog ah rumple the dog well he likes chicken stock yes when he's a good boy he gets um he gets it in his um with his biscuit it's gone in like wow really quickly simmer and reduce the stock for around 10 minutes now we're going to cook the most amazing potatoes soda potatoes are really simple to make and absolutely delicious start by slicing the potatoes into finger whipped pieces then parboil them for five to six minutes when you cook something like rosemary or thyme or basil does it slowly let off the flavor into the bottle very much so in a hot pan add a tablespoon of goose fat and saute the potatoes until they turn golden and add in shallots garlic rosemary and thyme that goes in over top and that goose fat now is starting to fry the potatoes you just leave that sat there to complete my ultimate french dinner my version of a classic a glorious lavender creme caramel for dessert the first job is the lavender sugar you can buy this ready-made or simply add dried edible sprigs of lavender to caster sugar and store you can also try this trick with vanilla pods and cinnamon to bring new subtle flavors to sweets and bacon [Music] for the creme caramel melt plain caster sugar until it turns dark golden pour into ramekins sprinkle with lavender flowers and cool now to make a simple custard gently heat whole milk in a pan until steaming meanwhile whisk together egg vanilla seeds and lavender sugar until golden and fluffy then gradually pour the hot milk into the mix whisking continuously until the custard is smooth and creamy to set cook in a water bath or bamboo a good tip is to line a roasting tin with a cloth to stop the ramekins jiggling around pour your custard then boiling water around the ramekins until halfway up the sides then cook in a preheated oven for around 30 minutes until set cool in the fridge then when you're ready to serve dip the ramekins in hot water to loosen the creme caramel [Music] ebola lavender clean caramel [Music] look at that chicken now so i'm just going to turn the gas right down and put the lid on just like that but leave a little bit so it can net out some stuff so i can let out some steam that's right now what i'd like to do is to chop daddy some parsley crunch it up nicely tuck your fingers in and take your time [Music] now my hands have got lots of different flavors all those wonderful flavors you could almost be french sprinkle that on there good girl nice messy buckle nice now potato chicken i can tell jack's gonna love this is he looks delish doesn't it smells i delicious smell that even before you took the lid off let's get on my darling good job by the way thank you i can't wait for the others to try it i hope they love it this is my ultimate french dinner chicken fricassee with sensational herbie sauty potatoes and lavender creme caramel

the germans pasta it's light it's fluffy but more importantly it's got to be crispy season hot pan olive oil as it hits the pan it puffs up it's nice and light [Applause] [Music] [Applause] butter strong enough that has to be the perfect strong enough smoked paprika chicken stroganoff bit specially done look at that chicken it's [ __ ] black which one that one there oh dear ah [Music] what's the matter we're burning the aliens no no no no no no hey would you serve that no don't wait would you throw that no no [ __ ] huh come on guys very nice sean make sure they're all even yes big chef yeah good there you go we've got the heat back okay awfully well [Music] right now got the heat back in the pan okay we start losing the heat we'll boil the chicken with all the chicken there's no flavor right next on the menu a bit of monkey business i've come to london zoo to meet hannah to tell her to stop monkeying around when it comes to her diet hannah has worked here as zookeeper and animal nutritionist for the past four years my job here is mostly to look after the um the primates so all the monkeys and the apes good morning yes each day hannah prepares peanuts and meal worms for the squirrel monkeys the chimps get fresh papaya the mama sets banana and bobby the silverback griller enjoys a sumptuous spread of seeds fennel and curly kale like most of her charges hannah doesn't eat meat but she's not looking after herself half as well as the monkeys and it's beginning to show i've recently got a gluten and dairy intolerance so every day at work i basically have the same thing it's either gluten-free pasta with pesto or a baked potato pasta and baked potatoes every day hannah's clearly not getting enough variety in her restricted diet and i think her main problem is lack of protein hannah good morning how are you i'm very well thank you it's like a blown up version of anti-roll thompson the diet is crucial yes absolutely vegetable intake vitamin c you know protein yeah and that balance is the most important part yeah absolutely when was the last time you sat down to a really good piece of meat uh a good good three three and a half years ago any reason i think having started at the zoo you kind of start to get a different outlook on on the on how animals are treated the sort of meat that you eat i've always been i was always careful about what meat i ate before so you would eat meat if it was you know yeah probably uh red organic absolutely bobby the silverback griller is a great example of what a healthy balanced diet can do for you bobby there we go he's having his he's having his fruit tea now fruit tea i'm surprised he's not my earl grey it's lunch time for bobby and the other animals so hannah and i are off to make it right this is our cutting up room it's like a prep room for a restaurant you've got the frizzy lettuce cabbage cardamom lemon peel allspice this is a joke isn't it avocados we're serving avocados as well no it's good for them it's very you know obviously it's essential fatty acid and would you like it turned into we do make guacamole yeah you make guacamole film as well and avocado prawns avocado crab or spinach chicory fricassee iceberg fennel spinach broccoli we've got michelin-starred monkeys i'm i'm stuck here you are yes not looking after yourself man the grillers are getting baby gym lettuce absolutely you're smart man are you um baby gem lettuce no one is a [ __ ] shortage for the restaurants i'm going to cook hannah a deliciously healthy dish using the same ingredients she feeds bobby the gourmet griller with no dairy or gluten just to show you that all the stuff you're working with down there yeah it can be equally exciting for you first up coleslaw don't lose any nutrients through cooking raw is more celeriac carrots and cabbage are all packed with vitamins and fiber and give the dish a delicious crunch i love the smoky bitterness of chicory and it's very low in cholesterol i'm gonna make a quick vinaigrette so two thirds olive oil one third sesame seed oil yeah a little bit of mustard okay poppy seeds just a tablespoon makes a great contribution to your daily calcium needs lemon juice and parsley help the digestion of proteins and fats they also taste great and then uh vinegar within three or four minutes the seasoning is going to start breaking down the coleslaw and now for my wild card hannah's fed up with her unbalanced boring gluten-free diet she may not have eaten meat for three years but now she thinks she's ready to give it another go so i'm phoning at the deep end with a delicious protein-rich steak um this is the kind of beef it's reared um in airshow yeah it's fed on grass in the summer uh swedes and turnip in the winter so it's a proper organic beef when i did eat meat i would try and eat organic i don't like the way the animals are mass produced no i stand strong on that one nor do i how do you like your beef how do you like it cooked medium yeah yeah fine so we'll cook it remember okay for the dressing shallot i believe that good quality lean meat is a key part of a healthy diet so i'm hoping this dish will help hannah back on the road to recovery turn over the steaks a delicious tarragon dressing should make her first fill it's taking years a little easier to deal with so it's quite a spicy marinade target we just cut once slightly faster give it a stir and add to the steaks delicious what we're going to do is spoon that over so as the beef starts to cool down it absorbs all that amazing flavor finally finish the coastal with coriander and it's ready to go [Music] i can't believe you can put so much different flavors and taste just into coleslaw i haven't quite i managed to uh take on the beef you put the most amazing energy into looking after these animals so you need protein yeah absolutely a good bit of salmon do you think something someone worked perfectly just not quite ready for the uh for the red meat don't you worry about that i'll use it all right what's the matter we have quite some complaints over the uh saltiness in the dishes complaints about what sauce do my sauce hey guys the dining room were complaining about the seasoning i haven't done any seasoning but we aren't putting any i haven't touched a little bit you haven't cut the salt no when you see the spatula how are you seizing that small amounts no nothing at all nothing at all i i promise you nothing okay okay let's go how about thank you sean make sure it's spotless yeah sure yes [Music] biggins you're eating and the [ __ ] customers aren't i

favorite foods to eat what do you enjoy most i adore oysters how important is it with an oyster that it has the the juice still in it it's crucial and i never eat an oyster unless it's stuck to the shell when they're released and they're put back in it could be from a different shell so you need it seriously you think someone would do that well sometimes they do they clean the shelves they put it in the dishwasher and then they get the oysters from other shelves and stick them in there no criminal mastermind would do something like that hold that thought i've got a very special treat for you all right come with me oh okay yeah you're a big fan of oysters yeah look what i've got for you okay he was acquitted on all charges remember and then he should be allowed to perform again i hear

oh okay and you get them there and just sit them in the tin foil and it keeps the oyster up it doesn't lose its juice you know what i'd normally do though is i put some crushed ice on the plate is that is that the time you've opened [ __ ] three well at my speed yeah yeah we're gonna have a shock off yeah okay we've heard you can guess the winner of this how many are we trying to get through we're gonna get through the whole train together ready steady steady go go go twist low down away in in twist and twist up keeping all the juice in where's that gone in i mean twist i'm not popping

chicken or the veg um no the veg are you playing yes i am playing and five of you aren't right you are personal that's very generous it was still very very well i'm so sorry it was salty thank you these are patients thank you very much the stroganoff was very good chicken was really soft um you could really taste the smokiness of the paprika and the sauce was very rich it was a really lovely dish right results may cause okay the amount of guests that paid yeah out of 50 is oh jesus jesus i can't even call that out 17. that is the worst we've ever had no really guys i'm here for perfection and that is shocking what do they say well the majority over salty so salty yeah can we come back for dessert yes coming up after eight weeks in the making i finally get to neck a bottle of my home brew it's extraordinary next one my very own beer and it's time for janet to say goodbye to david and elton [Music] [Applause] right it's recipe challenge time jessica hines is taking me on with her macaroni and cheese yes first of all good to see you tell me about macaroni and cheese macaroni cheese start with macaroni yes it's a form of pasta yeah because you didn't know that it's like a pasta okay now why have you chosen cheese because it's delicious it's easy to cook my kids love it i feel quite confident cooking it now you know the blind tasters aren't children today don't you this is actually slightly more adult version and what makes it an adult version well it's put onion in it onion grated onions so if you don't like that you might not like it yes so just making macaroni and cheese of course i'm gonna do macaroni and cheese this one's gonna be done with um wonderful juror mushrooms so a bit of a wild mushroom thing going on are you gonna do any work today or are you gonna listen this is just you know i'm chilling here i'm just looking we're just watching you that you have lots of children so normally i'd be going no stop it what uh come here come here that's why it's a good recipe you're just boiling the macaroni cheese there you grew up in a bit of a sort of hippie household what kind of things did you eat lots of lentils and yogurt right lentils and yogurt my mum used to make bread well you're not vegetarian are you i was a vegetarian after my son was born i just went off eating meat actually oh really welcome back and uh no i got pregnant with my with my daughter yeah and i didn't even know i was pregnant i was two weeks pregnant and i was at barbecue and there was a big plate of spare ribs and i would have eaten the person yeah standing in front of the spare ribs if that's what it took to get to them i didn't know i was pregnant at the time amazing and then when i saw the spare ribs yeah my intense desire for serums made me think i'm pregnant i must be pregnant oh sure they're amazing yeah macaroni is hard cooked and then i'm just going to glaze the pan touch the white wine and start making a really nice white wine cream sauce my white sauce is is basically like anybody else's white sauce which is just melt the butter put the flour in stir it up and then i add for this not too much but just a couple of pinches of jerk seasoning which is kind of caribbean seasoning no flour in my white sauce just cream shallots and thyme and girals wow bring it up to the boil and then i'm going to thicken it with this amazing cheese i'm using stitching cheese which is quite sort of rich and very um slightly salty but absolutely delicious perfect for macaroni and cheese so how did you start off in comedy how did you get into it well i am i i was always being picked for comic rolls we had a couple of teachers they used to write us these little sort of um plays so i just kind of thought maybe i didn't do this there's a lot less female comedians than there are male comedians why is that i think it's more important for them to think they're funny so yeah which is weird no yeah i think it's because men just think they're funny jess you know that that's true too you know in terms of that level of arrogance maybe women aren't as funny as men i don't think that i know i'm wondering maybe that's why no okay so cream has reduced down now to this really nice mushroom creamy sauce season it with chives and then egg yolks in that will help it sort of glaze in the oven as it bakes parmesan cheese then we're going to add the macaroni back in to the cream bake and then win i've just made a white sauce nice and slowly and now i'm um grating red onion so the onion is going raw you can sweat the onion off very quickly if you wish to sweat it oh you're gonna put it sweat when it cooks and that's the point the point is you want a little bit of the onion right you don't want onion oh onion and then finally where's the in a macaroni now grated cheese on the top that's it finito i'm gonna win right so they're both in the oven now tomorrow where do i put it at the top i would like it to go there okay no actually where are you gonna put yours oh i'm just asking he's coming out you ladies first you go first where are you putting yours hey i want to put mine in there too can i both go there of course i can okay of course good luck you are so competitive you know that huh right it's time to bottle my special f-word beer two months ago i set off on a mission to find and brew a beer that would complement janice reporter's veal it's a very mellow creamy rich beer that is delicious that i could then brew my own back garden super sweet great that is incredible you know we've got some nice hooks we'll get a lovely smooth creamy flavor to the beer that's like a witch's potion when you stir it a witch's potion excuse me hey this is your dad's very own beer i thought this [ __ ] works [ __ ] it nine days later the brew was ready to be transferred into an oak bourbon barrel where it spent several weeks absorbing the barrel's unique caramel flavor the barrel this is where all the flavor comes from so we're going to put the beer in here for 30 days and it's going to transform it add a lot of oak character a little bit of vanilla we just need to pump it into the barrel now yeah so i've brought these staves just to show you this is a part of an oak barrel right right it's been used for bourbon yeah before they fill it with bourbon they char it they fire the inside incredible and that's why you've got this black coloration it's charcoal surely would make the bear darker though no no it doesn't make the beer darker it actually takes a bit of color and you can see this layer here it's where the bourbon has previously soaked into and it's changed the flavor of the wood in there so that now when our beer's going in here yeah that flavor that's in there comes leaching out and goes into the beer and that's where we get the sort of vanilla the creamy character of this beer ah to get it all canny scottish trick there come on get it only scotland get that one right down to the last four the smell is amazing it's sort of biscuity creamy flavor unbelievable i mean it's just getting better and better and better this is going to really change things really transform it there we go two months later the beer is ready to be bottled and drunk a house protana has had to put up with a lot over the years and has drawn the line of me building a beer bottling plant in the garage so dougal and i wait out a view of my house to meet a man with a mobile bottling solution so this guy yes got a bottling line on the back of this lorry so this thing's mobile travels around the country bottling beer yeah unbelievable oh my god i can spot the barrel bloody hell this mobile bottling unit will cool and filter the beer removing any remaining yeast and then carbonating it to give it a light fizz my first ever bottle homemade brew it needs to be perfect it's too late to start over oh it's [ __ ] delicious brewing my beer in the whiskey soaked oak barrel has really paid off extraordinary next one my very own beard the flavor will work brilliantly with janet's veal so the exciting thing now will be coming up with a veal dish that can match that you got something to be said yeah absolutely

anything seriously unreal sean lovely absolutely spot on help over here mint and wipe the plates please chris good to see you're busy [ __ ] too many cooks for the brother that's right yes meanwhile chris is busting his ass unfucking real go well done except biggians huh well done gang right back to dennis street porter and trust me this one is not for the squeamish david and elton janet's two veal calves are about to be slaughtered but jan is not sure she can bear to see them killed i just don't want to watch you shooting them all slit in their throat unfortunately i just don't think i could you ever have farmers who can't face watching it at all no david's time's up first and as he's led into the stunning box janet has a change of heart and decides she wants to stay with him to the end she's been to abattoirs before but never to see the slaughter of animals she's reared personally the slaughter of cattle in the uk is governed by strict guidelines and can only be carried out by licensed slaughtermen like martin mcintyre he'll ensure the animals have caused minimal stress and make the kill as quick as possible okay yeah fine [Music] the captive bolt renders david heavily stunned from this point he won't feel anything the blood's drained from the body before they process the carcass you okay the stunning was fine the blood split and i could do without if it starts to twitch it's just nerves now it's time for janet's second calf [Music] elton [Music] now the cards are gutted the parts of the cards that can be eaten are separated from those that can't do you want them what bollocks testicles no it's okay it's only got one napkin oh which one only have one [ __ ] elton david so you'd only have one ball yeah oh that's disgusting the lungs are windpipe very healthy obviously it wasn't a smoker janet's time as a farmer is over and it's time for the veal to be prepared the cars will be hung for up to 10 days to improve the flavour before dave is enjoyed by janet's friends in north yorkshire and elton's delivered to the f word [Music] [Applause] [Music] restaurant fine thank you you're looking very countrified do you knit that no i [ __ ] didn't miss it at all okay it's a designer item jesus christ now alton and david are officially they're dead go on best slaughtered and i saw before i went to the slaughterhouse i didn't think that i could even go in the building i hope to change your mind i was persuaded by the slaughterhouse itself because it's a very small uh family business it's in the middle of the yorkshire dales and quite honestly if animals are going to be sorted that's the way to do it personal it was personal and it seemed to be part of the environment do you have any second thoughts about not sending them and actually pulling one back and saying hold on get out no because gordon they were never pets they were always reared to make a point about field though the carcasses look magnificent yes they look really good the animal inspector said they were top quality me it's made me want all of me the ie to have had a decent life and i just don't know how anyone watching this program can quite frankly go and buy cheap nasty meat you just you think you know you owe it to yourself and you owe it to animals to make sure that you know where that meat came from and how it was one last thing just yeah a little present from me something to sort of remember them by enough just for you for your kitchen wall above the argo oh that's lovely isn't that nice yeah good luck is the dribble that's what i will remember [Applause] coming up i find out if i'm still the big cheese in the macaroni recipe challenge well they did like both okay come on [Applause] right time for the blind tasers to taste both macaroni and

result yes if you want a job next week good luck yes good luck you're gonna need it hello so here we have our first and the second dish lovely enjoy quite salty the the cheese is quite strong it's got quite a strong flavor that comes through i quite like the the fact that the pasta's not not too overdone this is still quite quite firm really enjoying that it looks great this one yeah i really like

Gordon Ramsay's Ultimate Fit Food/Healthy, Lean and Fit – http://po.st/REpVfP...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, mushrooms are one of my all-time favorite ingredients i use chestnut mushrooms with the beef short ribs because i love their firm texture and nutty taste but there's a huge range of other mushrooms that are great for slow cooked dishes and when it comes to buying them there's one expert green grocer who's a fountain of knowledge borough marcus fred foster he started off on the memphis dead still in pimlico really he had a salad stall with other 20 years of experience he could actually write his own mushroom encyclopedia mushrooms as soon as you pick them the moisture starts coming out of them so you need to buy them when they're fresh certain products you smell for flavour and they tend to be fruits mushrooms don't smell nice at all they smell kind of metallic really so you have to use your eyes as your guide of what you buy with mushrooms really really important wild mushrooms are literally grown wild in the forest they're just quality wherever they are this is morel mushroom a fantastic product so hard to find in the world it's almost got an apricoty type of flavour earthy woody and of course as you cook it the flavour increases for extra flavor and texture highly prized morels are ideal when added to slow cooked stews and casseroles as are the trumpet de la more which have a deliciously rich flavor another wild type to try is the chanterelle its subtle fruity flavor is delicious and perfect fried with butter parsley and garlic when you're dealing with wild mushrooms you need to clean them it can be quite a slow process it's with a soft brush don't don't use water never use water with mushrooms it deteriorates the mushroom rapidly oyster mushrooms are very meaty mushroom just a lovely silky smooth flavour really nice how do you tell whether it's fresh those gills are bright never cut an oyster mushroom always tear it look at the whiteness of that beautiful that would be grey if it was old although also found wild oyster mushrooms are more commonly cultivated along with a similar type the enoki their delicate taste is great in salads and soups finally fred saved the best until last and of course the pinnacle is the truffle they are really really sought after the smell is so intense that smell it's hard to describe because it's such a unique smell the more expensive the truffle the more intense the smell so that's why you use such a small amount on a dish it's amazing the way they get these they used to use pigs of course they don't do that anymore they use dog steel but because the pigs used to eat them all this magical tasting fungi is by weight one of the most expensive foods in the world it's phenomenal eaten raw shaved over pastel or risottos or drizzle of truffle or turn slow cooked stews into something out of this world people are actually scared of mushrooms aren't they so it's amazing really they shouldn't be because take away the fear and just close your eyes and taste them they're just amazing they are amazing [Music] slow cooking is a brilliant way of getting lots of extra depth and intensity into your dishes the secret is to lock in all those flavors at the start and let the ingredients do their thing as it cooks these are beef short ribs and there's basically five to six bones across there and as the short rib cooks it sticks that bone the bone implants flavor and the meat just sort of melts cooks slowly gives it that nice level intensity slice alongside the bone straight down you can see that marbling that sort of disappears and disintegrates i'm cooking them in a roasting tray get it on the heat until nice and hot season these short ribs beautifully olive oil in bone on the top we'll start coloring that in [Music] really important to give the beef short ribs a really nice sear if you didn't brown the meat off it goes in the oven and it looks like boiled meat so you really want that nice dark rich coloring just cut the garlic in half slide that down the side that's going to give that beef an amazing flavor [Music] to give body to the sauce stir in a heaped teaspoon of tomato puree i'm just hitting the bottom of the pan with that tomato puree and we call it cooking out that smell of puree otherwise it just goes in there raw and it gives this sort of tartness to the braised short ribs red wine in don't use an expensive bottle of red wine there's no need bring the wine up to the boil and reduce it this burns off the alcohol and concentrates the flavor makes a big difference when you reduce the red wine down by half because it gives that nice dark rich intensity look at my garlic that is just gonna sweeten everything up incredible stock in beef stock perfect chicken stock fine just to about an inch underneath the beef short ribs bring it up to the ball to lock in all that flavor as the beef ribs slow cook cover them so they braised from the bottom and steamed from the top into the oven two and a half hours 170 to 180 degrees in she goes the great thing about slow cooking is you do most of the work in advance and then put your feet up five or ten minutes before the beef short ribs come out of the oven start your garnish this is light cured pancetta we want nice thick nice big thick sticks of crispy bacon [Music] these are delicious chestnut mushrooms i'm not going to slice them i'm just going to cut them in half but look at the color on those lardons now all the whites raw fat have disappeared the lardons have shrunk right down and all we've got there now is the proper bacon mushrooms in beautiful so the mushrooms get seasoned from the bacon i'm pan frying these separately to the beef so they remain crisp and have a different texture [Music] leave that to cool down now this is like christmas day for me when you unwrap that fall once you see what's underneath it [Music] wow they smell incredible lift and place on your tray beautiful to make a fantastic rich deep sauce press the soft roasted garlic through a sieve into the cooking juices all that nice pureed garlic coming through there because that is going to make the most amazing flavor scrape all of that off the sieve nice then just start sieving all that lovely brazing liquor in that smells delicious take your sauce and just glaze do them individually they deserve that respect spoon on your bacon and your mushrooms beautiful be generous with these mushrooms i'm telling you they taste amazing flat leaf parsley all that freshness over those amazing ribs incredible never ever be embarrassed about going to your butcher and asking for cheap cuts because the results are incredible amazing beef braised short ribs with bacon and mushrooms it's mushroom and leek pasta this fantastic fast and simple pasta dish made with everyday ingredients just goes to prove you can eat good food whenever you want really important put the water on first so you can just have it gently swimming away ready for the pasta while the water comes to the boil start the sauce by slicing mushrooms first off fingers one in front two behind up and down then add olive oil to a hot frying pan [Music] i want that nice color on the mushrooms off the heat literally 10 seconds and when you toss something really important you get all the ingredients at the end of the pan push down and pull back that noise that's that's all the water coming out of the mushrooms next finely chop a fat clove of garlic [Music] then prepare your leeks just take your knife and go down through the center turn it over and again into quarters see all that opening up and then just rinse the top of that to get rid of any potential dirt or sand it just breaks up into nice little quarters add all that leek into those mushrooms beautiful and now the secret is to get rid of that water inside the leek as it cooks down all the water's gone you just left that really nice intense flavor garlic's got nice and crispy now we're going to add a touch of chicken stock in there beautiful lasagna sheets i'm just going to drop the sheets in to the water lasagna sheets are an unusual choice for a dish like this but they work brilliantly although any type of pasta you've got in the cupboard will do and just twist that pan that stops any pasta actually sticking to the bottom of the pan chicken start to reduce down by half and it's almost delays the bottom of the pan basically washed all that wonderful flavor off turn the gas down and add a couple of tablespoons of cream this just enriches the dish bring it back up to the bowl and let it simmer for three to four minutes now the secret with the pasta is just taking it out a little early so you've got that nice texture hold up the sheet and just nip it and you can feel your fingers in the center it's ready turn the sauce down and lay these beautiful sheets of lasagna into that sauce i'm just going to turn the gas off now and let the pasta sit in there and absorb that amazing sauce finish with chopped fresh tarragon it's a delicious herb it goes brilliantly well mushrooms and leeks just let that sit and almost sort of infuse to serve i'm making a quick bruschetta by toasting fresh chipata bread two nice slices drizzle that in olive oil a little bit of garlic just rub the bread the crust as well crust is what really takes that garlic now pan for the bread little touch of olive oil as it starts to smoke bread in [Music] but look at the pasta now it's been stained by that amazing sauce to serve i want a nice spoon of my mushrooms leeks and cream then i'll take my pasta just twist it and let it sit on top that tarragon has just lifted everything bread on and that's the beauty about something so simple they can be done in 20

If you liked this clip check...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, today i'm taking my queue from italy a country that takes home cooking family and fresh vibrant flavors extremely seriously the italians are brilliantly using good food to bring people together as well as being delicious today's dishes are also really quick and easy to make leaving you more time to sit down and enjoy them with your friends and family fennel sausage frittata [Music] the exciting thing about frittata is the fact there's no set recipe because it's basically eggs whatever else you have left for me the secret of a good frittata is in the sausage nice hot pan onions in general from the onions heat nice and high season fennel seeds to give the onions a really nice flavor everyone's used to cooking sausages whole but it's a really nice way of using them to take them out of their thin skin what we're going to do is crumple all that wonderful spicy fennel sausage into the onions it's going to release all that flavor a lot quicker pretty important to keep that gas nice and high and the longer you can rise the sausage the more flavor you're gonna gain six whole eggs give your eggs a really good mix flat leaf parsley a staple in italian cooking chop it quite rough some parmesan it gives a really nice seasoning fresh pepper a little touch of salt and then get it in there when you fork through it so when you slice it no one's complaining they've got less sausage gonna make it even more italian by topping it with some buffalo mozzarella dry it and then slice it nice and thinly twist it mozzarella in and then finally finish it with pans and cheese get the top just as tasty as it is the bottom my frittata needs three and a half to four minutes under a red hot grill to achieve the best results always ensure your oven or grill are preheated to the perfect temperature she's ready this is the thing i love about italian cooking it's about sharing but always focusing on the ingredients look at that i mean it's incredible a little shake the pan to make sure it comes out and then spatula underneath and just leave it it's light fluffy and it smells incredible and that for me is a dream come true it's amazing how far you can take six eggs and two sausages wow spicy fennel sausage frittata my ultimate italian breakfast it's a cracking start to the day for my ultimate italian lunch i'm cooking scrummy sardines topped with a fragrant gremolata dressing but first a deliciously fresh orzo pasta salad this is one of the hidden delicacies of italian pasta also because 90 of the time it's always hidden in a soup or broth or minestrone and it looks like large grains of rice but once they absorb that water they double in size it's a pasta that needs a lot of help season it nicely a pinch of salt and splash of extra virgin olive oil fresh bay leaf into the boiling water and that bay leaf really helps to flavor the pasta give it a little pan a turn left and right that stops any pasta sticking to the bottom and the secret behind cooking any pasta is having a nice gentle rolling boil you just have the gas up where the outside of the pan is just rolling and all that also is tumbling over each other gently boiling pasta rapidly tends to destroy the outside texture it doesn't take the marinade or the vinaigrette or the sauce for the dressing parmesan twist of fresh pepper the zest of the lemon squeeze your lemon in there through your fingers to catch all those seeds bring that together with some extra virgin olive oil pine nuts taste delicious toasting them just elevates them after eight minutes my orzo is perfectly al dente drain it a little bit of cold water through it flows the cooking process down but stops it from going mushy it's the size of pumpkin seeds now a drizzle of olive oil and into the vinaigrette whilst it's still warm just above room temperature because the warmer the pasta the more it absorbs the vinaigrette and now some texture rocket not finely chopped and the fresh basil as well roll them up like a big fat cigar slice in half and then chop the basil for crunch just sprinkle the toasted pine nuts it looks like a plate of jewels glistens is a delicious very fragrant orzo pasta salad now the sardines incredibly healthy and absolutely delicious grilled never ever be intimidated on looking for fresh fish it's about the condition of the fish bright eyes fresh gills nice bright red interior and the firmness of the flesh almost you could stand the fish up on its own it needs to be that fresh the best way to get flavour into a sardine is to grill it light seasoning olive oil and just roll the seasoning around get your rosemary peel off a few of the little shards at the end so it's a little bit sharp push the rosemary in almost like you're threading makes them so much more flavoursome they'll be scared those fine little bones i remember growing up with sardines tin sardines you didn't turn your nose up at the bone once the griddle pan starts to smoke lightly drizzle and then sardines on two and a half to three minutes each side now for the gremolata a vinaigrette that sits beautifully well on the sardines freshly parsley just run the knife once there's nothing worse when you overchop parsley and all that delicious flavors let on the board the zest and juice of an orange and the lemon i'm gonna turn them now gremolata is about fragrance natural flavors brilliant for grilled meats as well little touch of salt and pepper and then olive oil just to bring it together the garlic i almost want to be like a secret weapon in there rate it bring that together you've got a very fresh clean gremolata almost if we're sat on the amalfi coast off and then whilst the sardines are still nice and warm and just thinly coat the gremolata i'd like the path in the garlic to sit on top and that's citrus from the lemon and the orange to sort of dive underneath you can see why italian cuisine rides on the freshest and the simplest execution they allow their ingredients to become the hero not the chef also salad we're stunning grilled sardines wherever you eat this dish it will fill your senses with the sun and the sea of the mediterranean delicious [Music] we're hoping to wow the family with an amazing quick fig jam crostini with creamy barata and the heart in maine are beef cheek ragu with poplar deli beef cheeks just think the size of your little cheeks yeah imagine the size of a cow with them and the cheek is right underneath here yeah um i want you to give them a really nice season with salt and pepper on there please so beet cheeks very cheap i cut that takes sort of a long time to cook yeah but give it a bit of love let it cook in the oven it comes out like a dream a little touch of oil in the pan what we want to do is get them really nicely colored shade see it into the pan oh cool layer wave see what that is um [Music] sitting at the dock of the the beach beach and then i want the onion chunky because i'm going to cook it for like three three and a half hours so you go down down down and then again there and there so it doesn't overcook so a really good color on the cheeks like that so how do you cook these at our restaurants if they take so long they go in the oven literally half past six seven o'clock in the morning three and a half four hours to be ready for lunch and the longer you leave them in their juices yeah and the cooking liquor the better three nice cloves of garlic good onions in and garlic in please nice where's your baby there it is get those onions and that garlic really nicely colored put the cheeks back in please right red wine in cool okay and the red wine is going to deglaze the pan so delays will basically sort of rinse all that flavor off the bottom of the pan yeah okay because that's going to make the most amazing sauce now you could use tomato puree but chopped canned tomatoes you'll make a much better sauce i'm going to top that with some stock so the secret of brazing is having little of the meat exposed and 90 percent of it submerged see them now yeah they're like little crocodile heads popping up out the water turn the gas off and leave the lid just off at the end there if we had to cover it completely the steam hits the top yeah the lid and all that water comes very important solar still that's right in the oven 140 150 for about three and a half to four hours good job boom we're gonna now do the fig and broader crostini oh okay let's take the figs we're gonna make a nice slightly spicy fig jam take off the tops yeah in half and each half into three sugar the touch of salt in there okay we're making a jam but we don't want to be too sweet and then these little babies what are they ah what's the shape stars star nice stanley's taken from the hennessy plant yeah when you dry them like that so intensifies the flavor really important to count how we put in there okay yeah so one two three four five so they're just there for a flavor and then you take them out that's right secret here let's get that camera going so when i hear of jam i don't think of caramel no but this is a very fast jam caramel's starting to color i want you very carefully to drop the fig's in there good so the juice out of the figs is starting to break down the caramel you know what that is well sweet vinegar i love that on my salad you've got that sort of sweet and sour flavor leave that cooking for three four minutes now let's slice our chipotle in italian crostini means little bits of toast but it can be made out of leftover baguette sourdough or any crusty open textured bread we're staying authentically italian with ciabatta season them and then drizzle a little touch of olive oil on there both sides really important because we're going to grill the bread push it down put some lovely take it off with the chipata toasted we need to carefully extract the star in these pods from our piping hot fig jam my jacket we've got one little bugger to find oh no is it there yes it is right now we've got the green light to crush some of the skin's disintegrated in that camel that looks so nice while jack carefully spreads the crostini with our hot fig jam i can unveil the last element to our starter the creamy italian speciality burrata a little money bags they can delicious this looks fun doesn't it we need to season them lightly drizzle over a little olive oil and dust them with lemon zest can you imagine that sat there and you tear some of it off and you stick it on top of that back to the main course to match our hearty beef cheeks i've chosen to use papridelli rule number one when cooking pasta salt in first salting first good olive oil in pasta in twist it round so you don't break it no bring that back up the ball that's gonna take about three or four minutes flat leaf parsley scrunch it up for me yeah and chop him now wait to see these beef cheeks beauties look at them oh look soft they're very soft tiny to taste that's so good oh jack you just dribbled on your jumper joke really right drain the pasta salt pepper pasta little drizzle of olive oil i want to put your fresh pasta nicely chopped nicely chopped in this is the magic bit okay you take a little ladle of the juice put that at the bottom and you put the pasta on top of that sauce honestly oh my gosh your sisters are gonna love you even more now you know uh what about when you cook this with your girlfriend one day uh just tell her where you got the recipe from william promise promise i don't want you stealing daddy's thunder

nice let's go on to the hot plate let's go for six please jose now we're doing four more yes here's a food skill i've always wanted to learn i love chinese food but there's one amazing delicacy so specialized that few western chefs have ever mastered it so today i'm off in search of some eastern culinary wisdom this is chinese dim sum an absolute staple eating for breakfast lunch every day and for the first time i'm gonna learn how to cook them properly but under immense [ __ ] pressure dim sum means touch the heart and it's easy to see why [Music] here at london's royal china club they serve a vast array of beautiful intricate little dumplings and rolls from regions all over china [Music] what began as a simple chinese snack has evolved over thousands of years into big business all over the world [Music] helping me to demystify the ancient world of dim sum is chinese cookery expert fuchsia dunlop this is one of the dim sum that sometimes westerners find a bit more tricky because it has that slithery texture which chinese gourmet is really a door to eat i'm used to being boss of the kitchen but as a dim sum virgin today i'm happy to be the pupil here we have the main kitchen area okay no these guys are very small do you mean petite but look at the space i mean it's it's my new behind here yeah and it's like an inferno when all the walks are going [ __ ] and this one here for steaming the dim sum right so you can have a stack okay on top later my challenge will be to get through a busy service at this top london dim sum restaurant but with just a couple of hours before lunch i've got a hell of a lot to learn [Music] for now i've been put under the expert guidance of zhang if anyone can speed teach me this incredible art he's my man in his 20 years as a dim sum chef he'll have made well over two million of these tricky little parcels but there's one small problem so it doesn't spaghetti english at all no i'm screwed then nothing at all hello good morning no i'm [ __ ] okay luckily future's on hand to translate his instructions good to see you so is this rice flour my first lesson is how to make a prawn filled potato flour dumpling called hagao [Music] hold in [Music] just like pasta the secret to good dim sum is as much about the wrapper as the filling that's what's going to hold all the flavor and moisture in hard cheese unlike an italian kitchen there are no pasta machines in sight [Music] jesus so he's using the palm of his hand my god [ __ ] they're beautiful huh they're so soft jung made it look easy now it's my turn okay use this the finger of this hand to push it this your index finger look so you're holding this and just pinching but you push it with that finger yeah yeah yeah [Music] yeah saying that it didn't sound particularly difficult because of all this fine finger work and you have to be a bit kind of calm and patient calm and patient yeah i'm screwed straight away right calm on patients i can't remember being this nervous in the kitchen and as any pastry chef will tell you hot sweaty hands are not what you need with all this delicate work it's so intricate so difficult jesus christ they're extraordinary that is a lot [ __ ] harder than it looks i tell you such intricacy and if i thought that was difficult i hadn't bargained on jung's next lesson chung fun paper thin cheese a rice and potato flour batter wrapped around a choice of fillings it's really hot so the most important thing with this is not to be afraid of scolding your hands in the steam right after just three minutes the skin scorching paper thin sheets of batter are ready to be rolled sticking to the clock like [ __ ] to a blanket i haven't felt this clumsy since i first set foot in a kitchen 20 years ago [Applause] the real killer is to wrap the filling tightly without splitting it okay [ __ ] me that was hard i mean seriously hard very intricate it's all in the manipulation of the dough with training over next will be put to the test under hard as nails henry chao the kitchen's head chef i'm told he's every bit as tough as me knows what service is [Music] i'm trying to [ __ ] get there get rid of that [ __ ] all right see that was the problem you know what the problem was that was trying to help me oh stop trying to blame me for it do you know what happened take your own responsibilities love you if i wasn't watching her i would have done the math whatever your heart uh cherry i wish your daughters were working as quick as you two yes look at them right misha can you do something yes no so you get the salad now i'm dressed as salad hey did you do that yeah right good come on come on come on come on guys diva are you happy with those let me see okay yeah yeah i'm all right with it i'm not too crazy about those two i'll be straight because it's curled up is that where i i'm glad you answered the div at least you know see you got me again service [ __ ] hell last table well done i really enjoyed it the mackerel itself was quite simple but you get the kick from the mustard and the spring onion afterwards really live and dish up visually it looked really great it's lovely green sort of color coloring and the yellow was you know from the potatoes was great um so yeah it worked really well okay jose results please okay the number of diners that are willing to pay for the starter is oh [ __ ] 45 out

holy [ __ ] what do you want to do [ __ ] floss with it jesus christ almighty [Music] watch out genesee porter's getting fruity smoothies heavenly fruit-filled drinks mango and passion fruit raspberry coconut and banana the perfect way to get your five a day what you've got to be joking who writes this rubbish my goodness we love smoothies don't we in fact we drink so much of the ruddy stuff it could fill 14 olympic swimming pools in a year that's almost 60 million pints personally i can't stand smoothies but you lot seem to think they're a healthy antidote to 21st century excess but are they if anyone bothered to read the labels they might be surprised to find out what they're really drinking a typical 250 ml portion is packed with natural sugar a portion of this smoothie has twice the sugar and twice the calories as this kind of tango [Music] this smoothie has got just as much sugar in it as this chocolate bar [Music] now this smoothie has got twice as much sugar and twice as much calories as this kind of lil [Music] it's not all bad news smoothies do contain vitamin c and many contain fiber too essential for a healthy digestive system but what about the natural sugars i want to hear the facts from kath collins an expert dietitian i've never ever ever drunk smoothie to me they're like green slurry they're hugely popular well they are because they count towards you five a day and everyone knows you should be eating more fruit and veg and they're a good source of fiber actually they do contribute fibre the problem is they're full of sugar i thought it was natural sugar sugar is sugar it has the same calorie load same effect on your teeth if you have an apple you've got about 10 grams of sugar in that if you're having a smoothie you can be having three times in one little drink you can swallow that in less than a minute and that's the problem it's just so much sugar in a very small volume taking a very short period of time what happens when you drink too many smoothies if you're in energy balance the amount of calories you're eating from your daily diet is the same as the amount your body needs if you have an extra smoothie each day it's giving you at least 125 calories and over a year that'll be almost an extra stone in weight 13 14 pounds they're not a low calorie drink and it is actually better to eat the fruit than it is to buy a smoothie it's official drinking to excess isn't good for you oh it looks disgusting this is certainly not going to convert me i've had enough of this trendy obsession with drinking fresh fruit i'm on a mission to tell people it's far better for you just to eat it now to really make my point i've got here this repulsive fake ass now this weighs 13 pounds and that is the amount of weight you could put on in a year if you drank one extra smoothie every single day than your body actually needed so let's try lifting it help come here drink one smoothie a day in addition to your normal calorie intake and you could put on weight but do people know this if they're not exercising enough to burn off their excess sugar they could be lumbered with a fat ass like mine one portion of that has got more sugar than that no did you know that no not at all i'd always think that like a smoothie would be much better if you did a fizzy drink wow let's say you're uh he's seven thirteen pounds i'll be doing any running in there what does it feel like bit heavy gross i drink these because like they're meant to be good for you the fruit is better i don't want that bottom just hold this bottom just try it this is from smoothies yeah that's quite shocking actually when you eat an apple yeah it tastes twice as long to eat as sloping down that smoothie do you know how much weight you put i just drink once oh yeah just like your size isn't it what do you mean just like mine right get rid of him i'm going to give you a smoothie and buckle off now well i think i've made my point with that horrible big ass and i hope very much that the commuters of london will now drink less smoothies and try eating a few more of these there's only one old smoothie that i've got left to convince janet i've been taking smoothies out and trying to convert people to drink less smoothies and eat more real fruit i love smoothies what's wrong with them so how many do you eat and what are they one a day you're done no seriously it's a good job you're hyperactive are they seriously that full of sugar they ask for a lot of natural sugar fructose which is still sugar yeah so you're saying eat fresh fruit instead of a smoothie yeah i can see you're wearing that rubber ass it's sushi it makes that joke i've got the rubber ass oh you've got it although we had it on this is the rubber outsole okay oh still that is what

tablespoon of white wine vinegar that forms a really nice paste and it's ten times tastier than anything no it's really nice i know it tastes delicious i've made it before you do a lot of cooking at

some aubergine in i'm just gonna dice up some potato and some cauliflower and bang that in uh most daunting gig ever was when well i think it was probably a gig that i did up in um bolton in a working men's club yep and as one they all shouted [ __ ] off your fat leather as they went on and it's true in the early days the lessons used to complain about it give them a bad reputation right over the years they've signed petitions and sent them to me telling me to tell everyone i'm heterosexual because it's giving lesbians a bad reputation okay swept the aubergines and the slots down first garlic

a half stone in fact just under 18 stone when i ran my first marathon wow it was a [ __ ] nightmare i got back it was dark the family [ __ ] off home and i was picking cones up on the way home see

make dim sum i'm about to be thrown in at the deep end at the royal china club in london [Music] this place can do over 200 covers and like any head chef worthy salt the uncompromising henry chow

Gordon Ramsay's Ultimate Fit Food/Healthy, Lean and Fit – http://po.st/REpVfP...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, [Music] next five more my 100 tips to help you cook better kicking off with how to whip cream whipping cream now the important part here is whipping the cream to a three-quarter stage if we over whip it it will split so be very careful double cream in now when we whisk things we whisk it in the shape of a figure of eight and if you spin the bowl as you whip the cream you get to release it from the bottom so it whips evenly whisk whisk whisk and it should just sit inside the whisk and start to sort of fall out just perfect three-quarter stage double cream done room temperature cream whips much faster than cold so you'll need to take your cream out of the fridge 30 minutes before you want to whip it unless of course you want to work on your biceps a great tip to prevent milk and cream from boiling over in a saucepan is to simply lay a wooden spoon across the top the cream bubbles will rise up and hit the wooden handle and then fall back into the pan instead of bubbling over sticky stuff like trickle and golden syrup can be a real mess to measure out my tip is to rub the spoon with a neutral oil like rapeseed and any sticky ingredients will slide straight off [Music] and my tip for greasing cake tins is to keep old butter wrappers on hand and use them to crease when needed [Music] with how to handle pastry lightly flour the surface pastry on top rolling pin now the secret now is don't overwork the pastry firm push turn the pastry round and this helps to even the pastry turn and roll now as it starts to crack don't worry just by pushing it back together it sort of unites the pastry immediately apply pressure turn the pastry now the average thickness is down to a one pound coin back on to the rolling pin and look beautiful for the neatest edge on tarts and quiches my tip is to let the pastry hang over the side of the tin when you bake it trim around the edge once the pastry is cooked it will give you a cleaner edge and prevent it from shrinking my tip for even rising is to place cakes and tarts in the center of the oven so the air can circulate all the way around them to test your cake to make sure it's done insert a knife skewer or even a piece of spaghetti in the center if there's mixture stuck to it it's not done yet if it comes out clean your cake's ready [Music] if you don't have any baking beans to hand for blind baking you can use any rice grain or pulse you won't be able to cook with them afterwards but do keep them to reuse them next time when you're folding egg whites and whipped cream into cake mixtures you want to retain as much air in the mixture as you can my tip use a metal spoon as the sharp thin edge will keep more of the air in [Music] starting with how to cook dark breasts perfectly the slow way duck breasts never be scared about cooking this bird absolutely delicious very healthy first oven on 200 degrees and then salt pepper now the salt will help to extract the water out of the fat nonstick pan no oil but start the duck breasts in the pan cold skin side down it feels and sounds a little bit weird but if you put them into a cold pan and turn the heat up gradually it starts to release the fat if we put them into a hot pan it seals them in and the fat stays in there we want to render that fat down 90 of that duck breast will be cooked on its skin keeps the duck nice and moist but more importantly it stays crispy once the fat comes out turn the duck over nice high hot heat seal the duck now they're going in the oven skin side down six to eight minutes if your pan's got a plastic handle then transfer the duck breast onto a tray but make sure you put the tray into the oven to get hot first cooking duck is like cooking a piece of beef and you can't slice it piping hot all the goodness runs out just quickly turn it over push your fingers in there and it's slightly resistant but still quite bouncy and that confirms they're quite pink in the center but the important part now is leaving that to rest let them cool down and then we'll slice them keep that excess duck fat and there you go next time you're sauteing potatoes you just take them to a completely different level now slicing the dirt just slice it at an angle not too thin if you slice it thinly it goes cold quickly so nice thick slices nice crispy skin on top and a beautiful clump roasted duck all the white fat gone nice crispy skin absolutely delicious [Music] another slow cooking tip is when slow cooking stews and casseroles fat will rise to the surface to get rid of any excess oils my tip is to remove them with kitchen paper before serving [Music] this also works brilliantly on gravies and sauces many great slow-cooked dishes start by browning the meat as the meat cooks lots of flavors get stuck to the pan to get it into your sauce deglaze with wine stock or vinegar never add soft herbs at the beginning not slow cooking they're all too delicate the tip is to add them at the end for that hit of fresh flavor and vibrant color a great tip when frying fish is to always fry skin side down to keep it crispy and always lay the footage away from you when adding to the pan to prevent hot oil from splashing towards you first how to make a fantastic chicken stock a classic slow cooked recipe that gets amazing flavor from simple ingredients chicken stock the vital ingredient to good cooking it transforms sauces it's a fantastic base for soups and more importantly it's so easy to do a little bit of love and care at the beginning and it cooks itself right step one chicken carcass into a pie-sided pan an onion doesn't need to be finely chopped the vegetables flavor the stock onion in then from there cut your leek into nice big solid chunks roughly same size as the onion so the vegetables cook at the same time and then our carrot celery in garlic and then a nice sprig of thyme that helps to really give depth of flavor to the chicken stock a couple of bay leaves and some fresh parsley and then peppercorns pan and just lightly crush them and a little pinch of salt and now just cover the vegetables and the carcass with cold water just cover the chicken and the vegetables bring it up to the ball as quick as you can now as it comes into the boil a really nice skin take the base of the ladle and swell that around that pushes all the grease and the impurities to the side of the pan then get your ladle and just tilt it if you don't skim all that off the stop becomes very cloudy people's impression of cooking stock then it needs to cook for three four hours at a time this is one chicken carcass let that boil away gently for 30 to 40 minutes maximum now we're going to pass it off take a sieve place that over the pan and then just pour that in it smells amazing it's aromatic the color is absolutely beautiful and there you have the most amazing stock when you need to season meat in flour a great tip is to place it in a plastic bag to dust it evenly using flour also helps the sauce to get nice and thick during cooking when browning meat fry in small batches don't crowd the pan otherwise it won't sear or color properly when slow roasting meat line the bottom of the roasting tray with chunky vegetables like onions fennel and carrots they act as a trivet to keep the meat from boiling in his own juices plus the veg can be the base for your gravy later on after slow cooking baked on residue can be tough to remove but if you boil water in the pan it will dissolve and break down then simply pour out and wash with soap and water [Music] i absolutely love these peppers now they have the most amazing sweet delicious flavor with a really nice crunchy texture and the most exciting thing about the peppers is that they're just as delicious raw or cooked to identify the perfect pepper must be smooth and firm and not a wrinkle inside now how to cut the perfect pepper stalk off pepper down and get the knife start from the top and slice all the way around basically we're gonna be slicing around the seeds look no faffing around like this little perfect christmas tree of seeds and you haven't got the mess all over your board and more importantly it's twice as quick discard that now we're going to cut it into a julienne flatten the pepper skin side down onto the board because it's a lot easier to slice through the pepper and just lift the knife up and down and basically julienne is a chef's word for strips these are absolutely perfect for sauteing and that's what we're looking for there crunchy delicious and more importantly no seeds beautiful many great brunch recipes start with a delicious fresh egg my tried and tested way to tell if your egg is fresh is to simply place it into a bowl of cold water a fresh egg will sink and a stale one will float if a small piece of shell goes into the bowl when you're cracking eggs my tip for removing it is to simply use a larger piece to fish it out it works like magic for prize winning fried eggs fry them in oil adding a tablespoon of water then cover the water steams the top of the egg to perfection toasted bagels are brilliant for brunch my tip to make sure you always have them on hand is to stock up your freezer but make sure you slice them first that way you can pop them straight into your toaster first up how to peel and cut a mango the easy way holding your stalk end up cut either side of the stone cut all the way into the flesh making squares without cutting through the skin then turn it inside out and carefully cut your pieces off a great tip to check if a pineapple is ripe is to pull a leaf out from the top if it comes away easily it's ripe and ready for slicing my tip to get the flesh out of a kiwi is to simply cut the fruit in half and scoop it out with a teaspoon try it it really works if you have fruit that's not perfectly ripe the tip is to put a banana in a paper bag then add your unripe fruit put in a dark place and the banana will speed up the ripening process of the other fruit you can make a grapefruit puree to accompany a brunch pancake or a crumpet in a blender to clean it afterwards add a cup of warm water and run the machine for a few seconds empty out then simply repeat with a drop of washing up liquid then rinse this has to be the most popular part of the chicken now very versatile incredibly tender very lean hardly any fat whatsoever the secret is cooking it without it becoming dry the first thing is to season it properly both sides two tablespoons of olive oil get the pan nice and hot the secret now is to get a really nice color on the skin really nice color no color no flavor skin side down tilt the pan so it cooks the back of the chicken breast where it's really nice and round and very fat let the pan do the work chicken breast normally takes between sort of 10 and 12 minutes to cook properly now we've got the color on the skin the skin's nice and crispy we're going to deglaze the pan deglaze with masala now masala is a sweet fortified italian wine you can also use white wine masala in flambe burn off the alcohol which gets rid of that really sort of harsh alcoholic flavor roll the chicken around the masala delays in the pan basically means washing the pan and lifting off all that flavor stuck to the bottom of the frying pan and putting it into the sauce now chicken stock bring that up to the boil and let it simmer for three to four minutes [Music] it's really important to leave the chicken breast skin side up the skin's nice and crispy and it's important now the chicken cooks from underneath as it starts cooking it absorbs the stock so in the center of the chicken stays nice and moist [Music] now the stock of the masala has reduced down you have the confidence to allow it to almost disappear and look the combination between the masala and the chicken stock is quite sweet so it finishes the chicken with this really nice delicious glaze on top and there you go a delicious succulent chicken breast with the most amazing flavoursome skin phenomenal soups make stunningly simple meals my tip for adding incredible depth of flavor is to always keep your leftover parmesan rinds store them in the freezer then add to the pan as the soup cooks and leaves to infuse then remove before serving is less waste and more taste another tip to take homemade soup to the next level whisk in cubes of cold butter just before serving to get a glossy velvety texture and a beautifully rich taste another fantastic standard for a fuss-free weekend eat is the classic baked potato my tip for a great crispy skin is to use salt to your advantage simply add it to the outside before cooking and the salt will draw out the moisture in the oven as it bakes a touch of salt gives you an amazingly crisp skin on chicken and fish too as well as highlighting the flavor [Music] home roasted nuts make a delicious tv snack my tip for peeling them with these is to simply toast them in the oven for about 10 minutes wrap in a tea towel and rub until the skins are removed perfect sprinkle with sea salt and so with a glass of wine chopping herbs the secret is to chop them not bruise them now basil this is a soft herb so treat it with some respect when people go mad chopping herbs all the goodness comes out on the board i want the goodness left inside the basil place them all inside one another with the largest leaf at the bottom and it's almost like rolling a cigar large one at the bottom small ones in the center and then look place them down together just roll them nice and gently don't bruise them step one rolled ready to slice sharp knife imperative fingers tucked in the bottom part of your knuckle is the guide between you and the herbs that there stops you from cutting your finger really important to get comfortable with a knife and just practice rolling the knife across the board and relaxing that wrist it's all in the wrist action so herbs up fingernails tucked underneath and just up and down up and down and there you have a chopped basil that's not bruised and smelling very fragra right coriander so you get the bunch of coriander hold it down and just lightly shave the leaves off the stalks bunch them up together and then just again let the knife do the work take the fingernails in and just chop once and once early don't hack it just chop it you can always identify when you bruise the herb when you've removed the herbs off the board there's a big green patch mmm full of flavour and none of the goodness is left on the chopping board a great tip for using leftover herbs simply chop finely mix into butter roll up in clim film and freeze then when you want a herbie hit cut into slices and melt over steaks chicken or veg asparagus is great for a simple supper to prepare always remove the lower woody stem by gently bending and the asparagus will snap at the perfect point then boil or steam and serve with a little of my herb butter for a cracking soft boiled egg simply place your egg in boiling water add a splash of vinegar and cook for exactly eight minutes then plunge into ice water the vinegar helps the shell peel off easily and the ice water stops the egg from cooking giving you the perfect runny yolk [Music] for fuss-free salad dressings simply add the ingredients into a jam jar screw the lid on tightly and shake to combine in seconds there's no need to wash up a whisk and the jars ready made to store any leftovers with how to prepare prawns to prep it get the head and twist keep hold of those heads make the most amazing stock and then with your thumb get underneath the shell and just peel off that beautiful little layer now with your thumb on your finger push and shake and look the whole tail comes off you don't have to peel the whole thing from there get your knife and just gently cut the surface of the prawn and what we're looking for there is that little dirt sack that's got to come out otherwise if you cook the prawn with that sack in there it's crunchy it's not very nice and it ruins that sweet flavor and there you go the most amazing prawn ready for cooking serving whole fish always makes an impact here's how to fillet it at the table run a knife along the backbone remove the skin and carefully lift off the portions of flesh using a fish slice then just lift off the backbone in one careful movement whole hams are always impressive to carve one easily hold the hand by the bone and cut down the meat as close to the bone as possible you can then lay your cut hand flat on the board making it nice and easy to slice thinly and evenly for perfect pork crackling pour over hot oil before roasting in the oven it'll come out beautifully crisp and crunchy and when you need to chill wine fast simply add a large handful of salt to your ice bucket the salt reduces the freezing point of the water which will chill your wine in six minutes flat scallops are a fantastic ingredient when you want a special salad that really impresses here's how to prepare them do not be intimidated trying to get the scallop out i'll show you how easy it is to take them out and how much more exciting it is to get them fresh in the shell so just basically dessert spoon and a blunt knife put the knife in to the bottom and you just twist open tilt the knife up so it doesn't cut into the scallop meat run the knife from the top to the base off of the lid no flesh on there and then from there that's called the scallop skirt all you do is just peel that forward and get the spoon to run down the back of the shell and the idea is to remove that little bit of muscle that holds the scallop onto the bottom shelf bang it pops out that's the top the small side to the bottom there's the muscle there and your thumb just slides neatly in there and run your fingers round and you just pop out scallop and look bang beautiful this bit here is called the skirt no use doesn't taste everything now that's the coral you can slice that off dry it in the oven and use it as a powder for your risottos or even seasoning fish with but that's the money these just need to be rinsed under cold water dried and ready for the pan tomatoes are another salad staple here's how to skin them for extra refinement score each one with a cross at the bottom blanch in boiling water for a minute then shot them in cold water and the skins will easily peel away pomegranates are a fabulous fruit for adding glamour to salads or desserts the trick to getting the seeds out slice in half lengthways make slits around the edge turn upside down over a bowl and using a large spoon whack as hard as you can to release the seeds [Music] to take fabulous fruit puts the next level my tip is to add sophisticated cornells of ice cream or lemon mascarpone simply dip two metal spoons in hot water scoop shape and add [Music] and after baking never throw out your leftover pastry it's easily transformed into grapefruit or savoury party nibbles roll out grate parmesan or sprinkle over your favorite fruit roll and then just slice and bake you

it okay right starter clay salmon with spinach and radish salad yeah really nice marinade noodles a little season a lot easier to seize them now in a bowl than it is in the pan and just place those noodles in as it cooks it sort of sticks together the salmon that's been marinated with honey soy dijon mustard and lemon and ginger grated ginger nicely seasoned and salmon in as they've cooked on the bottom we can take off the ring yeah yeah and all you're looking for is just a nice little light crisp if the oil is cold yeah the noodle's going to go greasy salmon if there's a thick slice like that turn out all four sides top bottom and both sides yeah vinaigrette soy sauce yeah honey grated ginger tahini okay which is really nice smooth paste of sesame seed to let the salmon rest take it off that is ready to come out nice and crispy a little bit of baby spinach just use the vinegar to season it lightly mix no seasoning no don't need it because that's quite salty now look at the center of the plate and just fan out just a little touch of dressing over there okay because underneath sometimes the radish can be a little bit bland around the outside noodles on and then your salmon i'm so hungry watching this have a little taste oh yeah get familiar with it right any questions no chef good very good right the dawson brigade yes first ticket on order four covers table two for salmon for duck four yogurt yes sir yes yeah not too much in there joanne otherwise it'll be a nightmare cooking and there you go you only need just literally there you go it's a nice thin base there you go that's absolutely fine make sure the salmon you put in yeah yeah pretty much the same size so they cook evenly yes okay right good there you go a little bit more oil in there because you're scorching it as a closer yeah okay right what you're doing i think you're taking them out too early and when you put them in the ring you're gonna push them down a little bit when they come out good girl they come out onto a nice cloth the drain that's it well done oh my they're going to be too you're going to say that's too much now aren't you uh yeah way too much quick right radishes on here [Music] so you would miss northern ireland it was yeah 10 years ago is that right i know it seems like well it seems like yesterday i know it was fantastic it was the best experience of my life i have to say and you still got the sash i have well done so you feel that salmon down the middle beautiful nice and pink are you ready yeah just be careful yeah yeah up and on there and i'll put the vinegar on good girl right are you happy with those yeah beautiful would you play with them i love them yeah they look fantastic right four more now let's go quick slide off please double know right time for jenna street farmer to take her calves for a family day out [Music] for the past few months janet's been bringing veal calves david and elton for the f word restaurant i should have trained that one for the grand national last week they went free range definitely the right decision janet's campaign to raise the popularity of british ville began by trying to get skill kids interested in eating it next you try to encourage consumers at ripon market to buy it can i tempt you with some fields due now janet's tackling the beginning of the chain the farmers who should be rearing veal today is the yorkshire young farmers country show [Music] an annual bash that attracts hundreds of farmers from all over the region [Music] janet needs to persuade these farmers to keep their surplus dairy calves and raise them for meat in the barn janet's grooming her boys to be the perfect ambassadors for her eat british veal campaign you look fantastic you do i don't want any more [ __ ] don't do one now it's showtime for david and elton but back at the country show things have taken a turn for the worse well it's pissing me rain in north yorkshire i've got up and i spent the first hour of my day wiping mud off the calf's bum and i wonder what golden's doing despite the weather janet's hoping a squeaky clean veal cars will create quite a stir here today hello where have i got to go [Laughter] so far she's been doing pretty well without them oh [ __ ] okay you're gonna have to back it jenna i'm afraid it's too tight [ __ ] useless well hold on janet you're gonna jackknife it well it's a bit tight isn't it yeah all right out here now you're about to do there yep i thought you're gonna make a right ass to that but you did very well janet sideshow is certainly attracting plenty of attention [Music] now i want concert but these are hard-nosed traditional yorkshire farmers if she's persuaded them to reveal first she needs to change their perception of veal farming hi hello what do you think of though are we going to make you a lot of profit i doubt it because it wasn't really about making money on these two it's hard to do with economics but if there was a market for it but they can't make them because it costs too much money to go on if we could persuade the british public to eat veal yeah yeah then it would be economically viable for you to rear it you've never eaten veal at all if you don't find it you don't take little calves there just no you know you don't find it on the menu it's still going to little carbs now you're talking out your ass if you don't mind me because these are slaughtered at exactly the same age as lamb i bet you eat lamb are you not getting a lot of positive a lot of people are very upset in their ways yeah it's well i mean we are yorkshire though we don't like change janet's getting nowhere it's no wonder with these outdated attitudes that there are currently less than 40 veal farms across the uk what she needs is some divine intervention maybe some refreshments will help the young farmers see the light have a biscuit if we hadn't bought them they'll be shot or gone to the continent which i think is cruel isn't it it's a complete white house success she's dug in her heels and janet's finally persuaded some of the young yorkshire men to consider taking up veal farming they look good dollo did you like one of my leaves thank you with a bit of luck the fields of yorkshire will soon be full of bill calves just like david and elton after their big day out as standard bearers for the british veal industry janet settles their beloved boys in for the night it's just so exciting being a film star the salmon's really soft and it works really well with the noodles and the radish and the spinach complements it well because it gives a light side to the dish as well nice to see how was your starter very nice thank you uh someone was cooked to perfection i just think that might have been well there was a fine line between chris being cremated with the new results tonight oh they're a little bit too colored something you try at home if he cooks it hold on a minute so who wears the trousers in your house i wear the trousers he wears the penny something in the army believe me i'm in the ball signals give us an indication in morse code whether you're going to pay for this or not daddy did it that means yes that's [Laughter] there's great texture and real contrast between the noodles which are very crunchy and the salmon very soft succulent beautifully cooked right jose let's go results please here we go whatever's in there i thought you did a [ __ ] good job yeah and the number of customers they're willing to pay for their starter 45 out of 50. excellent that is a very good starter hey a very very good start but here's the good news the high score will be going so fast yes okay i've only scored 39 out of 50 for the starter so already you're six in front yeah keep it up yes yeah now clear down

[Applause] right welcome back to the s word time for the main course [Music] progressively end up with madeira and cherry sauce packed with protein and absolutely delicious score season rub hot pan the secret here is seaming it on the fat side of the duck breast that'll give it a really nice crispy color in the oven 8-10 minutes 190 degrees madeira sauce hot pan olive oil shallots mushrooms season the secret of the madeira sauce is keep it really nice and sweet slightly fruity to help match the richness of the duck madeira wine absolutely perfect for making sauces with rich gaming me reduce chicken stock bring that out to the boil sieve cut rest out rest that's what i want all that flavour in there in my sauce cherries cut them in half [Applause] [Music] and then add our madeira

you go this one here the last one yeah very nice hold on first table table line please [Music] and what kind of food you fake black thai food chicken yeah you enjoy cooking when you get a chance to do it i like the achievement and the sense of achievement in the end when you make something quite nice so you started young rapping right yeah about that i didn't have been 14 i dj'd first i used to mix drama bass i started doing it for a joke and i started taking it seriously once i could vent them but at 13 years of age that's young by the time i was 15 yep i was on park radio outside the school i think one in the morning until three o'clock in the morning seriously on park radio then go to school yeah and ask everyone did you hear me and they didn't because obviously they were asleep fast it's a lump of [ __ ] it's from here it looks like a roast chicken something like jamie oliver's cookbook yeah nicest thing i can think of this actually came from a lyric i had at least have a lyrical lyrical tank boxing machine like my name was frank going on dirty going on stank rubbing and see that back these banks i just took the dirty on the stack made by the label from here it looks like a rose chicken with lemon thyme and herbs there you go appetizers in here i think we should do something together maybe you know that we should do a song yeah man you do this how nervous were you watching your son in the world cup oh i can't tell you where were you for the fight we were there shaking okay uh a little bit huh you can win the rugby world cup but you're panicking putting one dump press on the plate last table they have usually cooked yeah that's good really well done yeah ron what do you want this one i can see where your cooking skulls came from yeah and don't forget we like the duck breast slightly pink so when the sauce goes on top we finished cooking it yes yeah we don't serve the duck breast medium right ronnie happy with those thank you yes yes very good indeed [Music] right the best way to get rid of pests is to eat them some people are screaming about pigeon as a food because we make the mistake of thinking these dirty little buggers are the ones you eat but out of town there's a different species and a different pest wood pigeon are rich gamey and delicious but it's because they gorge themselves on millions of pounds worth of crops a year so to help farmers we should be eating as many as possible i'm in essex to learn how to shoot these birds properly with the help of pigeon big gun gary green where'd you shoot it were you looking for the head good head kill you're done with a spoiler meat no nice clean kill the lead passes through the bird nothing worse than eating a pigeon breast and you've got these little small ball bearings no that's right and it is it is crop protection is what we're doing i'm doing it for food yeah right i'm starving pigeon are one of the tastiest bursts to eat but one of the trickiest to shoot so i've opted for something as fast agile and unpredictable as they are to practice with now bring a little bit [ __ ] closer [Music] these remote control planes will mimic the pigeon's movement and if they don't explode i'm a [ __ ] shot [ __ ] pigeons are half that size [Music] [ __ ] tracking the bird attracting the bird move off and fire [Music] well done direct hit that one with my shooting skills improved i put the fact that these planes were much bigger than the size of wood pigeon to the back of my mind which is what i'm truly done right now for the pigeons yeah excellent thank you very much bloody hell thank you that was good practice we're heading to a rate field that should be in full yellow blossom but it's been eaten away and if it isn't protected soon it will be gone completely gary's laid out decoys to convince passing birds it's safe to land and that's going to track them over yeah sure you're sure you can get them from [ __ ] coronation street look at them huh stuck on the wall and it's crucial they don't see us first are you [ __ ] real seriously seriously all jokes apart i mean do we need this [ __ ] thing you will do we're talking about a pigeon yeah yeah but if we want them at 25 yards this is what we've got to do seriously i'm going to say are you taking the piss out me or what seriously don't this is it this is it i've got mine here go on oh we'll get arrested oh yeah that's it we're ready to show [Music] all we had to do was wait [Music] [ __ ] [Music] you're not expected to do well straight off it takes a while i am [ __ ] out do you see it actually came up to me and stuck the finger up shut on my head and then sucked off the pigeons were lightning fast and the excitement was getting the better of me [Music] ah [ __ ] okay now but there were plenty of birds look at that lock for you and i had plenty of cartridges how about this one safety off shoot and again yes lovely shot well done well done there holy jesus on your third shot well done brock the dog is used to find the birds quickly and prevent further damage to the crop yeah that's your bird sir you're very fantastic palumbo columbus about time no well done [ __ ] a top-notch shot can bag hundreds of pigeons a day like this many of which are exported to the continent i've been into it now and you yeah where pigeon is very popular well done with gary's help i shot three in around three hours and they weren't going anywhere well done [ __ ] i couldn't wait a lot more difficult than you think you know that oh yeah i knew it was gonna be tough i didn't quite think it was gonna be that [ __ ] hard in the kitchen i'd pluck the pigeons first but gary has a method i've never seen before so you're not plucking them no oh no no it's too messy right and takes too long yeah so i'm just going to dislocate [Applause] the wings yeah a little bit and just roll it out so bloody hell and no mess yeah and no feathers everywhere so dislocate the just locate it and wind it off and then break out right handed that's it yeah i'll just pick that off there and it'll skin right off jesus hold on christ of mine is so much quicker and a lot easier to cook with as well you know look how rich that is oh huh i'm very lean yeah lean healthy and [ __ ] delicious gary's taught me how to shoot and pluck them now i'm going to show him a delicious way to cook his pigeons i'm going to do a really nice salad of pigeon black pudding and pancetta cut through the wishbone which makes it easier to remove the pigeon breasts nice thing about pigeon is slightly gamey not too strong but bloody delicious that's what i want there though really nice thin marbling of the fat in there marinade in salt pepper and olive oil to keep the pigeon tender whilst i'm waiting cut up the pancetta into nice sort of lardons place the marinaded breast in a hot pan beautiful and literally one minute each side whilst the pigeon rests fry the pancetta in the same pan i'm chattering make a very very quick dressing i'm making a dressing with olive oil and cherry vinegar the cherry gives it a really nice tart exciting flavor add salt pepper and lemon juice [Music] just a little tablespoon of the vinaigrette so as the pigeons start to cool down it absorbs a really nice cherry vinegar and this is where we get the black pudding the black pudding gives it a bit of a spice yeah just crumble into the bacon that is a chef's dream that was fantastic delays the pan with sherry vinegar it gives it a really nice sort of vibrant flavor drain it through a sieve onto a plate that is fit for a king dress a watercress rocket and frisje salad and add the black pudding and pancetta mix that through colors are extraordinary but the real star is the pigeons for that i never thought an essex bird could be so [ __ ] tasty pigeon on a touch of vinaigrette off you go my man cheers thank you tuck in nice crispy bacon and a really nice pink pigeon what a lovely way of eating black pudding as well mmm in a salad crispy fried and the bacon jersey i can clearly cook but i can't [ __ ] shoot you know last table quick quick lowest run okay well done good thank you chad ah sauce hold on jojo yeah sure i haven't had those combinations before and the pak choi worked beautifully with it really crispy the duck was really tender beautiful dish [Music] now how was the duck awesome really good yeah i really enjoyed it something could try at home i reckon so yeah yeah yeah i thought the sauce might have been a little bit thin but other than that it was wicked really good good veg are you trying to shut off your chest hair or you forgot your shirt it's actually stitched into the t-shirt what the hell yeah i'm not i'm do you like your sandwiches oh it's all right that means no good to see it save room for dessert yes [Laughter] the cheers is really succulent um the madeira sauce wasn't too overpowering and the cherries really added something to the flavour it was just absolutely delicious it felt amazing to be part of a kitchen cooking for actual people you're just on the go all the time and also you're thinking about it too you know where you go to do this that and the other we are here to have an unbelievably good time we also want to win right results may cause jose anything let's get it right the number of guests they're going to pay for their main course is 39 out of 50. good that's not much that's not bad it's not bad so 11 not paying what are the reasons the sauce the sauce to watery anything else salt's too thin on the seasons under season on the seasons okay coming up are you a big fan of d5 mars bars never had one eve bowman puts on a brave hearty performance in the recipe challenge the brigade cook up a delicious dessert of yogurt honeycomb and berry cooley and tom parker-bowles takes nose-to-tail eating to extremes [Music] [Applause] beautiful welcome back to the f word now time for the recipe challenge and tonight's challenger is the heavily pregnant eater though good to see you good to see you if you're losing call your baby gordon right well middle name did that do what you're cooking uh i'm gonna do haggis going traditional scottish on your ass with uh neep and tarties now where'd the recipe come from um mom basically oh really yeah i grew up in a hotel so um so your love of food comes from growing up in restaurants i grew up in a kitchen so it was it was you know kind of instilled in me from a really early age it was my granddad and grandma started the hotel and then my mum's one of seven daughters i'll begin with e and we've got elsie elizabeth edna elena evie elaine and enid that is very scottish so um edie's doing a classic um haggis basically so i'm gonna do a really nice haggis hash brown uh mixed with swede potato a little bit worcester sauce onion and then i'm gonna crumble my haggis in to my hash brown fry it and stick a beautiful fried egg on top of that very good knife skills by the way nice fine dice you're making me nervous yeah you're only making harsh browns so uh what else are you doing tell me a little bit about the sauce you've got cream whiskey mustard a little bit lemon juice kind of just makes it a little

and i'll be two minutes and then we're just ready to serve okay get my egg ready in terms of uh when you grew up placed in the kitchen yeah i saw one dad working hard involving restaurants you never wanted to go into the industry no i kind of i worked in it from the age of 11. i needed to get out of that environment small town as well i kind of wanted to get to the bright lights big city look at that beauty let me just remove my room look you've even done the layers as well you are such a [ __ ] chef go girl i'll get it simple if that wins i am going to be pissed huh right jose come back with the best results right here's tom parker bowles the human dustbin when we think of eating pork we tend to think of sausages and bacon but every part of the pig can be eaten from the toenails through to the snout [Music] we're all looking for ways to save money on food bills and the cheaper cuts of pork could be the answer one of these boys is my pick there is in front of you this one here yes aha i mean look at the size of his bollocks that was a huge to prove the entire pig can be eaten those to tell i'm going to attempt to prepare and eat 21 dishes out of this porky little fellow costing just over 100 pounds my boy weighs 87 kilograms about one third of that weight would normally be thrown away i'm going to find out just how far a whole hog can stretch ah it just makes me feel a bit odd just looking at this awful's not much to look at but tastes fantastic there's used in many great traditional recipes we should all still be cooking so this being nose to tail nothing goes to waste not even the toenail so i'm going to take these back i'll be looking forward to eating these some of the offal needs to be prepared straight after slaughter so i'm taking my pig to a specialist butcher nearby tongue that's still connected to the trachea okay so all of this here is edible although it's edible even the lungs there that would normally be used for the something like haggis and then it's back to london to deal with the rest of the carcass so this is the whole pig here we got really isn't it everything okay whole pig legs yeah loins shoulders and the opposite the other side we've got the same as well seeing my entire pig laid out in front of me makes me realize just how little of the animal we normally consume and just how daunting a challenge i've set myself very important the [ __ ] of course that's going to be in my mouth later on [Music] today is the day i'm going to take on the challenge of eating my entire pig nose to tail i start with an italian breakfast dish known as tobego that contains kidney liver and black pudding beautiful now for the rest of the beast traditionally one pig could provide a family of four with enough meat to get them through the winter it's too much for me so i roped in my wife and some friends to help me out and what dinner party would be complete without one of these what did you guess what that is yup it is the pig's [ __ ] i mean look at that tongue although they may seem obscure these ingredients if cooked properly are delicious i'm using them to create a soup with a difference it's so sichuan style soup szechuan is a province of china the chinese are great offer eaters and the chilean spices should make this dish a real treat for the taste buds i mean it's something really fundamentally repellent about putting knives into eyes even if it's a pig's eyes i mean look at this this is this is this is that pig that nice little porker that not very long that was running around the field transformed i'm going to be serving 21 sumptuous dishes including a wonderfully decadent stuffed stomach of swine half head roast glazed in honey and cider a delicate sichuan tongue eye and penis soup crisp trotters with toenail garnish and testicles and brains sauteed in seasoned flour right on cue are my swine gorging friends just in time for canapes quite spicy now you're gonna tell me it's like testicle or something that's a heart it wasn't too scary that bit of lung liver a bit of heart but actually in that spicy sauce no worries at all so so far so good hunting food that's actually really nice i can't resist snaffling the chef's perk and the tastiest part of the head a crisp pig's ear very very good we go on to enjoy a feast of pig trotters served on a bed of griddle radicchio with herb the envelope but vinaigrette actually amazing some succulent ribs marinades and chili and expresso it's quite um asian isn't it we saw the the nose i'm sorry about three quarters of the way down now and they've been no complaints i'm really enjoying it and the unusual fits more than the straightforward then onto my stuffed pig's stomach a great way to use the fat gristle and skin season with thyme sage and parsley it's like stuffing it's delicious up until now everything has slipped down without insulin however as we approach the back end of the pig the last few dishes will really test the stomachs of my guests don't worry about the description this is the bullets in the brain [Music] i'm feeling a little bit queasy we are grinding boats what you do is sprinkle it into this this soup hopefully the flavor of the szechuan peppers the chilli will stop anyone tasting the bone the [ __ ] the eyes [Applause] final item let's have a little come and do the f word see the world will be an eyeball but it's not as bad as it looks pretty you're all man it's the thought there's nothing wrong with the taste i'm just thinking that i got an [ __ ] come on that doesn't taste nice surely tastes a bit of [ __ ] tom nice to see you myself oh well very well good i can't believe tom parker bowles ate a pig's [ __ ] i i had to eat it it sounds sensationalist but i wanted it no to tell to

If you...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, slow-cooked fiery lamb cooking's all about being bold and adventurous and this dish is exciting because it's slowly cooked and the longer it cooks the more flavoursome it becomes marinating the lamb first chili's we're going to use a mixture of red and green take off the tops and just slice in garlic crushed don't worry about chopping these ultra fine just get it in there cooking for up to three hours everything sort of blends and almost sort of purees itself together smoked paprika goes brilliantly well with the chillies two teaspoons in a touch of dried oregano some little cumin seeds the blend and the fragrance that they give out is extraordinary they release a little oil as well and helps to tenderize the lamb a touch of salt pepper cinnamon that sort of sweetens up the lamb olive oil just a tablespoon and the olive oil helps to sort of stick all those wonderful spices to the lamb jump in just start really rubbing at this stage you can leave the lamb to marinade for anything from half an hour to overnight allowing the spices to really penetrate the meat giving amazing results when you tuck in delicious vegetables carrots and onions and that's it sliced secret slicing vegetables for braising is not getting too thin you slice the onions too thin they burn you've got that horrible char taste on that slow braised grazing it's just a chef's term that means cooking in liquid on a low heat making the meat incredibly moist and beautifully tender so the secret of braising is having a really nice thick durable pan get that nice and hot just a touch of olive oil lamb in hold the bone because you're in control then into the pan i want that white fat to start rendering so it'll add more fat therefore making it a lot more flavoursome as it braises chili's cinnamon in mix that up and don't be scared you're not burning this you're sort of searing the lamb shanks and this is the important part right at the very beginning we're getting the color on the lamb which washes off as it braises in the oven so be generous with that color vegetables in wow and then a couple of baileys so now you lift the lamb up and get the lamb sat on top of the vegetables now just glaze the pan with red wine deglazing means that you're you're cleaning the bottom of the pan and you're getting that amazing flavor washed off and lifted up into that sauce can really transform that dish always delays then bring to the boil and cook for about 10 minutes to reduce the wine is reduced down by half now for the stock bring that stock back up to the ball and then into the oven now don't cover it when you cover it all the condensation comes off the lid your lamb becomes gray all this effort and that exciting spice gets washed away no lid and into the oven for three a hours cook on a low heat of 160 degrees gives the spices time to work and transform the meat so it's mouthwateringly tender now look at those out on to a plate you can just see that meat sliding down juicy and then creamy tender grab it by the shank roll around that rich delicious sauce look at that and get your sauce nice beautiful just get some mint don't chop it just pick that fresh mint and let it snow and there you go a very spicy delicious melting of the mouth lamb shank amazing when you're cooking for a special occasion you want to nail some key things one your recipes need to be bulletproof you don't want a disaster on the big day two as well as tasting phenomenal they have to be easy to serve so you can relax and enjoy yourself three when you're out to impress food needs to look great too my first recipe fits the bill perfectly stuffed lamb with spinach and pine nuts stuffed meats are perfect for special occasions they look impressive taste amazing but more importantly they are so simple to do pan on for the stuffing it's a saddle of lamb basically a sort of rolls-royce cut perfectly shaped and it suits stuffing to an absolute tea for the stuffing finely chop an onion garlic nice thin slices oil in onions and garlic in salt and pepper make sure the stuffing is beautifully seasoned so it helps to season the inside of the lamb now we've got the color on those onions we're gonna throw in some pine nuts and that helps to give a bit of a texture here's where it starts getting really exciting spinach in and just lay the spinach over the pine nuts it looks like a lot of spinach that's gonna condense and disappear almost instantly there's so much more flavor and spinach when you saute it as opposed to steaming it or boiling it gas off look at that now to bring that together no eggs no breadcrumbs crumpled feta over the spinach feta cheese adds a beautifully salty sharp and creamy flavor what this does it brings our stuffing together now open up the lamb keep those little fillets to the side that's the channel that we want to stuff so i want to just open that up a little bit there salt and pepper lightly and before we put our stuffing in we're going to season it with soon sumac is a wonderful lemony spice that goes brilliantly with lamb and you can get it in most big supermarkets and it sort of cuts through that thick rich sweetness of the lamb open up that lamb there take a spoon if you're preparing this for the day ahead then let the stuffing cool down it's inevitable when you start rolling it and tying it something's gonna squeeze out so load up the ends take these beauties these little fillets and just support that stuffing and sort of increase that beautiful tunnel and then from there over there and bring that towards you and then roll like i said some of the stuff is going to come out now to tie it first off around the side and don't worry about some flash butcher's not just tie it one in the middle you can get butcher string from your local butcher or at cookware shops i got two ties go too tight it just forces all that stuffing out of the lamb when it's in the oven nice now we just season the top of it roll the joint to make sure all the skin gets seasoned now you think normally that just goes in the oven like that that's how my mum would do it but get your tray onto the gas oil in get it really nicely colored none of your stuffing is coming out the sides really important look at that color beautiful does kickstart the roasting process gas off into the oven cook for 45 to 55 minutes depending on how pink you want your lamb lift the lamb out of the fat to rest resting it raised up in the tin will stop it cooking but not cool it down too quickly and means you won't lose any of those lovely juices next i'm making a simple but sophisticated accompaniment for the lamb top and tail the cucumber peel it cut the cucumber into three and just core taking out all that it's just sort of watery seedy and it spoils the flavor slice cucumber cucumber in really nice way of making a cheap and cheerful cucumber look glamorous we're gonna dress that cucumber with a nice fresh yogurt couple of tablespoons next some fresh mint dressing a touch of salt a touch of pepper and then pomegranate molasses that just sweetens it up finish that with lemon mix that up lamb it's rested carefully take off the string and then just gently pull them back a straighted-edge knife that's going to cut through that crispy fat on the outside instantly i tied it purposely so i can get my portion control from the lines hold it nice and firmly look at your line where the string was and look this one is going to be amazing lay and down just in those two slices there it proves that stuffing for special occasions because that is a saddle of lamb at its absolute best stuffing meats and fish not only makes them look fantastic it also gives them an extra added flavor dimension too once you've mastered the technique you'll be able to turn out dishes that will guarantee you'll have an unforgettable feast you

If you liked this clip...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, first up how to keep your knife sharp it's far harder working in the kitchen with a blunt knife than it is with a sharp knife the secret behind keeping a sharp knife sharpen it before and every time you use it first grip the steel feel really comfortable about holding the still imagine you're holding a tennis racket or you're playing squash you've got to be really comfortable with it now 45 degrees confident grip confident grip with the knife this is the butt of the steel really important to keep your fingers behind there you never grip a steel with your fingers over that because the knife comes back in you've just lost a finger always grip behind nice long strokes so we get the whole of the blade over steel stroke and we start from the bottom to the top so there across there across slow strokes over the top of the steel and then come back underneath then back underneath it is so dangerous working in the kitchen with a blunt knife you can cause so much damage working with a sharp knife is 10 times quicker more efficient now that's ready to start chopping to stop your chopping board rocking or slipping a great tip is to simply wet a kitchen cloth kitchen paper or tea towel and place it underneath [Music] now you can chop with confidence [Music] my next top tip is get the most out of your humble veg peeler it's brilliant for slicing ultra thin ribbons or veg perfect for asian dishes great for making long delicate parmesan shavings to top soups and salads it also makes wonderful chocolate curls your pepper mill is more versatile than you might think tighten the top screw to get finely ground pepper ideal for soups and sauces [Music] for general seasoning you want it medium ground so set the screw in the middle and loosen it right off for coarse pepper perfect for steaks and fish [Music] peeling garlic for one clove simply bash it with the back of a knife and the skin comes off easily for a whole head crush separate into a bowl cover and shake hard for about 10 seconds then simply pick out the peeled cloves how to chop an onion this is the root that's absolutely crucial leave that on there if you cut that off the onion will start to bleed and you'll start crying rapidly slice going forward let the weight of the knife do the work three fingers one in front two behind and this part of the knuckle is going to guide the knife fingers on top of the onion point the knife towards the root and try to get as close to the root as possible nice long stroke and then push the onion back together push the knife halfway in to the onion slightly tilt the knife down one at the top and then gripping the onion like a tennis ball holding it together in place with the weight of the blade to cut through that onion to get to the base of the root again turn it round up and down motion and that's what we're left there no waste just the root and look there you've got a really nice finely chopped onion so much great cooking depends on starting with a high enough heat if a recipe calls for a hot pan put it on early so it gets smoking hot and always remember to preheat your oven at least 20 minutes before cooking a clean cook is an efficient cook my tip for a tidy cooking area is to always have a waste bowl next to you it saves you going back and forth to the bin never add salt to eggs before cooking them because it ruins the texture and dulls the color instead save your seasoning to the very end [Music] the key to cooking meat is to make sure it's at room temperature before you begin cook straight from the fridge the mussel fibres will be tight which results in tough meat and always let it rest afterwards so it relaxes becoming tender and juicy how to de-seed chili to get the seeds out hold it upright and just rub the chili between your hands the seeds are incredibly hot just releasing them from the inside tapping it down and then again just a final little rub now cut the top off and then just open up and look they come out like little miniature smarties from there cut the little bottom bit off amazing next a great tip for using spare chilies using string tie together the stalks then simply hang in your kitchen in just a few weeks you'll get your very own dried chilies great crumbled into dishes for adding heat on demand chilies are surprisingly versatile if you love them in savory dishes my tip is to try adding them to melty chocolate ganache for chocolate chili truffles or sprinkled over fresh fruit like mango or watermelon a great tip to prevent burning sensitive skin when working with chili's to get rid of that spice and that heat on your fingers a little bit of lemon squeeze a little bit of lemon juice and that instantly gets rid of the heat fresh lemon juice spice up your drinks for a mexican twist add a dash of hot chili sauce to beer or using cocktails to give your drink a very different sort of cake first how to zest the lemon the important part is not to zest any of the pith watch the following technique and i'll show you how we've got these original graters really important when we use this we use the the fine zester not the big rough one not the one for slicing and not the other one for grating this little one here onto a plate because it's always easier to lift off from the plate than it is the board and the most important thing about zesting a lemon is nice long strokes but twisting the lemon round every time we go down we twist same with the orange and same with the line a little tap if you go too far let me just show you look you got that white bitter piff that destroys the wonderful zesty flavor and look that's what we're looking for there this really nice vibrant lemon zest delicious garlic is a key ingredient in so many spicy dishes my tip for finely chopping a mincing is add a pinch of salt for abrasion which helps break the fibers of the garlic down for a much better result for getting the most out of root ginger simply remove the skin using a teaspoon it's easier than using a knife and you can get around the tricky bits or just keep the skin on and give it a good wash [Music] never throw out vanilla pods there's a ton of flavour left in the skin stick inside jars of sugar and leave to infuse great to sprinkle on cakes biscuits or porridge when grinding up spices if you have any left over you can store in an airtight jar for up to two months great for a spicy kick to have at your fingertips a great cheap staple how to cook the perfect rice basmati rice the king of all rice is light fluffy delicious and i'm gonna show you how to cook it perfectly now start off with 400 grams of rice rice in spot on so what i'm gonna do now is just rinse off the dust and the starch cold water always and just rinse the rice that stops the rice from becoming clumpy in the pan and allows it to become really nice light and fluffy once it's cooked rice into the pan now to make a plain fluffy rice exciting we're going to infuse it three cardamom pods and just get the pots and just pierce them so it allows all that flavor to come out cardamom pods and then star anise now these are beautiful whole star anise it makes it really nice and fragrant salt and pepper a lot easier to season the rice now than it is once it's cooked you start to break it up when you season once it's cooked now it's basically one part rice to one and a half part water 600 mils always start off in cold water cold water in onto the gas lid on bring it up to the ball as quick as possible and turn it down and let it simmer for eight to ten minutes and that's the secret behind cooking great rice allow it to steam as it's cooking do not lift that lid up lid off [Music] it smells aromatic basically all the water's absorbed the rice has doubled in size and is nice and light and fluffy take the staranise out the cardamom pods they all should have risen to the top pods out take your fork fluff it through basically just sort of starts to open everything back up once you've fought it through it becomes really nice and light and fluffy and there that is perfectly cooked rice always make the most of your leftovers use last night's rice in stir fries scrambled up with eggs or it's simple to make a delicious fresh salad remember a good cook wastes nothing a great tip for stopping potatoes apples and avocados from going brown wing cut simply cover with water and add a squeeze of lemon the acidity stops the flesh from oxidizing which is what causes the color to change herbs are great for adding flavor without spending a fortune to keep them at their best simply place them in a glass of water and they'll stay fresh for up to a week and if you've got extra herbs left over save and waste by making an amazing flavored oil place wash and dried stems in a bottle cover with warmed olive oil then seal and leave to infuse great for salads pastas and drizzling on veg cooking pasta a great budget basic to keep in the cupboard it can be easily undercooked or overcooked here's how to do it properly first water in nice large pan to make sure the pasta's got sufficient room to cook evenly nicely seasoned absolutely crucial olive oil in that stops the pasta from sticking together bring it up to the ball that's the rolling boil the secret there it stops the pasta from sticking together and it gently rolls it around now this is angel pasta nice thin pasta takes three and a half to four minutes so into the pan as it hits the water it melts and then you turn it round tongs as that starts to melt gently twist that into the pan bring it back up to the boil if you're bad at timing then set a timer beautiful to test it lift a little strand and you can actually feel it with your fingers still nice and firm al dente not a bite not a strong bite but just really nice and firm inside definitely not crunchy and then into a colander drain the pasta in a light seasoning salt and pepper a tablespoon of olive oil mix that through that stops it from sticking together and look there you go beautiful pasta al dente cooked perfectly a tip for making the most of spare bread blitz leftovers into breadcrumbs great for stuffing or crab cakes or cut into chunks and freeze for perfect croutons on demand or simply tear a news in a delicious rustic salad dried pulses like chickpeas or lentils are great for soups and stews and cost pennies but don't season them until the end of the cooking or the salt makes them go tough for perfect boiled potatoes always start them off in cold water and never boiling water this way by the time the centers of the potatoes are cooked the outside won't be falling apart and when you're cooking potatoes always cook extra so there's leftovers they're fantastic to have on hand for making my delicious gnocchi and potato rosters for a classic bubbling squeak with how to skin and debone a fish the hassle-free way this is basically a filleted side of salmon it's been taken off the bone and now skin off pick up your knife a really nice broad flexible filleting knife a little sharpen lift up the base of the towel and then just nick a little bit at the end there twist the knife almost as if it's horizontally underneath the salmon pull the skin and you slice the salmon underneath and let the knife do the work now get your skin flip it back over and check you're not leaving too much salmon on top of the skin pull it back and nice and slowly get the skin wrap it around your fingers pull the salmon towards you and then just all the way through lay that down one nicely skinned salmon just like a perfect snakeskin get your knife and just run the knife down and then with a pair of tweezers these are fish tweezers but you can use normal tweezers look for the head up and pull and with the skin being removed from underneath the salmon the pin bones come out a lot easier the pinboards only go to just basically halfway along the fillet one nice fillet of salmon beautiful [Music] there's still plenty of flavor in the trimmings from affiliated fish my tip is don't waste those fish bones add to water wine a bay leaf and some chopped veg to make a simple but versatile fish talk at home the perfect base for a delicious fish soup [Music] a great tip for intensely flavored stress-free veg is to steam them in their own juices simply add to a pan with a knob of butter and seasoning then cook on a low heat with a lid on to lock in the moisture [Music] for crispy roast potatoes you can depend on my tip is to parboil them leave them to steam dry then sprinkle them with semolina or flour and give them a good roughing up this ensures they go really crispy in the oven a great tip for browning meat or fish is to dry with kitchen roll before you cook it then you'll get a much better color too much moisture makes the meat steam instead of sear and you'll lose that rich brown crust like the one i got on those sticky pork ribs my tip for amazing tuna capacho is to freeze it first and it will slice beautifully it's wise to save leftover wine for cooking my tip is to freeze the remaining wine in freezer bags or ice cube trays it's great in stocks and sauces [Music] when you freeze soups or stews in tubs the tip is not to overfill them leave room to expand in the container a great tip for a cheese homemade ice cream buy a high quality vanilla ice cream and make it your own by mixing in berries chocolate or my favorite rum and boozy raisins [Music] a fantastic tip for leftover lemons and limes is to cut them into wedges freeze and use them like ice cubes they won't water down your drink and they'll also add flavor first up how to join the chicken for your favorite real fast food dishes open up the legs and just pierce the skin there careful not to cut into the breast and hand on top of the breast and pull the drum back pop out and then slice the knife straight across there's the thigh there's the drum get your thumb and feel the joint and with the weight of the knife just slice these through now two beautiful thighs now a bit of a chef's tip halfway down the drum just sliced through onto the bone and then from there scrape the tendons and then hand down nice and firm on top now this beautiful bone presentation as it cooks it cooks evenly now pull out the wing feel where the end of the joint is and just slice in there through a beautiful big whole delicious wing now this is the rolls-royce part two breasts that's the breast bone there place the chicken on the board and then just slice down on the back of the crown everyone always cuts around just tilt it upwards straight through that way we get straight to the center of the carcass and therefore there's no waste and look we end up taking off these plump chicken breasts nice two drums two thighs two wings two breaths of chicken and one amazing carcass for a stock and not an ounce of waste a great tip to stop your skewers burning when you're making kebabs is to soak them in water first or for skewers with added flavour strip your rosemary branches of their leaves and use instead [Music] for no fuss marinading my tip is to place fish or meat in a plastic storage bag while they marinate it's easy to store and there's less cleanup lime juice or lemon juice make great marinades my tip for getting maximum amount of juice from a lemon or lime is to roll it hard under your palm for a minute before juicing lemons are also useful for rice add a couple of drops of juice while you cook it to keep your grains looking nice white and bright i want to cut my steak rare so by touching the steak i want the same feedback as it is on the inside of my thumb that's rare as it starts to cook it gets a lot firmer medium is there semi-firm with a slight resistance well done it's there rare a great tip for getting meat or fish to cook faster is to score it which allows the heat to penetrate quicker this also allows marinades to be absorbed more deeply for stain-free tupperware coat it thinly with oil which acts as a barrier between plastic and food it's so easy to make your own chili sherry to use in quick stir-fries or sauces take 450 mls of dry sherry such as fino and using a funnel pour into a sterilized bottle add five whole thai chilies seal with a cork or lid and leave to infuse for a couple of weeks my tip for using any discarded chili seeds is plant them to grow yourself some new chili peppers plant in an egg shell or seedling trays start them indoors and move outside when they're ready you

toss if you've got the heat in the pan it does itself you know that yeah the job works itself there's not like a glazing effect again that's exactly what you're doing good question what we'll do is lay in the meat yeah yeah okay good cucumber on that's been sliced the seeds have gone the most important thing about taking the seeds out of the cucumber okay it stops becoming really watery yeah all the water and the cucumbers in this seeds okay so we get rid of that i'm learning right now we've still got the heat in the pan you can just hear the heat yeah nice crispnet leaf into the center and then from there over and again right over the pan that smells amazing and it's so quick so it's exciting about this okay it's vibrant it's very very healthy and more importantly so straightforward sure have a little taste of jesus right now jay you like that beautiful book you can meditate a spice in that uniform now can we tell you something do you get 50 portions out like that 50 very demanding diners we'll pay for that okay are we ready yeah yeah yeah yeah someone ordered yes four covers table eight four duck four sea green four milfoy yes yes yes chef excellent good one eight yeah okay nice clean cool i like that don't worry you'll get there come on jason yes you two got the same matching pajamas right yes do you feel at home now with a set of chef whites on yeah how do you know that hey trust me i've done my homework yeah right here's the perfect way to get rid of stress salmon fishing let's go stevie wonder weaving across the borders of england and scotland is the river tweed 97 miles of stunning scenery and more importantly home to some of the best salmon fishing in britain jack and i love fishing and we're here to try and catch our very first salmon in scotland with the help of experts bill stanworth and ian wood gentlemen good morning good morning i hope he's not jinxed today could he say bill good to see you hi nice to see you now never fished on the tweet before what's the chances yeah it wasn't a good chance it's not an easy river to fish is it sort of when you get down to the bottom end of the tweet a bit wide down there where we are today i mean this is one of the prime middle beats so yeah this is a good chance i've caught lots of trout but i've never ever caught a salmon thoughtfully yeah are you ready this is an amazing river you know that yeah there's a lot of big fish out there but fish seriously bigger than you okay so if you hook into one stand strong scottish salmon is world renowned it's organically farmed here to the highest standards but caught wild it's a true delicacy the tweed has one of the highest salmon catches in scotland and jack and i are determined to hook one of our own you know i can't look like idiots today we're gonna have to catch something because these guys are hard asses they're serious come on jump in wading through the water will improve our chances so looking a bit of a knob is a small price to pay you look like a womble all the gear yeah and no idea we're heading to some of bill's favorite fishing spots to learn how to fly fish the holy grail of fishing on the tweed it's a completely different technique isn't it from trout throughout fishing yes yes christ it's okay so you'll feel when it's right there we are you're fishing sir you need to walk the river casting every couple of minutes out of the 380 fishermen doing this yesterday only eight salmon were caught i was hoping jack would double our chances right jack go get your rod okay maybe you have a lot more luck than i'm having at the moment don't catch one before i do why you're in trouble i'll send you back to school with the two of us fishing and no quick catch i was starting to appreciate while wild salmon is such a delicacy and i knew exactly what i'd be doing with ours if we got any when it's smoked salmon is at its most flavoursome and it's most delicious i plan to make some at home that will taste 100 times better than anything you can buy in the shops but in the middle of the tweed that looked like a distant dream dad have you caught anything yet no not yet mate thank you jay no pressure they are difficult fish to catch aren't they bill that's all part of them part of the fun of it at 41 years of age scottish i cannot leave here until i've got one mid-afternoon we move to some faster flowing water known as the cold in desperation i changed tactics and ditched the fly fishing for spinning the way my dad taught me when i was jack's age the technique of spinning allows us to cover a lot more distance across the water then fly a lot quicker and you're constantly reeling in the lure imitates a small fish okay jack yeah fine to maintain salmon stocks conservation guidelines ask the put back every other fish you catch but that didn't look as though it would be a problem today my time is running out fishing for salmon is all about patience not my strong suit but i wasn't stopping until jack and i got one well we catch one we're gonna smoke it and mate is there any time in your life i'll allow you to smoke come on where are they finally a bite on my line [ __ ] yep he's on [ __ ] he's just running down the wheel don't let it go jesus oh [ __ ] he's strong nice and easy look at the size of that fin as this was the first salmon i caught in scotland if i could land it i could keep it [Music] yeah beauty excellent strongman there you go he's done [Music] come on you're gonna kiss a few old salmon trouts in your days come on kiss one more one more yes first ever and i mate you're here as well yeah together let's get buddy well we're gonna smoke it now yep that's gonna be really nice let's go and stevie stop a little taste you've got to taste onion enjoy yourself jc i feel like i've lost about four stones right guys you're doing a great job there's three tables to go yes nice nice if you can't stop [ __ ] me amazing here's the question if you're both in the kitchen at the same time who's the most dominant probably jason i allow him i'll get lost keep the pan away from the plate good girl well done nice and gently yeah then we're all nice and clean last minute sprinkles up let's go well done i don't want [Applause] well that now let's hope they all pay for it yes well done good evening ladies gentlemen welcome nice to see you how was your starting slightly peppery for me a little bit too hot or um yeah quite a lot of pepper it's overpowering damn the idea of the cucumber going in of course was to sort of cool it down a little bit combined with a lettuce of course to make sure that wasn't too hot something you could try at home yes definitely yeah either it's fantastic the duck was well cooked not not overdone right it can get a bit tough absolutely are you on a hard time this week should i be drinking yeah my mom my mum knows she's sometimes stuck is too rich for me because it can be really lots of oil in there but actually this it's quite delicately flavored jose okay the number of customers that are paying out of 50 that is fantastic 46.50 really good yes 46 out of 15. yes really good now for me course i want perfection hey we're on the roll now we're on a roll out of 50. well done great start right on your section's clear down coming up i'm with the fire brigade in oldham trying to ignite a passion for healthy eating when was the last time the station saw some lettuce in there oh yes and david and elton finally come out i should have trained that one for the grand national [Music] [Applause] joan any seasoning on that fish no [ __ ] welcome back to the f-word time for the main course [Music] saffron marinade fill it's a sea breeze a nice sweet delicate flavor and the skin once it's crisp is delicious score olive oil saffron place the fillets skin side up then just leave that to marinade in the fridge sweetens our peppers slice the thinner they are the quicker they cook hot pan olive oil [Music] season the secret now is to start the caramelization sugar red wine vinegar that gives it this sour flavor out onto a plate cool green most exciting thing about the sea green now is that it's changed color hot pan skin side down lovely season once that's in the pan take your peppers basil and all you do is just mix that fresh basil through those wonderful sweet and sour peppers [Applause] [Music] baste [Music] olive oil and that has to be the perfect way of eating sea bream with sweet and sour peppers saffron marinaded bream with sweet and sour peppers done that's it good toss i'm putting you in nice stevie we can do this joe yeah sure come on get all these out but we're going to get good absolutely let's just get them out fish has got to come out the pan ladies yeah james it's absolutely

[Music] start again yeah stevie i want you to finish this table with joan and then we'll do a four together okay you and i [ __ ] you now come on guys you gotta step up again now yes now this lot need help and it's a real food emergency firefighters need the right food to have the strength to tackle their dangerous job you'd think they'd eat properly but when they're on call they often take the easy way out with fast food and takeaways alison o'donnell is one of the four percent of female firefighters in the uk and the only one working at this station we tend to eat a lot of study food career chips with everything it does make you feel quite heavy i don't like vegetables at all they don't smell nice they're just horrible it looks like i've got my work cut out for me here i'm in oldham to meet the white watch firefighters who seriously need help with what they eat alison how are you hi gordon nice to meet you likewise good to see you too my darling that looks like hard work it is hard work run me through a normal dinner what would it be a normal dinner would probably have say curry chips in terms of um budget wise i mean how much have you got to spend on food realistically it's about two pounds per meal per person so you don't get an allowance no we pay our own food that's why we're so stingy anyway blessed are the talking let's get you some pit on and get joined us right you're right bossy car you aren't you i'm going to show whitewatch how to cook a healthy alternative to their usual fast food but first to give me an idea of what they face day to day they're sending me into a fire simulation building to find a survivor in the kitchen what would you cook a chicken nut roast chicken 180 190. well typical house fire 1000 degrees the simulation is designed to recreate the conditions of a burning building and disorientate me in constantly increasing temperatures i'm wearing a fog filter which impairs my vision exactly like real smoke would finding a casualty in these circumstances is like finding a needle in a haystack the more i exert myself in the heat the quicker my oxygen supply goes down you've got 120. come on it's person's departed come on with virtually no visibility alison and i eventually find the dummy victim and i start carrying it to safety [Music] then my air supply runs out and i have to scramble to get outside [Music] had this been a genuine fire i'd have been in real trouble that's manic in there oh my god i love the heat but from a kitchen point of view not from a house on fire having trained with allison and her team i know that filling their bodies up with stodgy food is the last thing they need i'm going to show them a healthy version of one of their favorite foods burgers and chips today it's alison's turn to cook so i'm taking it down to the supermarket to get everything we need for just two pounds ahead are they vanier when was the last time the station saw some lettuce in there oh yes right capers for the relish excuse me you put me in a grass yeah with a master i couldn't see food oh it's all right actually i don't think this will be under 20 quid i'm hoping that is going to come under that 1969 1969 yes look at that [Music] my healthy homemade beef burgers will give the firefighters the energy and nutrition they need burgers don't have to be full of fat if you make them yourself you're in control of exactly what goes into them the most amazing burger yeah yeah a beetroot radish and homemade chips right okay fried mints season with salt and pepper and then mix smoked paprika gives depth to the flavor cayenne pepper add some heat tabasco sauce for even more kick i like to remember not to scratch my eyes after no no that's gonna be hot add worcester sauce and ketchup to season mould the burger mix into patties and place them in the fridge to firm them up easy to cook later on guys how do you like your burgers rare medium big loud cut potatoes into wedges and part boil in salted water baked potato wedges are a healthier and tasty alternative to chips then prepare the baking tray for the wedges with salt pepper and olive oil [Music] [Applause] season the parboiled wedges with olive oil salt pepper a little tabasco sauce chili flakes and finish in the oven on preheated trays right uh beet root and capers behind yeah okay we're gonna make a really nice relish now beetroot is rich in iron add balsamic vinegar salt pepper olive oil capers and then blend flat leaf parsley adds an earthy fresh quality to the relish that's quite nice just said all that beetroot that's lovely we've done that quite quickly nice chop salad to add color and toast your bats to stop them going soggy then we're ready to go [Music] hey are you hungry [Music] lovely tomatoes a nice healthy quick yeah under two pound yeah cheap burger absolutely well done well done very good come on guys let's just speed up a little bit we can finish this one properly let's go let's go all right guys last two tables yes i got one six and one table of two yes let's go let's go let's go oil in oil done fish done make that the best junk please okay golden yeah come on guys two tablespoons just concentrate on the fish i'll do it okay we've got eight here going i've been there's lovely by the way how many plates are now four beautiful fish yeah nice color nice and gentle not

check check check clean the plates and don't run away from me come on double check that fish steve let's go go well done yes jason seriously well done yeah hardest ever okay clear down guys yes yes right time to find out what jana street farm has been up to over the last two months janet st porter has gone all old macdonald raising veal calves for the f-word restaurant in a back garden in north yorkshire [Music] come on get on the case so far janet's been keeping the boys indoors on the advice of joe collinborn a veal expert with over 20 years farming experience joe's helped make sure janet's calves are happy and healthy with lives that are a million times better than carth kept in veal crates he's advised keeping them indoors because he reckons barn reared calves are less muscular than free-range calves so they produce more tender meat however some farmers think slightly differently well this is such a dilemma whether to let david and elton out of their barn and be free range well i need to discuss this with someone who's a bit of an expert so i've come up to scotland janet has come to dumfries and galloway on the scottish borders to visit dominic smith's farm where he lets his cars run free because he believes it produces better meat hi hi so you don't think that keeping the calves outside makes the meat tougher because that's what some people say certainly not in our experience um we found the meat very tender but it's got a bit more character about it almost all veal calves begin their lives indoors so in here we have our very young calves that are still feeding milk what's a pig doing in here excuse me the calves don't seem to mind them and they'll lick the milk off the floor i can't believe it [Music] right where are they go on at dominic's farm at 12 to 14 weeks the calves are let out to pasture and when you sell your mate you've got happy customers who've never said it's tough no well they do look very healthy so guys he's coming in with us he wants lunch too have you got a big car free range farming clearly appeals to janet but is it any good for the meat the truth is in the tasting never before has so much depended on one steak if janet likes the flavor and the texture of dominic's free-range veal david and elton could live out the remaining weeks in the great outdoors great you have to be worried then for a minute that's strong silence i was thinking about it having seen them tasted both sides of the story janet heads back to yorkshire to decide how to raise the calves for the remaining few weeks you say his meat's tender but um it'll be a different type of meat than what i'm producing but do you see mine is on whole milk right away all right i can see this i've gone 12 rounds right oh no i'm sorry john don't apologize i'm sorry you're a woman of principles i'm sorry very few men could move you weren't sure i'm sure i'm sorry i've seen how dominant does it and i think for the bit of life they've got left i want them to have the same view that i have so they start crapping all over each other and wiping their asses on the wall i've made my decision they're coming out jailbreak oh yeah yeah go for it [Music] i should have trained that one for the grand national nevermind about golden's field dinner definitely the right decision [Music] so janet and her cars are happy the only beast locking horns on this farm are joe and dominic there's a severe physical stress there so will janet's free-range gamble pay off we'll find out in a few weeks when david and elton are slaughtered and served in the f-word restaurant let's just hope she's not having second thoughts [Applause] [Music] danny welcome back nice to see you my darling thank you thank you always a pleasure oh now good news david and elton yes yes come out i just thought they've spit in that barn now for quite a few months yes and it's boring they've only got a few weeks of life left let them have a bit of fun now that they're free range yeah it's not that far away the end is in sight are you getting attached or have you yeah i'm involved with the i'll be sad if they don't taste really great after all that effort see i think you're getting soft did you know that because already you always know me is getting soft not one [ __ ] bit i'll tell you gordon that my goal is to produce me that you are not going to moan about that you're going to be proud of you're going to say janet you did a good job yes that's why i'm doing it you look great by the way yes you've been definitely rambling a lot you look free-range and wonderful ladies good evening how was your main course very good very good especially with the peppers as well that was gorgeous fine flavors when's the big day when's the wedding you got your time you've got your suit you're ready i'm ready to come back the flavors and everything just literally just really subtle but they all come through together and it really really works and the presentation is perfect

it's it is worth it that was hard i'm wet do i look like a wet rag because i feel like one that was pretty stressful i've never felt heat like that i actually feel like i am in an oven rather than a kitchen it's insane coming up rock legend meatloaf tears it up in the recipe challenge it's a bag of frozen peas frozen corn that's disgusting [Music] [Applause] right welcome back to effort now time for the part of the show while i take them assembly and beat them at their favorite dish tonight's challenger is mr loaf meatloaf i just wondered if this is part of the show are you ready to cook i

okay and there's the dishes evolved over the years or something that you've had yourself yeah it involved it evolved last night actually yeah i've been watching you i've been watching you no what am i distracting you in any way i'm doing something very very similar i'm gonna do like a tuna pepper art finished with some really nice breadcrumbs and then baked in the oven my secret ingredient is this a chorizo sausage to give it some heat and more importantly give a really nice color you're boiling celery that's right disgusting you grew up in dallas i did what was the food like everything fried yup when i was a kid there was a commercial poor fat marvin can't wear levi's and that was me my name was marvin and i couldn't wear levi's and did that make you miserable as a child did that make you

in your career that you started eating healthily i don't know january no no since 89 89 yeah seriously is it true you used to be a vegetarian i was for 11 years did you change your name from meatloaf to nut loaf no that's a stupid thing to say gordon okay i'm going to start sweating off my peppers shallots garlic with this little baby here srijo slice it nice and thin so the oil comes out very very quickly and we're going to fry it off okay here we go sebagger frozen peas hold on a minute boiled celery frozen peas yeah and a secret ingredient that's right i'm wetting myself with excitement thank [ __ ] a blind taster i'm just going to quickly roast my vine tomatoes just straight into the pan now i have a bag of frozen corn really important to roast these peppers chorizo onions garlic give okay while you're doing that i'm going to do this right opening my bag of noodles now three or four tablespoons of sherry into the peppers and tomatoes and leave that to evaporate you've had an amazing career you know that pat over hell sell over 30 million records yeah but that's not near as good as you know how many contest uh cooking contests i've won with this recipe how many you didn't check that research out go on so cocky tuna in literally 30 seconds of the pattern flash fried then out to drain do you still party hard like an old-fashioned rocker are you getting a little bit deaf in your old age i said are you a little bit deaf yes yes as a matter of fact now what i've done so far as i boil celery peas corn and carrots and now i put them all in a big saucepan with a little olive oil and i'm going to stir them around for a few minutes tomatoes have almost pureed down secret ingredient what is it meat come on nope not tell until after it's over what is that go away what that's not customer no don't get enough what is that macaroni cheese what is that ah he doesn't even know after he's tasted it that's wonderful it's so secret even i can't tell what it is it's so pasty yes i don't care anymore if i win i scored chopped tomatoes gone in roasted tomatoes gone in peppers and now we've got this really nice rich sort of pepperoni roasted garlic peppers shallots and tomatoes so flavour in there is wonderful but the oil out the sausage is giving this really nice dark rich taste harika beans in when are you gonna start that's fantastic seriously oh man i hear that yeah that's the best ever that's the best ever that's the best ever and i did it on tv so right pasta on top as well cheese i'm getting more excited serious peppers at the bottom tuna on top well see if your judges are looking for sophisticated taste they're going to go with you if they're looking for comfort food that they really would want to eat this is comfortable now i want to finish this with some bread crumbs parmesan and tomatoes i want the tomatoes to sort of roast and get really nice and crispy on top the end is i take my crisp the end is near i hope and i and i break them up like this see right on top are you ready for the oven yeah yeah top and bottom what would you like uh which uh i'm gonna have the middle oh [ __ ] me okay quick quick okay there okay okay good now they both go in there for 20 minutes we come back and meat loses [Laughter] jack and i have caught our very first salmon together yeah now for the best part smoking it at home [Music] to help i'm inviting an expert to london michael levesher makes award-winning salmon which he smokes to perfection in chimneys fitted with old wardrobes is all you need when building your own salmon smoker as long as you can get smoke in and keep it there you can hang your fish in just about anything i can't smoke the fish in the house as i'd stink the place out so michael's found me what he thinks is the perfect solution it's self-contained waterproof can live in my back garden and even has wheels [Music] what is that hello how are you tilly how are you yeah good are you well yes good to see you it's slightly shaken but also what a pile of [ __ ] oh my god oh no i'm baffled to have smoked salmon inside this we chose this because it's got a good floor area and there's enough space from the roof to the floor to get the salmon in to hang then we're just going to board it in put rails in we'll have the smoke and we'll pipe it in we'll put a chimney in it so we can vent it out unbelievable in the back now quickly let's go in here let's go to the shops oh jeez right we're off to clarity's for lunch here we go [Applause] [Music] having tried and tested our mobile smoking machine it's back to the job in hand before a salmon can be smoked it needs to be pin bone filleted and cured which removes the moisture and helps preserve the flesh so we're going to cure it with some rock salt sea salt sea salt and we're going to add any flavors to that you can add molasses you could say you can sweeten it add some herbs so at this stage you could put things like um dill yeah do a hot smoked salmon and we add thyme with that crucial we leave the skin on and the scale so that gives it a protection ready yeah but because if we took the skin off the fish will just fall to pieces and salt on top like loads of salt now when you look at it it looks like it's going to taste nothing but salt and then within minutes it's fascinating because it starts to get watery right it'll just it'll start drawing it out yeah curing will help keep the fish's color and give it a firmer texture so we'll cure that now for how long eight nine hours eight nine hours then after that we wash it off wash it off string it through the tail and hang it up dry good the salmon is left in salt whilst we turn this piece of junk into our very own smoker right let's go let's build a smoker we make a compartment from wood just about big enough to hang the salmon this will be a complete flat board on the bottom add a couple of curtain rails [Music] and a couple of holes to let the smoke in and the smoke out keep the fire separate to allow the salmon to smoke without heat and you've got yourself your own simple smoker [Music] brilliant the smoke will be made separately and cooled down before it gets into the car so as not to cook the fish so this is a cold dry smoking yeah this is cold smoking rather than hot smoking hot smoking is smoking and then roasting almost smoldering oak sawdust will burn slowly to create smoke that will give our salmon this wonderful flavor and that's the oat because it's quite sweet isn't it yeah it's almost caramelly so it's very delicate slow process yeah well it's just like you can't hurry it's you won't get the depth of flavor in the balance you'll get a superficial almost like a crust of smokiness we'll replace and re-light the sawdust twice in 24 hours just enough time to flavor the fish and how quick will that smoke go in there it's coming through already it's smoking yeah now it's ready for the fish jack ready to put the salmon in there yeah let's go with the smoker finished and the oak sawdust lit it's in with the salmon that jack and i caught in scotland the salmon jack scott is the one we caught and the one the girls have got was also caught that morning yeah filleted cured and now for the final process smoking it smells quite sweet doesn't it yeah okay just spread them out so they'd evenly that's brilliant 24 hours for us a mild flavor 24 hours from our flavor you want to be tasting salmon first and then the sweetness and the oak and the caramelly sort of flavor the smoke comes along the longer you smoke a fish like this the deeper the flavor we're leaving ours overnight [Music] the next day the ramsay boys smoked salmon is ready for the family verdict right ready for some smoked salmon yeah yes all night last night and then this morning wow look at the color of that who'd like a little taste first that is delicious that is amazing should we have some sandwiches yeah sour cream capers grate some lemon in there some chervil chop that up on there the smoked salmon goes on top mate that was a lot of hard work yeah but the results are worth it tilly there we go it's delicious caught gutted cured smoked and eaten hmm anyway we've all agreed mummy said that we can keep the robin reliant yes yes [Music] let's go guys work and talk at the same time stevie we can definitely get 50 out of 50 on this course yeah no burnt ones on there nice yeah good right steve they're well and truly [ __ ] yeah yeah again right time for dessert summer very midfoiling with lemon curd very nice some are very mild for it with lemon curd and milk foie basically means a thousand layers lemon curd sugar eggs lemon zest and then squeeze all that juice in there butter onto a low heat with and as it starts to come up to temperature the egg yolks thicken and now we're going to pass out all the zest [Music] beautiful cool milfoy bilo pastry egg whites and just brush across the fila pastry second layer on top egg wash finally our third layer of filler pastry take your cutter and push hard dust the plate with icing sugar at the bottom filler pastry on top of the plate and then dust on top hot pan clarified butter it doesn't burn as easy as a normal butter because all the fat in the water has been taken out into the butter it literally takes seconds out lemon curd as it's cooled down look it's thickened absolutely delicious lemon curd on the bottom of the plate to stop the fila pastry shaking around lemon curd on the disc first take your fruit top it with lemon curd and then another disc another teaspoon of lemon curd one more spoon [Applause] sit on top icing sugar and that has to be the perfect way of eating summer berries with lemon curd summer berry milfoily done steve yes i can't afford for you to burn any more yeah yes sir

right welcome back to the f word now time to find out if meatloaf is a sore loser excited ready oh there we go there's yours there let me carry it over for you because it's very very hard very much is that out of the way trust me i won't trip okay oh look at that oh look at that okay i like this bit look at that that's exactly what i was looking for look at that baby mine's perfect just what i wanted right now seriously before they got to get tasted okay okay i'm gonna tell you what's the secret ingredient please cream and chicken soup cream of chicken soup right where's the look at that belgian fighter pilot let's go um this is not gonna be hard for them to figure this one out thank you first one it's very homely yeah might be tomatoes i love the beans in there yeah the crust is a little bit dry though to be honest and you actually get a little bit too much of it it doesn't really add to it at all it's a little creamier sort of this yeah cherry creamy it looks very cheesy it's not as heavy as you would think but it's definitely cheesy i think the texture is quite thick though difficult to get down i prefer the one with the noodles the flavors are just lighter fresher it's just a tastier dish i prefer the one without the noodles i really like the use of the beans and it gives a really homey comfort food flavor i like the one with the noodles i just think the cheese and

long way my favorite bacon is traditional cured italian pancetta rich and strong in flavor it brings extra depth to salads stews and soups but a great cheap alternative is streaky bacon and it's what i'll be using for my thrifty lunch smoky bacon onions potatoes sweet corn it's amazing how cheap the ingredients are that go into this get your bacon and just cut into nice chunks i want these nice bite-sized pieces smoky chunky and just absolutely delicious it's almost like an american corn chowder potatoes give it starch thickness sweet corn gives it that glossy delicious flavor a couple of baileys they're always hanging around if they're not in your cupboard they're on someone's drive so ask to borrow them they are so powerful and it goes brilliantly well with the onions and the bacon bay leaves in a couple of potatoes it's incredible how far you can stretch something out especially when you bulk it with potatoes slice them and dice them nice and chunky soups are a fantastic way to use up leftover veg or meat that might otherwise go to waste and if you make it in bulk freeze it in individual portions and save on lunches throughout the week so you can see already how hearty and robust the soup is it's a delicious combination onions bacon potatoes and now some fresh leaks open up the leak into four give that a nice wash licks often have soil left in their tops so it's important to clean them thoroughly start sweating that down we haven't even got a corn in there yet and already it's looking and smelling incredible add salt but remember you've got bacon in there which is salty so proceed with caution really important to sweat those potatoes off i love getting that flavor from the smoky bacon in with the potatoes now once the leek is sweated off creamed corn a popular side dish in the states creamed corn is made from fresh frozen or even tinned corn cooked with onion butter and cream and can be bought ready made that starts to give the foundation the soup half the creamed corn add the sweet corn then your stock don't flood the soup just bring the stock to underneath the ingredients you can always add very difficult to take away homemade chicken stock is so cheap to make just boil up your roast chicken bones with a few fresh veg and freeze in batches for when you need it lighten the load with a touch of milk that gives a really nice bright color now bring that up to the ball turn it down and let it simmer for 12 to 15 minutes as it cooks slowly the starch thickens the soup the bacon renders and that leek onion starts to puree and the corn just shines okay next we're going to make the american cheese biscuits in the uk they're known as scones but in america they're called biscuits [Music] [Applause] first put plain flour into a sieve add baking powder and sift both into a bowl next add some salt pepper and grated mature cheddar cheese mix the dry ingredients then make it well in the center pour in double cream and gently combine with a wooden spoon turn your dough out onto a floured surface and knead for a few seconds only if you overwork it your cheese biscuits won't rise roll out your dough to about two centimetres thick and cut into four centimeter round biscuits [Applause] place well apart on a lined baking sheet and leave to rest on the tray for about 10 minutes then brush the top of each biscuit with melted butter and bake for about 30 minutes at 160 degrees c in a preheated oven when your cheese biscuits are well risen and a beautiful golden brown remove deliciously moorish served hot or cold time to dole out my thrifty lunch i always like to leave a soup to stand or rest it looks richer it gets rid of all the stock i like to have two thirds ingredient one third of the stock so it looks like a nice delicious chunky soup into the bowl [Music] beautiful tin sweet corn a leek potato and some streaky bacon but it doesn't look like it's just coming out of a stalker but that is proper hearty food [Music] served with my american style cheese biscuits this thrifty lunch may have been made on a shoestring but without an ounce of compromise on freshness and flavor [Music] the secret of a great hash brown are the potatoes i prefer using really nice waxy potatoes they cook better but more importantly hold themselves together we're not gonna slice the onion all the potatoes but we're actually going to grate them the potatoes get really nice and crispy i mean seriously crispy now the onion that way you get that nice balance of the onion flavor running through every little shard of potato [Music] season with salt pepper olive oil and km give that a really good mix through and then squeeze all that water out and look at all that juice we squeeze out there really important the more liquid you remove the crispier your hash browns will be nice large pan put that on once the pan is hot pour in a good glug of olive oil [Music] that sound confirms how important it is to have your pan nice and hot so seals the grated potato onion together so take the spoon and just pat it down what we're trying to do now is get it really nice and compact go around the outside of the pan with little flecks of butter you just slip them down the back gently and that gets the onions caramelised here's a great tip for turning your hash browns over quick and easy take a plate place it on top and just flip it over and then slide it back in very quickly you see the color we've got on there now got that nice crispy texture of the potato i'm going to use the hash brown as a bed for my baked eggs crack in your eggs nice and gently just a little sprinkling of the cayenne to make the eggs a little bit spicy then into a preheated oven for six to eight minutes meanwhile onto my bacon and i'm giving it a classic american twist now one thing i could never get my head around when i first started eating lots of american breakfast was the sweetness from the bacon i've grown up to love that combination of smoky sweet flavors and it's so easy pan on and simply heat olive oil brown sugar salt and pepper and butter bacon in and as it cooks it becomes irresistibly caramelized and golden brown toaster gas and my glazed bacon absolutely ready beautiful now my hash browns and baked eggs are ready at that beautiful just put your spatula underneath there onto your plate and that bacon sets beauty on top of the baked eggs and that hash brown underneath and you can see why the best breakfasts in the world are always in america this is an all-american superhero offer breakfast eggs bait in hash browns with glazed bacon [Music]

If you liked this clip check out the...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, [Music] chilis are a fabulous ingredient and one of my absolute favorites is the chipotle chipotles begin life as a green jalapeno pepper the process of drying and smoking lends an intense smoky flavor to balance their spicy heat dried chipotles can be brought as a paste powder or whole which is how i'll be using them in my big bold lunch chilis come in all shapes and sizes and heats and are used throughout the world but if there's one cuisine that has really turned cooking them into an art form it's mexican they're experts at building layer upon layer flavoured with delicious chilies and spices so for my ultimate big and bold lunch spicy mexican soup it's hearty delicious robust but served with some tortillas and a wonderful salsa it's almost like a complete meal in one starting with some finely chopped red onions for my soup let's get some heat going early these are chipotle so they're smoky rich they don't come with any warning signal and these are seriously hot so be adventurous but beware a nice teaspoon of toasted cumin oregano dried now start frying off spices the heat you'll see the chilies start swelling up delicious garlic be quite generous on the oil because that helps to blow out the chili right now those onions and garlic are on fire we're going to balance the sort of heat from the chipotle with sugar turn up the heat and really start caramelizing that sugar and the chili gives off the most amazing aroma next fry up a tablespoon of tomato puree add a can of chopped tomatoes cooked kidney beans and vegetable or chicken stock to cover there's something quite exciting about big and bold flavors because in the restaurants you have to be somewhat controlled you can't go crazy so cooking these kind of dishes at home gives me that kind of release chilies particularly when they're dried continue to swell and release their heat as they're cooked so the longer you cook your dish the hotter it will be [Music] but it's not as powerful it needs to be yet and every five six seven eight minutes that's gonna get stronger hotter and more delicious bring that up to the ball and cook that out for 15 minutes whilst i allow the chilli heat to infuse i'm going to crack on with quick crunchy tortilla chips and a fabulously fresh and spicy tomato salsa known in mexico as pico de gallo start by finely dicing three ripe tomatoes one or two deceeded fresh jalapeno peppers and half a red onion then chop a good handful of fresh coriander add the juice from two limes salt and pepper and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil for the tortilla chips rub a little olive oil onto six large shop bought wheat wraps sprinkle with smoked paprika and gently massage in cut each wrap into triangles and spread them onto a baking tray bake for three to four minutes in a preheated oven 180 degrees until golden brown and leave to cool to complete my mexican lunch i need to finish my deliciously fragrant spicy soup the spice is there it is absolutely spot on now for the cooling down process the mexicans are brilliant at building layer upon layer of flavor with delicious chilies and spices but they're also experts at tempering their dishes with cooling ingredients like avocado sour cream and cheese that's why you can take that amount of chilli you've got a spoon of richness spice and all of a sudden avocados almost like a little fire blanket over those chilies to further counter the chilli heat mexicans use a rich tangy crumbly cheese but i'm sprinkling on lancashire which is a great british substitute and last but not least cooling fresh coriander one delicious spicy mexican soup serve that with your tortilla chips and your pico de gallo salsa a phenomenal blend of textures and layers and spice and creaminess big bold and delicious spicy mexican eggs this is a very classic mexican style brunch dish bold kick-ass flavors slice the chili seeds in garlic sliced nice and thinly a tablespoon of olive oil i'm a big fan of brunches and if you get it right a great brunch can see you right through to dinner now to start the sort of spicy fragrant tomato sauce get your cumin in there garlic chili roasted cumin red onions already sounds mexican once that starts getting really nice and crispy in with your tomatoes never embarrassed using good canned tomatoes i do all the time cooking at home now by reducing that you sort of come down to a delicious paste leave that to simmer next canned beans called black beans these are authentically mexican but cannellini beans or chickpeas will work just fine just rinse them a little bit of water that is beautiful turn off the gas and just let it absorb leaving the dense beans to luxuriate in the spicy tomato sauce will allow them to soften and soak up all the flavor next oil and season an oven-proof dish from my spicy egg brunch to baking i'll just get some of that oil round the outside take your corn tortillas slice them in half and then just stick them to the side these are a staple in mexico take one and place that in the center get your mix and place that on top of the tortilla spread that out nice and smoothly lift up those little flaps i want that crisp shell on the outside now your eggs and cheese get the base of the egg and just make a little hole in there and then crack the egg into there again use a little point put your egg in there one two three four five and one in the middle gently crack and get the egg to sit inside almost like it's a little dug out and then one for the center get a really nice rich delicious strong montgomery cheddar i want to grate the tortilla shell as well so get generous with it on the top i'm gonna season that with these little babies little chili flakes they're my little secret weapon and they're going to spice up that egg just salt a touch of pepper sip that in the oven to bake for eight to ten minutes and 180. [Music] [Applause] that smells incredible it's a little bit of coriander to finish it off and that for me is what brunch is all about let's go a fantastic fiery brunch to get your party started spicy mexican eggs and a crispy tortilla shell

fiery and irresistible spicy pancakes one of the secrets to good cooking is learning to use your imagination when it comes to brunches you don't have to stick to the old standbys these delicious spicy pancakes are really great alternative but more importantly so easy to do start off by toasting your cumin [Music] it's a dry roast basically non-stick pan just a touch of seasoning the salt helps to dry out the cumin even more and then fresh ginger slice them nice and thinly stack it back up and then just slice nice little thin slices in there and then keep that bunched up shake the chilli removing the seeds will prevent things getting too hot now garlic nice now add olive oil to your toasted cumin seeds and then with the garlic ginger and chili lovely and it feels strange when you talk about garlic for breakfast but the time i spent in india everybody was eating something savory for breakfast it was extraordinary into your bowl and set aside next the pancake filling add olive oil to a hot pan mustard seeds in now they'll start dancing the minute they hit the pan then finely slice an onion onions in a little teaspoon of turmeric sprinkle that in and look at the color an instant change leftover potatoes just slice them the smell is incredible potatoes in now spread the potatoes across the pan all the potatoes stained i want them sort of absorbing all that really nice turmeric actually like a sponge season those potatoes and it really helps to bring out the spice beautifully [Music] they're ready turn off the gas and let them sit there and absorb all those flavors back to the pancake batter add plain flour to your cooled garlic chili ginger and cumin seeds a touch of salt and pepper nothing worse than the bland pancake one whole egg milk hold the jug with one hand and whisk we have a secret to get that really nice smooth paste but whisking that egg first and brings it together and then you're milking don't put all the milk in because then you're gonna get a lumpy pancake mix and if you put less milk in it really helps it not going lumpy look at that milk here and the secret for me is to have a nice thin mix now just a little teaspoon of oil that helps to bring a nice crispy edge to the mixture now just taste it that's the texture pan on the larger the pan the better it helps to create a nice thin even surface i want that mix going all the way around the pan before you put the mixture into the pan make sure you give your pancake mix a really nice stir pan it's nice and hot turn down the gas a touch of olive oil in get that nice whisk with one hand pan to the mix in one and a half ladles and then roll it around which is really nice and thin i want to see the ginger the garlic that's what i'm looking for in there now back onto the heat it only starts to remove from the bottom of the pan and lifts itself up once it's cooked these little bubbles confirm that it's just starting to lift off the pan a little shake that releases it and then just shake it to the end and toss if you haven't got the confidence tossing then use a spatula and turn it over now that's exactly what i want that nice sort of crisp edge around the side the color on the pancake is so important now roll it around and just let it slide out beautifully now for the exciting part filling them take your potatoes just sort of have a really nice imaginary line and then just very carefully roll that nice and tightly tuck it underneath there pull it back and roll the delicious pancakes are ready to eat but with a simple dipping sauce there'll be a real treat just mix chopped coriander with natural yogurt that's really nice cooling agent sit there on the side and that for me is a great brunch delicious spicy pancakes amazing [Music] addition takes as much time to write on a blackboard as it does to cook chickpea cumin and spinach koftas with tahini dressing [Music] in a blender put tin chickpeas cumin seeds paprika and turmeric and blitz to a paste [Music] next wilt spinach in olive oil and chop finely then add to the chickpea mixture sprinkle in gram flour made from finely ground chickpeas then shape golf ball-sized chunks of the mixture using a spoon and rest in the fridge when ready to cook heat oil in a frying pan shallow fry the coppers until golden brown on all sides then rest them on kitchen paper to absorb any excess oil for an easy dipping sauce mix yogurt with a dollop of tahini and a squeeze of lemon and stir in freshly chopped coriander a mouth-watering dish that's perfect for sharing chickpea cumin and spinach coffees with tahini dressing time is chili chicken with ginger and coriander [Music] start by chopping chicken thighs into pieces now on with the marinade chop garlic ginger red chili and lemon juice [Music] in a pan toast coriander and cumin seeds to release their flavors grind and add to the chicken then pour over plain yogurt add turmeric and season mix and leave to marinate from 2 hours to overnight next fry chopped onions in olive oil then add chopped garlic and ginger ground coriander garam masala and turmeric tomato puree and butter next add the marinaded chicken and all the remaining marinade and cook until tender finally topped with coriander marinated for flavor and cooked in 20 minutes chili chicken with ginger and coriander a simple stress-free wonder to keep old dishes fresh and exciting it's great to get spicy my next recipe is a time-honored british classic but with addition of spices it's given a new lease of life fragrant spiced rice pudding i love cooking with spices but you don't have to just cook savory dishes using aromatics and spices across desserts takes your puddings to a completely different level first off our spices this is a fresh vanilla pod fragrant and packed full of flavor use the back of the knife and flatten it that removes all those little seeds off the skin of the vinegar pod take your knife slice down the middle and then when you open that up the smell is incredible take the tip of the knife and you scrape inside and look all those seeds dying to come out that is incredible there are thousands of seeds still ingrained to the pods so put them in to the casserole cardamom powerful spicy take two little pods place your knife on top and lightly crack them cracking the cardamom pods helps release all the amazing flavor cloves gives it that kind of aniseed flavour with a lot of depth one two three cinnamon stick snap and in just smelling that level of fragrance you can imagine what the rice pudding's gonna taste of turn on the heat lightly toast those spices just a couple of seconds and what's going to happen is just going to sort of enhance those spices in a way that it just draws out an even more powerful fragrance coconut milk in sugar two tablespoons milk and then a couple of tablespoons of cream bring it slowly to the boil to allow the flavours to infuse and this rice pudding reminds me of my time in india where i got really into that chai tea fragrance because it was just so delicious and so comforting take a lime in the lime just cuts through the richness of the coconut gives it that nice little bit of acidity goes fantastically well with the cinnamon and that fresh vanilla nice have a taste now let's go up to the boil give it a nice little clean around the outside and in with the rice use 200 grams of pudding rice don't wash it beforehand because the starch helps thicken the rice pudding in the oven and just turn that down to a light simmer and the pudding rice starts to open up and it absorbs all that coconut vanilla cardamom clove and cinnamon bring up to the bowl gently and cook it out three to five minutes boiling it rapidly the rice opens up and it goes into mush so we want to keep that nice texture that sort of fragrant rice pudding on a gentle simmer next a little luxury i want to show you how i take this simple delicious aromatic rice pudding to a completely different level here's what i do take two egg yolks separate them now give that a really nice whisk two nice tablespoons of mascarpone cheese whisk that into the egg yolks just to it's nice and smooth it's almost like finishing the rice pudding in a delicious custard turn off the gas add that into the rice pudding what happens it starts to enrich and really thicken this rice pudding and takes it to a completely different level the rice is still not cooked it's starting to go nice and soft you can just see how it's opening up but looks like rich aromatic lava bubbling away finally great more citrus zest the lime on top roasted caramelized lime zest on top of a rice pudding is phenomenal then put it in the oven for 15 minutes at 200 degrees to finish cooking the rice and develop the intensely aromatic flavors look at that an incredibly fragrant rice pudding how beautiful is that look spices are a brilliant way of helping classic dishes come alive i'll guarantee you'll never ever have had a rice pudding like this before you

they're gonna be my number one brigade okay starter angel hair pasta with clams now the most important thing about these dams uh highly seasonal yeah absolutely delicious what we've got to save is the

moving in two minutes time yes you're here to cook not to eat jesus christ okay good luck yes i know what a [ __ ] table five four right so two little balls of pasta per portion yes so can we put them together yeah absolutely make sure the water's boiling rapidly first though yes good smell so far you've eaten more than you served mary okay you with me i'm with you too much garlic on it too much garlic oh [ __ ] me it tastes alright to me are they are they cooked now yeah good good good good i've wrapped my finger already thing stop eating it i'm eating it really good yeah less garlic i know you're french but let's garlic yes table five please go pop it off please mine's done i need a plate so four more as quick as you can yeah let's see what jenna street farm has been up to this week in a quiet corner of the yorkshire dales the piece has been shattered yes [Music] janet street porter's on a mission to get us all eating british veal janet's veal calves are now two months old they're getting through 13 liters of milk each a day and like all young males her balls are getting thirsty and frisky come on get on the case fighting over one bucket i can't believe this one look at him just that total bully but feel has an image problem i'm on the wall path again and i want to get british feel back on the menu i want to tell people that the images of the ill treatment of animals are not only inaccurate that they're just plain history many people don't know that they can buy cruelty-free british roseville rather than farmville that can be intensively reared it's actually great to eat it and it's perfectly humane to rear it even in this rural yorkshire village there are very few who actually eat it meal no way wow i have never eaten veal being a lot of who are about it aren't it you know my dad's a butcher and he doesn't sell meal that i want to eat it janet is determined to educate people about this fantastic and under-appreciated meat [Music] she's starting at grassroots with the next generation of meat-eaters hello don't look frightened as ever janet decides to go for the gentle approach in a few months time they're going to go to the slaughterhouse and we're going to slaughter them and then we're going to eat them [Music] around half a million bull calves are born each year as a byproduct of the dairy industry because they're boys they can't make milk it's their only use is to be eaten because we don't eat much british veal many bull cars get shipped off on long journeys to europe i've bought them so they're growing up here in nidadale yeah you like it don't you do you want to stroke them come on in that one he's so nice there's aren't you anything left [Laughter] [Applause] it's really important for kids to know where their meat comes from if janet can get this lot interested in veal perhaps their parents will start cooking it at home do they have good shelter yes i bet you the size of their room their living room is bigger than most of ours do they make milk no they don't if they were clever enough to make milk they wouldn't be slaughtered they would be cats because we all want milk all right they poo and they've stopped having the runs now stopped having diarrhoea all the time not very nice but they did wipe their bottoms on the wall [Laughter] well thanks very much if you all enjoyed meeting them yeah bye bye looks like she's got the local kids on side but janet's not going to stop there not until everyone's heard a message loud and clear shut up we're not bloody well there yet right hello and [ __ ] famous good girl head off is

were they they were very nice very flavorful well sometimes as they um open and then sometimes they're attracted and closed as well so it's not because they're off or they're stale but we shouldn't have certain clothes spotted there really sorry i hope you enjoyed the main course thanks good to see you it's not that bad lovely really cooked well the parsley the garlic the chili the ancient pasta

oil now around here are you happy with that yeah good good very nice very very nice go take seven please let's go all right i've run nine marathons open 18 restaurants but i've never ever done anything as tough as this [Music] the royal marines are one of the world's elite fighting forces their training regime is grueling so they need all the energy they can get from the food they eat these recruits have been pushed to their absolute physical and mental limits i'm dying to find out what fuel actually keeps them going look at them they look absolutely hard as nails i'm meeting corporals ben slater and tim richards who served in iraq and afghanistan and are currently down in devon to train up the new recruits good to see you both these recruits train like maniacs and eat like horses but the food they're given is bland and boring it's the quality of the food that it's important recruits here for 32 weeks and they're going to the same meals day in day out it gets quite mundane i'm here to show them that simple healthy food with all the nutrition that they need can be tasty too but first they're going to teach me a lesson nervous head down and get on with it i'm going to join 20 recruits on the rugged terrain of woodbury common for today's exercise the endurance course so time-wise how long does it take to do this thing well if we can get off the tunnels course itself under 25 minutes yeah we'll be both happy the only problem is i'm running late as pti corporal reggie redrop lets me know go ramsay get down here move right ramsey you won't be pressed up she's late sorry how many please 100. later all the way down ramsay it's always that miserable first in the morning does your cracker smile [ __ ] me stand by three two one go i may be twice as old as these young recruits but there's no way i'm gonna let that affect my performance right let's have a good time here that ramsay yeah the recruits obviously find it hard i think he's going to find a special time there'll be times there where he will not want to carry on this course is all about endurance you run in teams of three and each man has to carry a sa-80 assault rifle and equipment weighing in at 32 pounds within minutes i was feeling the pain [Music] for breath we reached the sheep dip here's where that famous marines teamwork kicks in okay after a lung full of air i get to return the favor good effort grab your weapons [Music] a royal marine recruits daily intake is over four thousand calories a day nearly twice that of an average male beginning to understand why they need quite so much fuel utterly knackered we reach the smarty tubes and my heart sinks when i realise which one they're sending me through come round you get a move on hold everyone off for [ __ ] sake get him involved ramsey move your ass time's sticking on without the feed and all that think about them become motivation let's go down all your weapons ramsay gonna move on well they gotta keep it going man you're not getting yourself stuck in that time aren't you oh there he is [Music] 34 minutes and three seconds ramsay that is shocking what they used to do lead boots i've not broken any records but at least i didn't come last that has to be the hardest course i've ever been on ever from marathons to double marathons you name it that was the longest 30 minutes my entire [ __ ] life yeah guys are amazing i mean that's what we call fit back to base to get into warm dry clothes then it's time for me to teach them a lesson in cooking these guys aren't fueling their body with the right food they've got no chance of getting through a day's training let alone 32 [ __ ] weeks what are you eating in the field we have 10 man russian pack breakfast sausage and beans sausage and beans very nice [ __ ] me look at that it's like inside a [ __ ] nappy holy crap prince harry was complaining about it recently on service in afghanistan yeah which i mean it's a far cry coming out of buckingham palace yeah you guys deserve better right we're going to do something uh exciting yeah spicy beef curry after putting meat to the test it's now my turn to give the orders for this substantial dish we're gonna use rump steak which is high in protein cut it in half and what we're gonna do now is get these really nice large cubes [Music] have you ever been out looked at the rations and just said [ __ ] that i'm not eating that yeah yes quite a cozy glass would take out their own stuff herbs spices tabasco take the taste off what you're eating [Music] marinade the beef and garam masala yoghurt olive oil and salt and pepper now we're going to chop the onions a whole lot the whole lot great fresh garlic and ginger over the onions i can think of the indigestion eating all those [ __ ] rations so ginger is a welcome spice add chilis sugar to help caramelise the onions followed by coriander cardamom and ground spice dry roasting will help intensify the flavor [Music] mix fennel coriander cumin and fenugreek seeds which are rich in dietary fiber and soothe the stomach quickly color the marinaded beef to seal in the flavors that's the noise i want to hear [Music] mixing the beef adding chopped tomatoes and tomato puree so the tomato paste goes in in place of any sort of cream of butter so it's a really nice healthy way of eating a spicy curry stock in that's a normal beef stock the spicy beef curry is then left to simmer before being served with rice a virtually fat and cholesterol-free slow-release energy source [Music] gentlemen come on guys is that it is it now i've got put a spice in yours yeah those [ __ ] press ups this morning do you want to spit in here already i'm sure these guys are half my age right yeah i didn't come last that's the most important are you happy yeah

we knew where everything was and we felt more confident maybe slightly i loved it it was good it was it felt easier this time around everything seems to just click and uh it's a rhythm almost i think it was great i was very surprised how well we pulled together next on the menu it's [ __ ] pitch black now i'm on night maneuvers in gloucestershire on the hunt for elvis the brigade cooker scrumptious apple tart with caramelised cream and i get to grill the former home secretary in the recipe challenge your current girlfriend is a doctor right do you enjoy her bedside manner rephrase that or i'll punch you now [Music] [Applause] welcome back to the f word time for the recipe challenge now we've always had blind tasters but tonight i've got a blind cook david blunter you look great by the way well you're a star as well what are you doing i'm doing um shepherd's pie now are you feeling confident less confident than i ever do in the out of commons or on the political stump so talk me through the recipe how's it gonna work the recipe is that i'm i'm chopping the carrots and then i'm gonna put those in yeah with the onions in a little bit of olive oil david's chopping is this one i'm gonna grate my vegetables i want to grate the vegetables first the carrots the onions and the garlic soda them off a little bit olive oil so they sort of thicken and almost puree which gives a really nice thick base to the shepherd's pie what's your favorite food what'd you enjoy eating i enjoy lamb which is why i've got shepherd's pie rather than cottage pie my mother would do necolam ready she did something called hash which actually was like an irish you're a lancashire pop were you a big fan of hash i was a great fan of that then you grew up and legalized it um thank you very much which is nothing nothing of the sort but we'll pass on that one i brought some herbs from my garden by the way i'm gonna chop rosemary and a bit of sage because i'm i'm you know really keen on sage right i'm gonna fry off my onions and my garlic in hot oil well i'm a bit behind you but don't worry i don't want to distract you you are distracting me i'm sorry you're a great distractor well that's part of the technique that's my secret absolutely huh right i've got fresh rosemary sweaty down with the vegetables that gives it a really nice earthy flavor right this is the dangerous bit for the fingers oh really yeah because i've got to get this mince in and i've got to make sure that it's in the pan and not all over the cooker okay a little bit of fresh thyme in with the mince well i'm doing the stock just putting a little bit of stock in it is a problem if you put too much yeah because it goes so soggy horrible well then you're definitely lose yes you're not nice you politicians are competitive come on yeah we we are in our own chef's office and what was the food like in the cabinet well we never really got fed the perks were a 16 hour day six and a half days a week when i was home secretary that's not even being a chef but well did you ever invite the cabinet round for a dinner party at home i did i'm gonna invite tony and sherry gordon and sarah oh nice they weren't all there that would have been a dinner to remember wouldn't it uh yes holy mackerel um now i'm just going to have a look at my recipe i've got it in braille were you amazed when you heard about john prescott's bulimia yes but we're all amazing people we never know anything about each other it looks as though i need to put my p's in okay peace all right um are you still in touch with tony i am indeed what's his favorite food what do you enjoy eating well actually they didn't they didn't eat all that well i mean they have takeaways and are you telling me tony blair is a big kebab fan he can afford to eat well but that's not the same thing as eating well no so there we go what about gordon brown he enjoys his food doesn't he gordon doesn't have time for food he's too busy for food i've added my mince to my vegetables because he lays the pan now a little bit of red wine give it some body more importantly some color reduce the red wine down and then add my stock bring it to the boil season it i'll be ready for the mashed potatoes i'm not putting wine no and firstly because i think it's just it's sacrilegious and second it actually flavors the meat too much i'm a chef so you're telling me now how to cook my [ __ ] shepherd's pie i like that 200 ml of chicken stock in bring it up to the ball and that will give it a really nice sort of rich flavor get it a little bit more savory with some worcester sauce i'm going to do henderson's relish because it's made in sheffield it's vegetarian and it's much better yeah it's not a relish though is it it's like a worcester sauce yeah yeah now crush potatoes egg yolks in that gives it a really nice richness to the top of the shepherd's pie and then grate some parmesan cheese in there this is where we differ because i'm not doing the egg yolk or the cheese spoon and spoon them on you see this dish yes same as yours is it yeah it is actually how the hell are we going to tell the difference your dish and my dish if i lose i'd swear we have dna you add mine okay we'll have a dna test on the shepherd's pie excellent right right you get your mints into the tray now i'm gonna ask you to put my potato of course i will i i would take about 10 minutes over it i i can really [ __ ] it up then and then i can wear it are you happy with the taste the potato yeah the potatoes are fine it's worked some sweden is that okay sweet now your um your current girlfriend is a doctor right my partner is a doctor lovely do you enjoy her bedside manner i uh rephrase that or i'll punch you in there how are you doing i'm just kidding oh that's all right are you fluffing it up a bit yeah yeah just to get a bit of air into it absolutely yeah okay davies is going on the top with a tray so it doesn't contaminate mine mine's going on the bottom 20 minutes yes david takes the dog for a walk comes back finds he's been voted out of my kitchen and loses now there are some ingredients you can buy and there are some you have to stay up all [ __ ] night for for most of the year the river 7 flows peacefully through 220 miles of british countryside until this happens the seven bore a phenomenal tidal wave that charges in from the north atlantic and carries with it one of the most mysterious and fascinating delicacies i've ever come across years ago elves used to be a poor man's food they literally cost 50p a pint and millions of them swept through the river seven every night now today's different story stocks are down by 98 and tonight i'll be lucky if i can [ __ ] catch two dozen elves or baby eels have a unique delicate flavor they taste like a lighter version of eel and have a slight sweetness like scallops and lobster they swim upstream at night to avoid predators so the only way to catch them is under the cover of dark i've enlisted the help of a local fisherman richard cook i've been a lot of searches yeah but not in the dark what the [ __ ] are we doing here tonight we're going to attempt to catch alvarez yeah baby or fry at the seventh yeah not possible during the day not during the day no no this is our only chance uh how long is it going to take to catch them well i think it'll be daybreak honestly yes i think throughout the whole night i think we will be here all night yeah serious yeah what in the [ __ ] is that it's like a bathtub on a stick holy crap huh that's what you're wielding tonight big net big catch right yeah i can't come back empty-handed you will not come back empty-handed elves can fetch up to 300 pounds per kilo so a very good night's catch can be worth several thousand pounds fishermen like richard have to take extreme care to keep their fishing spots secret due to an increasing number of illegal poachers trying to muscle in you know alvin's not all about you know it's not all about earning money no no no it's a way of life you know historically it was never perceived as a delicacy it was an important source of protein for poor people yeah the aristocracy owned and the landowners owned the salmon fishing and the sea tree fishing the poor own the alvin yeah absolutely she had to look forward to it yeah every year each and every year it's getting harder to find them more expensive to buy them elves are so rare that fishing them is controlled heavily by the environment agency i've been granted a license oh there's some in there gordon you've caught your first four hours four hours [ __ ] you now honestly i can't believe the size of the [ __ ] net for four small elves christ almighty these incredible creatures are carried in the gulf stream thousands of miles to the uk all the way from the north atlantic sargasso sea those that aren't caught will one day make an attempt at a return journey in order to breed [ __ ] you know this is a labor of love you know that well that's [ __ ] four more that's four plus five that's nine [ __ ] me they look like giant sperm just under an hour four basically 35 [ __ ] elves they're pretty gruesome in terms of uh look presentation flavor-wise they are [ __ ] delicious i'm catching so few elvis for my efforts thankfully richard gets a call from one of the network of his trusted friends also fishing out on the seven giving him details of a potential shoal further up the river that was the most fantastic spot no that was disappointing start yeah yeah half 12 at night so where are we going now we're going to go to an area called the stank the 8-week window for catching elvis is extremely small which explains why competition is fierce and information on where to catch them is kept secret this is like an undercover network here it is we all have people that we speak to it's like governed by the [ __ ] mafiosa it [ __ ] is are there areas where you won't fish on uh there are areas where i would be very nervous to go yeah serious i'm beginning to understand how territorial and competitive fishing for elvis is it's clear we're not the only ones receiving tip-offs so in order to divert unwanted attention we go know him dark don't know him now he's [ __ ] extraordinary this we've been followed now two of the vehicles coming on board is that because they think that we're going to a hot spot yeah we're catching they think there's fish down here so they're now following us [ __ ] you now right right here we go what we're going to do if we meet some [ __ ] muscle heads hey and if i'm on somebody else's patch yeah you're on your own jesus christ it's [ __ ] pitch black no huh do we say good evening to them over there or not no no don't say anything how's the fishing going guys oh say they're worse than chefs hey they don't talk to us [ __ ] hell that's not too bad though i mean i know it's a delicacy and yeah totally [ __ ] get it but jesus christ it's an

again time to call it a night don't you think what'd you reckon well 3 30. fair shot yeah four hours yeah for the amount of hard work that's gone into that it doesn't look like a lot but has a nice catch i've managed to net about 75 pounds worth just enough for a modest breakfast they're beautiful [Music] [Applause] [Music] right it's 26 in the morning and i'm now going to cook these little [ __ ] on toast for my fisherman are you hungry yeah okay elva's on toast chop the shallots nice and thin garlic it's really important when you cook elvis to get everything ready because they cook in literally seconds bread in season with salt and pepper add the shallot and a clove of garlic nice a piece of paper to drain this is where we make the flour mix to take the elvis to a different leaf powdered mustard cayenne pepper that gives a little bit of heat salt and pepper [Music] now the elbows are gonna have a little bath washing them through [Applause] oh look the dryer we get them the crisper they become elves have a wonderful texture and flavor and this coating will give them a crispy outside to complement the smoothness of the flesh [Music] the new little [ __ ] are going in the pan putting them straight into the pan is the quickest way of killing them frying like this ensures the elves keep their unique flavor very very quick parsley salt and pepper lemon and they literally take seconds for them bingo get your elbows on to the toast gentlemen six hours to catch 30 seconds to cook here we go yeah i'm gorgeous you can see why it's such a delicacy now can't he so same turns out then i'll call you right time for the dessert apple tart fiend with caramel ice cream this has to be the simplest and the most delicious dessert in britain today puff pastry cut prick it with a fork and this stops the pastry from bubbling up braeburn apples they don't hold lots of juice so therefore it doesn't make the tart soggy core peel slice layer [Music] butter sugar cover the apples completely and then straight into the oven 190 to caramelise beautiful a light dusting of icing sugar [Applause] [Music] blow torch and just lightly glaze those apples [Music] and then finally to the

of gravy in there yeah which i usually like yeah if i'm gonna eat a whole one i'd like it to go down quite easily yeah this is quite dense this one doesn't that's quite strong i think the meat's a lot chunkier in this new one without keys the red one and this one brings out so much more to that yeah there's a lot more flavor it brings out the cheese as well okay jose come in what's the vote well they both they liked it both they like them both well that's flattering isn't there what what the winner there cut the crap stop acting like a politician and get straight to the point all right it was a gordon yes i never heard that you obviously enjoyed the rich savory mints no for mr blankets it was actually the texture of the topping they liked they enjoyed david's topping yeah they didn't like my mints then but they like the texture they didn't like that they liked the texture so prefer david's top but they liked your bottom but wow ah there's no answer to it congratulations siri remember

If you liked this clip check out the...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, my all-time favorite shepherd's pie what's the secret behind a really good shepherd's pie i would think the vegetables you use and growing in it so we're going to use leeks and onions and they'll start browning off the mints you know no color no flavor i've never forgotten that you know that yep so good to have color gotta have color otherwise it puts that grey tinge on the shepherd's pie that looks greasy and cheap and nasty they don't want that julie and i know you don't do cheap or nasty let me clear your peelings now huh all right thank you very much there's no nails in there now is there no don't be cheeky i remember your amazing shepherd's pie and that lovely little restaurant used to work in sheep street in stratford so you never got food sent back no sometimes they complained that there were you never ever got a complaint no how long have you worked at that restaurant for six shoes six years oh hello chilly what are you cooking i'm gonna make okay i sort of modern version of nanny's shepherd's pie dad shouldn't manny be doing the cooking because she's the better cook excuse me right mum would you would you top our uh our onion please daddy yeah oh gosh your eyes are gonna water in there we've got a delicious steamed treacle and date pudding let's just separate it for you um how do skeletons call their friends how do skeletons call their phone i'm not too sure on the scalabone i'm just gonna tilly come on okay so two cats are in a race one is called one two three and the other is called under 12. who won depends who's the fastest cat one two three because under 12 cats sank [Music] oh goodness tells why do you make a nice cup of tea for nanny you want me to disappear thank you bye so give that a little fry off okay mm-hmm nice quarter these jokes they get worse oh she's only having a bit of fun sauce worcester sauce that's gonna give that really nice spicy seasoning oh thank you okay yeah tomato puree in you could put a ton of tomatoes in this if you want you could yeah put that mince back in there once it's drained i'm just going to put a little touch i know you'll go crazy at this a little touch of red wine really why the red wine well because i'm going to make it nice and rich okay produce the red wine down yeah and then start covering your with your stock now i'm gonna bring that up to the bowl okay and then get some fresh rosemary okay like it'll taste yes please is it hot it's a little bit hot be careful as it cooks out the wine and the alcohol will disappear it'll be delicious trust me now good spring onions we'll chop up and that's going to go through the mashed potatoes it's going to sit on top of that nicer i like that savory yeah delicious mince that's laced with all that red wine nice so sprinkles into there please mum and i'm going to drain off the potatoes hi there hello hello oh hi jack hi hi hello hello jack have a nice day school yeah yeah so we'll dry out those potatoes and then mash them no oh can i mash them would you okay um holly slice a little knob of butter in there for jack please so what was the restaurant you worked out there were you a chef cook i love the diplomacy were you a chef i was a cookie exactly that not really you used to help me as little right you kids do no potatoes these are nice and fluffy are they aren't they and do you want mom look delicious mashed potatoes yeah with no lumps in there hey weren't you getting it huh it's great having you back in the kitchen mommy now yeah seriously brings back good memories no just why'd you do that dad i just wanted to fork it to get it nice and spiky so i want that nice crispy topping and then lightly grate that cheddar cheese on top and that goes in the oven literally 20 minutes 180 minutes jack can you on the door please that looks lovely doesn't it even though you said you didn't like it earlier okay back in the day mama's meals all came with two veg and this is no different but with a modern twist braised peas and carrots with a fantastic homemade mint butter shepherd's pie glazed on top that looks lovely doesn't it and then the carrots that's why i didn't put carrots in let's put them on the side i'll see last job before serving pour that gorgeous butterscotch sauce over the pudding okay i'll take one at a time that smells incredible this is my ultimate childhood dinner shepherd's pie with crispy cheese champ topping sweet buttery peas and carrots that is the rib eye we've had that in the fridge not wrapped so it sort of almost air dries and it intensifies the flavor gross so much quicker and there's less water in the beef for me the only downside to perfect roast dinner is the fight about who washes up afterwards so meg and i are going to avoid that by cooking everything in one roasting tin starting with the spinach and mushroom stuffing [Music] a little bit of salt and pepper please here we go some of your left shoulder left shoulder thank you in with the garlic and the mushrooms to toss the pan you push down and pull back down and push back off you go take your time push it down and flip back good that's it push down nice that was lovely and again nice oh i'm gonna drop let's see well done well done well then right we're gonna sort of make a little well a little touch of butter in the middle now we need to start putting the spinach in the middle please so you can push that down spinach is cold so you're not gonna burn yourself be confident in the pan toss it and you'll see it wilting and disintegrating away wow who would have thought all that spinach could fit in this pan because it's a very delicate leaf it sort of cooks so quickly put this all on your board now and then i just want you to go and give that a nice chop then when you're confident with one hand we need to pick up the other knife the other hand chop it nicely good now outside and come in gently good regroup and take your time good mmm right i love that smell what is that lemon thyme lemon tan that's right so you get your little thyme stalks and you pour down you sort of strip lemon thyme in now tarragon taste brilliant with the beef fantastic with chicken and fish roughly chop the tarragon when i sprinkle the fresh breadcrumbs so the breadcrumbs almost sort of bring the stuffing together next we're gonna get an egg yolk now with the beef this is the exciting part slice with the bone and then come inside and go two thirds of the way down hold that open for daddy salt and pepper and then look we pack our stuffing in there this is amazing it's incredible now just gently hold that there like that okay yeah i'll see you tomorrow what tying string around the rib will keep it all together during roasting not too tight if we tie it too tightly what happens the stuffing will come out that's right that's ready for roasting but we're gonna protect it and sit it on a trivet so trivet basically is almost like a sort of little little bed a little bed that's right if you want to enjoy these delicious roast vegetables at their best make sure you remove them from the hot oven after 35 minutes and reheat before serving with your beef a little mix for the top a couple of teaspoons of mustard powder in salt a couple of tablespoons of olive oil mix that in i'm gonna pour my mustard powder over the beef so this forms a really nice glaze my one pot roast dinner goes into a hot oven 15 minutes at 230 degrees then down to 170 degrees for another two hours for a delicious twist on traditional yorkshire puds i'm going to lace mine with fresh horseradish [Music] start with plain white flour in a bowl and crack in the eggs adding only half of your milk at this stage makes it much easier to whisk all the lumps out and if like me you like your puddings a little lighter and crispier add a dribble of cold water and add salt to season when you're happy your batter is lump free whisk in the remaining milk peel and grate horseradish and add a handful to the mix we can leave the batter to rest while we get the meat from the oven that is beautiful and this is where you really need to let it rest how long would you say to rest it for um i like to rest the meat for at least 20 minutes just the right amount of time for us to whack up the oven and to get our yorkshire puddings in i love using the rich dripping but vegetable all is a healthier option to get the fluffiest yorkshires your tray and fat must be piping hot for best results take your jug of batter to the oven and pour the mixture in there it takes just 15 minutes for our yorkshire puds to puff themselves up and turn a delicious golden brown that up place that onto the board parsnips parrots you can see why we kept them in half they've got all that flavor one beautiful big slice for daddy one for maggie and then from the side the stuffing the stuffing the bit that's the best to die for now fantastic yorkshire they're amazing aren't they beautiful mm-hmm that's for you my daddy on that one that's for me beautiful roast beef with a twist wow [Music] i go fishing a lot and scotch eggs are the perfect all-in-one mini picnic breakfast first thing get your eggs cooked bring the water up the boil onto the spoon and lower them into the water that way they don't hit the water and crack four and a half minutes that'll keep the center nice and slightly runny now ground sausage meat i'm gonna make mine a little bit spicier i'm gonna crumble in black pudding that helps to season the scotch eggs inside a little touch of salt and pepper and then just to make it a little bit sweeter and a lot easier for the kids to eat some grated apple [Music] combine that blend in the apple and the black pudding eggs once they're cooked drain them and then run them under cold water cracking and cooling the eggs quickly will prevent the yolks turning gray tap them on the side of the pan put them back into the water and what happens the water seeps underneath the shell see the shelf come off so much easier eggs still slightly soft in the center i want that little bit of richness with the yolk next you need to get yourself organized with a mini assembly line seasoned flour a little egg wash and breadcrumbs take your mince golf ball size spread the pate manipulate with your thumb and then sit your egg in there and spread the sausage over the egg and you just seal that over it's really important to keep that nice even coating of sausage meat around the egg you don't want it too thick otherwise it gets too dense and it's unappetizing give them a light dusting in the seasoned flour if you don't put the flour on the egg wash won't stick and if you don't put the egg wash on the breadcrumbs won't stick into the egg roll it round shake off any excess egg wash and roll it into your breadcrumbs you can use this same three-stage method to breadcrumb anything you like from chicken guzons and fish fillets to fina schnitzel these are panko breadcrumbs japanese white breadcrumb so no crust you can experiment by adding flavours to your breadcrumbs like parmesan herbs or citrus zest i always like to push the actual breadcrumbs into the sausage meat so it gets that really nice golden brown and stops any of the outside burning once breadcrumbed lower the eggs carefully into a four centimetre deep bath of hot vegetable oil for 10 to 12 minutes the eggs are actually cooked soft and running the center so the objective is just to cook the sausage meat and the black pudding looks great don't they go and grenades there's something so magical about a scotch egg on a picnic because it's like this little mini breakfast beautiful drain them onto the paper roll them round just to get off any excess oil and then to transport them some greaseproof paper that for me is the perfect start to the fishing trip it's no wonder i never catch any fish because i'm always too busy eating my scotch eggs [Music] my ultimate black pudding lace scotch eggs an irresistibly delicious picnic breakfast you

uh what's called brill brill fish meet tonight's brigade mcfly heading the lineup of this band of brothers is keen home cook tom he'll be cooking with pizza lover harry and dougie the weakest cook in the group joining them in the kitchen is danny the joker of the pack let's see how funny he finds being in my kitchen tonight there's no support act these boys will have to crank it up in the kitchen if they're to get out a three-course dinner for 50 diners time for starter a sid b salad with pickled ginger this is a very um lean uh lightly marbled uh piece of beef it's quite sweet and the herbs help to counteract that so it's a really nice combination a crushed coriander salt pepper roll that round the coriander and cumin really nice combinations quite a strong sort of bitter flavor the reason why we um sear these off in the pan is to reduce the heat in the spices okay i said be very careful yeah 30 seconds as i tilt the pan it's just sort of rolling around sesame seeds at the end into the seeds and again let the tongs do all the work be sits there vinaigrette soy okay rice wine vinegar nice peanut oils come out what odd of that goes in is it doesn't matter because we're gonna mix it up this is a pickled ginger it's a really nice way of cutting transitions to the beef and give it a nice vibrant kick okay cress is very light and dainty yeah lightly dressed and just just spread these out nice big slices of beef we put the base on the bottom to give it a little bit of height mixed up the vinaigrette and then look bang just over okay so it's three little crucial steps

perfect drink to serve with the veal that janet's rearing for the f word restaurant rather than wine i'm going for a drink that's come back into fashion in a big way beer and i want to brew my own but first i've got to taste a variety of beers to work out which flavors complement the delicate taste of janet's veal i've come to the marquess tavern in north london to meet will beckett an expert in matching gourmet beers with food well how are you good thanks gordon good to see you can you beer is the new wine that's [ __ ] come on huh no no absolutely not doesn't know he doesn't have to replace wine but uh beer's got the whole range of flavor that that wine can do and it's just as good with food [Music] i'm going to cook some veal so i can get the best possible match little sprig of rosemary a little touch of garlic finding the right beer to drink with veal is going to be tough anything too strong or too bitter will overwhelm the delicate flavors of the meat i need something smooth not too gassy and something which doesn't have a strong aftertaste and there's yours there we are thank you very much excellent right here we go a little taste of veal right it's delicate it's tasty so i'm looking for something that can combine those flavors classic british beer madonna's favorite but she's a bloke anyway oh that's not right for you this is one of my favorite beers really really nice quite malty flavour color wise looks nice smells quite sweet see initially it's nice creamy light but then there's an aftertaste uh it's a stout so it's uh it's cheers that was one of the ones i thought you'd like i've got some ones that i don't think you like try this one see that's not too bad it's got quite a strong aftertaste trying to eat food with that level of bitterness at the back of your mouth as well it's a scottish beer aged in oak barrels [Applause] you're gonna get kind of vanilla and caramel on the nose you get that bit more sweetness you can smell the caramel on that that there's no aftertaste there's no bitterness honestly i mean how hard is that gonna be to replicate that the the key to this kind of beer is the aging process you need to find those those kind of barrels that is delicious it is i honestly didn't think we'd ever find that you know that we've done it cheers huh uh dougie i don't want that sweat pissing on my beef okay [ __ ] you now look at that do you sweat on stage like this oh i sweat like this seriously yeah jesus christ doug you keep your pan yeah in the middle of the stove you're not going to get any cup there okay okay so um we want um

to pay for the [ __ ] starters yeah stay down yeah we're gonna sign up for the next course yes delicious i'm sure they agree a lot better than the plate of lentils right absolutely yeah empty plates everywhere it's always a good sign the beef was really good it was really complimented by the sesame seeds and all the flavors and the oils lovely really nice out what you think you're sweating in 35 dishes okay let's find out damn the number of people paying for the starter it's 49 out of 50.

didn't spit in it health eating is a marathon not a sprint the london marathon is the moment when a nation of couch potatoes finally gets off his ass and tries to run off the flab it's a grueling run and to have any hope of finishing a good healthy diet is crucial preparing for the marathon is bloody hard work i should know i've done eight myself i've come to south london to help a guy who's been training for the marathon but not lost any weight [Music] in the mornings i'd have a bacon and egg sandwich during the day i'm snacking at chocolates and things like that i love thai takeaways they're my favorite lovely thank you very much my friends have been taking a piss out of me quite heavily for doing the marathon so i really would like some tips from gordon with only two weeks to go you should be in bloody good shape morning ben how you feeling yeah good two weeks to go indeed ready yep you're not ready first one yes indeed always the hardest i trust you've been eating well um not as

diet you're [ __ ] i'm pretty much [ __ ] yet but positive mental attitude i'll get through absolutely yeah i'm not going to quit yeah there is a big advantage there must be 72 takeaways along the way yeah especially through isle of dogs yeah probably yes let's go have you ever seen the movie run fat boy run come on i did uh two hours before yeah i was [ __ ] literally breathing out my [ __ ] ring i'm determined to show ben that healthy food can still be delicious it might even get him to the finish line come on ben jesus how he's going to pull someone off right i know you like curries yeah they're a big advocate of courage yes but did you realize down your street is this beautiful little market here oh thai market yes okay there's no reason you shouldn't be able to enjoy your favorite food asparagus you know literally 30 seconds in the pan very healthy as well cook it yourself rather than get it from a takeaway you'll know what's in it and can make sure it's healthy as well as tasty some really nice basil a cup of carrots p aubergines they are absolutely delicious i've never seen them before a combination between the slight bitterness of the aubergine but the texture of a pea here's a really nice way of making rice a little bit more exciting vibrant we'll steam it with some styronesis excellent right i recognize this man's face you're gonna be seeing him a lot more yes hopefully so thank you very much i didn't how long did it no quicker than getting a takeaway i'm here to show ben that he can enjoy his favorite foods but with less than half the calories this delicious yeah thai style stir-fry okay yeah 400 calories okay max cut the vegetables that's half the calories found in a takeaway equivalent and it's packed with all the slow release energy ben's

comes in at a commendable four hours and 54 minutes good lad [Applause] changing the way i've been eating is a big thing but also doing the marathon has given me a good kick off so hopefully i can be

fish in the pan listen to me now otherwise you're gonna go down yeah and harry we're falling behind now yeah i've asked for a five there's not even a [ __ ] pan on uh i know i'm doing the potatoes and i know that fish together okay do the fish you do the fish you do the fish no a pan for the fish yeah put it on all right all right get them out then quick yeah come on guys yeah okay now watch out harry i'm [ __ ] doing everything yeah you're doing [ __ ] all right i don't know what that is ridiculous i thought you were watching that [ __ ] it by the way same [ __ ] different days i'm doing jose what are you adding cold water on the beansport tom stop bang [ __ ] right back to beer i've been searching for the perfect beer to accompany janet's veal for the f word restaurant i eventually found a winner a beer from scotland which i'm going to use as the inspiration for my home brew there's no aftertaste there's no bitterness expert dougal sharp has come down from the highlands to show me how to brew it in my back garden uh the missy's gonna do it [ __ ] that when she sees the size of this barrel you know that she'll love it she'll love it and how many looks a bit like yeah yeah right that's gone i'm very excited about this i mean it looks like something out of [ __ ] charlie the chocolate factory yeah professor both for safe don't worry people think i'm brewing the kids or something when they're naughty this this is the key thing ninety percent of the flavor of our beer is from this barrel bourbon has been in the barrel first right uh and it takes out flavors that you wouldn't want in beer smell that they've got a little bit of citrusy notes in there yeah that's amazing sweet creamy very creamy and slightly apricot-y my brew will eventually rest in the bowel for 30 days and it will take on the smooth vanilla characters of the oak and bourbon so we've got a tank of water uh 80 80 degrees yep we're gonna mix that with these greens in this vessel that's mashing the first thing douglas instructs me to do is add salt to the hot water then add malt roasted barley and wheat malt incredible it's like a huge vat of porridge so we've got mash we just need to cover it up leave it for an hour cup of tea sounds good after an hour we are left with a wart which is a sweet water flavored by the grains super sweet great that is incredible ah that is absolutely an over next we mix in the first batch of hops which will add flavor aroma and a touch of bitterness to balance the sweetness of the malt you have a smell there completely unexpected smells incredible it's a bit like a pinot grigio this one it's a bit earthy yeah it's got a little bit of citrus character and it's your classic sort of british hop this mixture balls for an hour before we add some final hops for flavor jack arrives home just in time to give us a hand do you play football today rugby today drink any beer today all of you both surely quack quack quack [ __ ] yeah hold on a minute that's not nice and sweet yeah have a smell that one in there put your finger in there just see how black it is but it gets burnt inside [Music] a little wall paint right you ready to put these in in goes the second batch of hops it's a bit like adding herbs to food it's like a witch's potion when you stir it which is potion excuse me hey this is your dad's very own beer hobbs yeah yeah so does the thing be just put in that's right so do me a favor yeah pop it homework now the final step is to pump the mixture into the fermenter where we add live yeast which turns the sugars in the malt into alcohol so six to eight days in this yeah we're going to need to let it settle out a little bit and we'll transfer it to the oak and then it's just all natural six weeks from now it'll be ready to drink excellent should we bless the brew shall we bless the brew how do you bless it up north that's what this [ __ ] works [ __ ] it you've done it that's great how are we nice to see you how's it go we've never heard of it but it was fantastic it was a loveliest fish i've ever tasted actually yeah the idea of the tomato salsa was the sort of bacon effect a nice fresh tomato fondue over the grill which acts as a bit of a sauce but you can still taste the fish which was nice yeah oh without doubt i really really enjoyed the main course actually i particularly i mean you wouldn't have thought that like fish and mint and shallots would all go together because they're quite different flavors i actually thought they combined really well to make a really nice um really nice dish okay jose let's go how old do you think we did i'm praying for 25 to 30. 25 to 30. the results are 35 out of 50. not bad yeah but not very good it's no longer muck [ __ ] it's mediocre yes it was uh tough to concentrate obviously with the golden shout out and stuff but you kind of get used to it now i'm used to it and relax now in the kitchen atmosphere which is good while one thing's cooking you've got to be putting the other one on and it's just nuts but um hopefully we'll get it done for the dessert next on the menu has the mad cow finally cracked oh no it's disgusting scientists turn comedian ben miller struggles to get a reaction i think they can nucleate the uh they can nucleate your sponge oh [ __ ] are you still here and i find out who's the biggest tosser in mcfly [Applause] right welcome back to the effort now time for the recipe challenge and tonight's competitor is comedian ben miller excited very excited yeah i'm nervous what are you making victoria's sponge oh the reason i chose this clown is i thought it might be your weak point it is my weak point yeah i may be able to this is an old family recipe that actually came from my wife's grandmother here's the good news yeah all our blind tastes are from the wi yeah they're gonna love my old old-fashioned sponge right ben's making a traditional victoria sponge which is a [ __ ] worry um i'm gonna do a swiss roll i'm gonna use fresh vanilla seeds egg sugar whisk them up fold in the flour bake it roll it line it with some jam a little bit of creme de framboise and then mash some fresh raspberries in there and win what's in there i've got all my stuff you're such i'm not leaving anything to charge as well cause i thought you're gonna stitch me up you're gonna give me some [ __ ] equipment or something as you can see quite lightweight anodized very good at it look at you yeah yeah am i everyone's good enough for you no i have been testing them is that your that's my thermometer honestly that's your thumbnail it was five degrees out that's reading 150 this is 155. so preparation is everything you're weighing your eggs now as well look at you you're such a buffet you're right i am a scientist and i think this is also why i thought a baking might be to my strength whatever the weight of the eggs is i use exactly the same weight of flour caster sugar and butter so you're using an essence smell that fresh vanilla no i have used i have cooked with vanilla pods but i think so why not well i find them a little bit sticky and i think they can nucleate the uh they can nucleate your sponge you sound like [ __ ] hester blumenthal nucleate my sponge yeah exactly holy crap nucleating particles are um particles that um cause anisotropy in a in a fluid so say for example if you want to make a crystal oh [ __ ] oh how much you've been practicing a couple of evenings this week just just um just working on this this one recipe you know how competitive i am yeah you know that yes yeah i clearly hope you seriously think my hand is shaking look at this extraordinary from a tally to comedian struggling over a [ __ ] sponge ben get a grip man i don't really want to win man my uh alex justin you're okay with that yes yeah okay good just regulation 240 volts 13 yeah let's whisk away shall we yeah yeah whole eggs in vanilla pod in there as well and sugar in i'm going to whisk it up into a really nice light creamy texture now creaming up the butter and the caster sugar i want to get it almost white so what did you do before you got into comedy i was a physicist oh no wonder you're so meticulous to wear everything out whether you read um at cambridge and i stayed on i did a phd there as well in fact recently there's a lot happening in physics because they're building this particle accelerator in cern in switzerland about this it's an amazing experiment it's like 27 kilometer track that they fire particles around collide them into one another and they're going to recreate the big bang they're looking for something called the higgs particle which they also call the god particle which they think now fans seriously if you've got any jokes [Applause] i'm a chef you're still creaming [ __ ] i'm going to cream some more it's the fresh vanilla causing you problems uh right i've got mine into a really nice thick sabion now okay and that is light and aerated with a villain running through i'm gonna fall in the flour and then i'm gonna be ready for the oven i cream the butter and sugar together then i add in my eggs and uh the eggs have got the bit of vanilla essence i'm using rather than the uh i think possibly nucleating you know the pods i'm just folding in this flour um trying to do his little mixing as possible at this last stage so ben's using uh classic cake tins i'm using a tray because i'm gonna turn this into the most amazing swiss roll let's go come out the oven i'm gonna line it with jam almonds crushed raspberries i'm good to go are they are you good to go yeah thank god for that so both sponges are in the oven yes we come back and then ben loses [Laughter] nice smooth paces something with no lumps in there yeah right time for desserts the souffle pancakes

come down let's do double figures now yeah two fans on each tom two fans on each let's go come on doug keep it in the pan yes excellent stop that was hard here's the bird with a big mouth and janet street porter jamie and hugh have been banging on about free-range birds and intensive farming but neither of them have mentioned the healthiest bird of all ostrich it's healthy and delicious but do people actually want to eat it no no no no no you normally just see them in the zoos and you think they're meant to be there normal this tasty meat is a mystery to us brits what's it taste like is it like dick or anything like that there are 35 ostrich farms in the uk but no supermarkets are selling their meat i've come to kessie farm in the scottish borders to see if we're missing out on something huge hi walter hi johnny waltz has been running the family farm for 10 years supplying meat online and to specialist butchers and restaurants serving ostrich all over the country why should i eat ostrich on the health side it's low cholesterol low fat ostriches healthier meat and out they'll come i've come as two ostriches are joining the flock hello [Music] very elegant is this affection [Music] they might look funny but ostrich is the fastest bird on earth they can reach 43 miles an hour they really fly no they can't they can run around and they run in quite a bizarre manner where they're next straight and their body moves from side to side sounds a bit like me running everything's supersized oh my word even their eggs with each one the equivalent of 24 regular hens eggs waitrose that started selling ostrich eggs in 19 stores as a trial the shell on them seems incredibly hard it's very strong you should be able to stand in it all right if i stand on this egg and it breaks i don't want golden just call me a fat old cow walter are you sure can i have the other one standard right hold on right hold on right okay you can step away now oh no it's disgusting i can't wait to find out what these weird birds taste like now the next off it just looks like huge turkey doesn't it yes with 28 kilos of meat these big birds could feed over 100 people for dinner so this is the fillet um so why don't we cut your steak and then you can try and see what you think okay walter's aussie wife die is no stranger to ostrich and for once she's shunning the barbie in favor of a good old-fashioned british hob ostrich is really good at taking on fruit flavours we often just have it with a bit of you know red wine reduction or something like that ostrich cooks twice as fast as chicken lamb and beef it's full of iron whilst being extremely low in fat so it won't give you a big behind i've got to be careful not to overcook it that's actually the golden rule with ostrich i want mine rare okay so you can see it's just browning up all right i don't want mine cooked anymore okay well let's stick it on tight i only like straight rare i can't see the point of turning it into a finger so now i just took a bit of butter popping your berries nice blackberries or something like that a nice bit of plonk like that that's ready to go it's nice and rare oh yeah that's my rare steak get stuck in wow it tastes great it doesn't taste that gamey it's an incredibly tender red meat with a subtle flavor i can't believe people aren't queuing up to eat this delicious healthy meat if only people tried ostrich they'd love it so i've got a plan right who's first the janet street pool ostrich burger oh [ __ ] it's boiling i bet you thought you'd never say those words tell me what you think you've got much more meat in them than a regular hamburger oh look at the size of that absolutely do you like it what does it taste like it just tastes a bit like pork it's coming from down the road all right notice it's really nice it's got a nutty nutty flavor i wouldn't even go back and have another now she wants the second one the queue's enormous the people of beric on tweed would happily buy ostrich burgers if they could get their hands on them well my ostrich burgers have proved to be a smash hit with the people of berrycon tweed they loved it good to see you well yes you look great now one more thing about this week what is it i'll stretch me it's fantastic meat it's really high in iron low in fat and low in cholesterol that's incredibly tender it looks fantastic it's free range organic and if you want to eat red meat that's a brilliant alternative when you went to josh's family did you feel at home all those longer birds i did not gordon no no but they're quite fascinating characters aren't they they're individuals but i've got nothing in common with an australian thank you but they're pretty gobby aren't they they've got big mouths only make sounds and they're shagging trust you to know that that's a fascinating that is the largest edible egg i'd like you to stand on it oh come on i want to see if you're as heavy as i think you are i know you're always going on about your bloody nine marathons they tricked me into standing on this edge i heard you stood on one and it was impossible for anyone to smash one but however you managed come on so here's here's the weird thing okay a 350 pound ostrich okay okay you can sit on one without smashing it along comes janet at home with her ancestors and come on have you seriously okay have you have you honestly put a few pounds on your old age ready no i haven't right here we go 15 stone oh no you're looking at my shoe how could you do that hold on i tell you what you just ruined my [ __ ] shoes for god's sake woman look your very own hard-boiled arthritic with your very own soldiers look imagine taking that to bed in the morning look huh now have a little dunk [Laughter] i mean they are very rich aren't they hmm now um i've heard that it's very good for arthritis the ostrich oil in terms of yoga i know i haven't got arthritis you're building up to one of your jokes about my eyes the question is leading to do you know what every week you mentioned the fact that i'm a pensioner people in britain think i look [ __ ] great you're a benchmark for a pensioner really good to see you

carefully i will unbelievable ben thank you so much thank you yeah promise you won't come back i can't feel your back like a [ __ ] gas man [Laughter] you nucleating was really good and the pancake was just the right thickness and i think the weeb was just at the right level of tightness it wasn't too sweet and it went really well with the ice cream pancakes it's probably not something i've normally ordered because i'm not that keen on really about it i'd expect it to be a little bit stringy and maybe sale or something like that but it was actually really really nice really sweet i really enjoyed my pancakes i thought the pancake was nice and spongy um and the tartness of the rhubarb went really well with the sweetness of the ice cream so it was a really good combination okay results for desserts yes how about you that you've done the dessert i think we did pretty good yes let's go customers happy very yes enjoy the desserts some of them some of them have not i don't like the sound off okay the amount of customers have agreed yeah to pay is oh damn damn that is a big kick in the bollocks 31 out of 50. what why we had the size of the pancake too small too big too much food too much they complain about the size of the portions for five pounds oh my god i'm not impressed right okay well that's like disappointing yeah yeah i thought we would on that so the total for

thought you'd learn from your big brother's mistake medic please yes and mr gilmoreth they look beautiful yes really nice yeah well done let's go go table later huh now you're in the same position that roughly was in earlier starters yeah we're one man down yes yep let's go right this year i'm going to prove once and for all that healthy food can be delicious food tonight i'm kick-starting my campaign with a world-class athlete who should know better this is the poster boy for bad eating ricky hatton otherwise known as ricky fatten he may be a world champion athlete but his yo-yo dieting is legendary ricky piles on an average of two and a half stone after a fight incredibly in 2004 he lost a total of 12 stone the equivalent of his own body weight you know from going to excesses with eating to his body becoming you know a fighting machine really but when he's not boxing he's binging he does love his chinese he likes the spare ribs it is worrying what the yo-yo dieting is actually doing to his body i've come to ricky's local capital buddy box to see what one of the world's best boxers eats when he's not training god help us now this is a local hangout right it certainly is yeah this is where ricky hatton disappears and ricky fatten you know comes into shock ricky fatten where did that come from the press you nicknamed me ricky fathom and they said oh he's too out of shape he's not going to get fit in time and all this and all i've done is is kept proving them wrong do you indulge in the kind of sort of what it's like fast food junk as a treat is a treat i mean when you do a 14 weeks training camp your menu is like the same thing every day it's your protein shakes you know it's your green veg you're starting and you can't wait to finish it i wish i could find the happy medium as far as me eating is does that come with a heart bypass like most people ricky associates healthy food with boring food i'm going to prove to him that he can eat healthy all the time and it can be just as much of a treat as a fry up or a takeaway to help ricky eat better first i need to understand how hard he actually trains [Music] ah but don't [ __ ] miss i got work tomorrow [Laughter] [Laughter] jesus christ oh i feel sick um it's great now i've seen his world time for me to get my own back [Music] i'm cooking the dish that's incredibly low in fat but still bursting with flavor right when was last time in the kitchen well last night i didn't cook cool [ __ ] no you worked in the kitchen to be honest i've never really worked in the kitchen skinless chicken high in protein low in fat this soy and rice wine marinade will make it beautifully tender and full of flavor a touch of salt and pepper 10 minutes in there absolutely fine okay whilst i respect you're in training but you can make it a lot more flavoursome as well yeah yeah i used to be a fat chef yep just under 18 stirring that way bring some chicken stock up to the boil kombu seaweed adds flavor and it's rich in iron too a little bit of ginger ginger adds a spicy kick and it's great for digestion and circulation nice and thin the thinner the quicker it infuses hey thank [ __ ] you're quick in the gym see i need to get my own back hey 50 000 people shouting yeah cheering for it who do you listen to who can you hear in there i mean mum really yeah and i think just basically down to the fact that

marbles janna street pensioners facing up to motherhood every day can rain or shine she needs to bring fresh straw and feed up to the calves janet's trip to massage farmer craig's balls has given her a few ideas and now she's learned that some people even play music to relax their livestock massage time i've got some music you may or may not like it [Music] now there's a surprise clearly they weren't ready for that but are they ready for this [Music] [Applause] will janna's efforts at relaxing my calves pay off with great tasting meat we'll find out in two months time you're getting the full greatest hits next time you're [ __ ] miserable bastards those nails are too sharp so you you're stabbing me now jesus still is breaking down the lumps in your butt it's not lumps your toes you know turns no it's solid and you taste absolutely horrible right so how are my babies they are fine are they great i'm fine now i had a bit of a hiccup what happened i'm gonna be honest my sex life isn't that [ __ ] desperate one had got pneumonia called the vet out and he had to give him antibiotics he's okay now he could have died yeah so it was a bit heartbreaking you know yeah it's quite common there isn't carbs in it to catch pneumonia oh yeah yeah yeah yeah he's fine now he's caught he's smaller than elton yeah i know elton they are called david and elton and what does he call the mess because i got a phone call two summers ago from elton john to tell me he'd just taken delivery of a brand new puppy oh nice an ouncation and it was very very noisy and irritating so called it janet and he held the phone out and all i in bed every night please god make david and elton healthy relaxed and gorgeous me for uncle gordon i'm glad to hear it janet thank you yeah how are we good yeah nice to see you yes welcome right how was your lamb the meat itself was a really lovely bit of meat and i just think it was ruined because it was too salty the peas and the beans were quite salty as well oh really and everything was salty eats we don't add salt at home so that may be everything in your life is bland enjoy dessert there's definitely no salt in there yes good to see you yes thank you very much the vegetables were really well done the carrots with honey were lovely um but the lamb was overcooked and quite dry which really supported it for me right christian yes is that the hardest you ever worked that is the hardest thing i've ever done probably harder than sitting behind a desk and read the news welcome yeah yeah yeah right how well do you think you've done i don't think we've done well at all i don't think it's good but here's the thing both of you started arguing you know big brother syndrome little brother syndrome why have you got that competitive street in amongst you because i'm better than him i know i'm more successful he showed the boys up hands down nice surprise oh come on 18 out of 50. so you people requesting you that [ __ ] with a capital s yeah 18 out of 50 not good enough for dessert let's get 50 out of 50. yeah okay let's go that was so full on that is the most full-on cooking i have ever done i think i did quite well and lisa did very well i think the boys were a little unable to cope with the speed of doing things that was absolutely awful i hated every minute and i was about to punch krishnan by the end of it mom and my wife are still getting on ridiculously well and me and my brother are bickering away blaming each other next on the menu kate garroway tries to get into pole position in the recipe challenge who's had to go on the top of the bottom i want to go on top and run rabbit run i take my son jack to kill and cook bugs bunny which means it stinks it's delicious [Music] [Applause] right welcome back to the f-word now time for the recipe challenge and tonight's contender is kate galloway she's been up since 2 30 this morning so hopefully she's going to nod off and then lose the challenge are you ready i am what are you doing i'm doing bread and butter pudding which i think's a bit of a cough out because it's not actually that hard oh a very talented cook and this is your best dish by miles you're such a little minx that says i cook a lot i cook all the time i lure men by cooking but my husband says i did on false principles because i to cook them all the time we're dating and i don't really bother now so much because you know i just cook for my daughter now crust off for me otherwise i think it doesn't go all squishy okay i'm using brown bread i think brown bread is quite good kate's making a classic breadboard putting out a brown bread um i'm gonna do something with leftover panda chocolate cut them into sort of four or five little slices and then just a quick butter on one side you're really quick oh where's the recipe from mum mum mum very much mum and my grandma as well actually they've all done it i'm now buttering the bread really badly and now looks a little like a bit of a bit of a sort of overwash knicker down here to be honest it's so nice to see you because they're glamorous with the butcher's apron over that wonderful dress you look great thank you now it's rather sort of asymmetrical it's a little bit off-center you've got one in one outs this is what it's like this is actually a symmetrical top not the top of the apron my darling is amazing that's better right now they're both back in have you seriously been up to 2 30 this morning i have that's when i get up yeah i know it's totally early isn't it do you wake up derek that time in the morning or do you just go why not to because he gets really angry he's a bit like you i was gonna wake him are you seriously embarrassed to be married to a man with the name of derek it's funny but then when you get to the room it sort of suits you really it's kind of just you have to sleep in a separate bed no we're still we're still clinging on to uh sitting in the same bed how's the sex life 2 30 in the morning there's not a lot the other day i'm derek was saying there's not a lot of that time why am i talking about this i don't want to talk about he's fascinating you don't want to marry a morning person right that way if you're getting up at half too because there's not a lot of opportunity and you don't really want to talk or do anything but don't be romantic at that moment do you see what time's a good time for sex i was kind of watching i'd look at my look at my watch now and that would be quite good but right okay listen let me just oh you're distracting me with your that's awesome that's all i did everything now i'm using a really nice apricot jam i'm gonna put my epic jam at the bottom and on top yeah what are you using i'm using my mum's orange marmalade it's really strong ah did mom make it seriously she did make it honestly yes she did i'm gonna lie a little layer on the bottom who are you on the sofa this morning who are you with uh mr andrew castle andrew bless him do you prefer uh being with andrew or ben all right i'm both ready yeah yeah and is it true that you and fiona don't get on anymore what do you mean that's such nonsense though we've always got on and put a little bit of cinnamon in my custard as well i know i have cinnamon and mine actually people love the idea of a big cat fight between girls i often used to say that we used to like mud wrestle or something in the morning seriously well we should do shouldn't we don't you think because people would love it i would watch that sir i'll get up at 2 30 in the morning it would be great wouldn't it oh look you're just coming around to distract me even more it's looking [ __ ] great for me no don't don't let me stop something you need to do the nursery i'm feeling confident honestly so you're putting the figs in between i'm going to put a bit of fix and a bit of dried fruit in between and then a bit of sugar i've made a really nice cinnamon vanilla custard here at the bottom of my tray cinnamon brown sugar and golden raisins i don't know going on top because i don't want them burnt and the idea now is putting half of my custard in and soaking it through the pan of chocolate and then from there spreading some really nice apricot jam on the bottom that stops it from drying out and keeps the bread pudding nice and moist i'm going to pour this over now it's got eggs mixed up about four but i'm terrible for not measuring so i think it looks like it should be about full for the size of this dish extra thick cream that's it oh my god that's so lumpy jesus christ honestly it looks like something out [ __ ] a gmgb canteen holy crap even the cab drivers don't need that [ __ ] it's all about the taste it's all about the taste not a beauty [Laughter] with your mum's marmalade i'm so sorry i'm gonna finish one with a little touch of demerara sugar on top and then a little bit of cinnamon yes right just on top oh dear i'm so sorry mum would you like to go on the top of the bottom i want to go on top right get in there quick now they broke over the oven for 10 to 15 minutes to cook kate has a quick nap i'm going to wake her up and tell her she's lost now it's time for dessert it's a baglioni with peach puree slice hot pan water vanilla sugar blitz chill creme fraiche whisk basil into the fridge to firm up sebaglioni egg yolk sugar water peach schnapps whisk beat over boiling water [Music] chocolate and finish with a delicious longdeschat and their sex on a stem sebaglioni with peach puree done here's the thing yeah great start [ __ ]

from your wife then come on don't stand there and watch her vaseline please yes so talk to lisa who's putting this vaguely on who's going to put the pure in yeah um turn your mother off yeah you're a brave man i don't think she'll take her trust me you should leave that here on the table mrs grandmother you tell him ravi behave yourself right i've shown you how to cook rabbits here's how to catch them [Music] i'm with my son jack and we're on our first ever hunt for wild rabbits right ready rabbit is a fantastic wild british game farmers consider them pests but to me they're a highlight on any menu i'm hoping today jack will get to learn how to kill and gut his first bugs bunny which will cook together for him and his mates after football practice if we're quiet enough we might see some of the rabbits pop out the holes we're going to use the ultimate weapon one that's been used to catch rabbits for centuries ferrets ferrets do move quite quickly underground obviously they're they're the kings of underground that's what they're designed for yeah if you don't want to keep them in a box jack they take a long time they'll just keep their ferrets down their trousers so you're fancy trying that no i wouldn't they've got very sharp teeth veteran ferreters ben and guy have found a large rabbit warren and have been hard at work so we've covered nearly one uh probably 20 holes here 20 holes wow so they come out through the net and then we'll pick it up as quick as you can hold it by its back legs and just snap the head back and you'll feel the neck break oh ready yeah don't tell mommy okay okay now to business we've put night vision cameras in the burrow and attached a mini camera to the ferret the rabbit to the surface and into the nets at least that's the plan but bunnies are fast little buggers and they're hard to catch there's got to be rabbits somewhere down there there should be she's just got to find them at last a rabbit in sight we thought we'd covered all the holes but they've got emergency x's at the ready [Music] i can't help but swear i'm telling them oh [ __ ] [Music] that's it done jack's proved he can hunt with the best of them well done looks horrible but has he got the guts for this make a little cut with a sharp knife at the top so what we don't want to do is cut the guts open your hands in there you pull it out like that you know any of that and so the only thing left in there is a meat kidneys liver yeah sting which means it stinks it's delicious your little bugger right your turn here we go wallaby sleeves good boy good boy that's it that's it nice straight in there nice there you go hey you've now got a rabbit caught one now let's go and eat one shall we yeah let's go thanks back home it's almost time for jack's friends to come over for football practice to be followed by a meal of his first rabbit he's ever cooked first we're poaching a rabbit in chicken stock season with garlic and rosemary who's this little fella my old friend

pop that out smell what's that that is his kidney oh yeah [Music] who this can you eat we can eat everything you can turn the pepper please i'll put the salt we're just going to rub a little bit of olive oil on there and then jack what we do now is just rub that through there gamey flavors like rabbit go great in a ragu whilst the rabbit poaches we're making ours with pancetta carrots mushrooms and courgettes add a few layers of stock from the poaching rabbit and just enough time for a kick around [Music] ah it crossed the line referee come on luke oh hold on a minute oh jack let's finish the rabbit off that has poached now look at that little taste i can't stop eating it the poached rabbit just falls off the bone perfect for shredding into the ragu it's fit for any footballer nice okay guys let's go rabbit's ready right who's hungry smells delicious nice lovely who likes some more lovely to be honest i've been doing it so long that nothing about the news fazes me anymore it's probably a bit like you in the kitchen because if you know what has happened in the world chris and you know what you've got to tell people then you just tell them chris you phased me in the kitchen yeah yes yeah you got a whisk whether you've got to move big boy yes who's your favorite cook you are what are your mother oh [ __ ] what do you want to think i want the recipe for that you know that

both basil and peach was really unique and something i've never tried before now time for the recipe challenge results and the gmtv's kate garraway to l-o-s-e feeling confident never going to happen

ruin my [ __ ] night okay right jose obviously come back with the right result yes oh it sounds no it's quite crunchy isn't it definitely cinnamon if it turned up looking like that on my plate in a restaurant i don't think i'd be very good chocolate just seems clumps it's very crunchy it's still really soft looks a bit to me like scrambled egg it's a lot i'd say fluffier than the darker one i

Gordon Ramsay's Ultimate Fit Food/Healthy, Lean and Fit – http://po.st/REpVfP...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, we're creating bbq style beef brisket with crunchy coleslaw and sweet potato wedges which will be right up her street holly now you love barbecues right so gonna help me barbecue this delicious piece of brisket brisket look at it beautiful it's a very tough cut of meat so it needs to be cooked slowly so it gets really nice and tender are we barbecuing it outside we're gonna actually put the barbecue flavor on there but we're gonna cook it in the oven okay so mustard powder okay here we have some celery seed next a little bit of salt in there okay what's this here cumin two again nice good now this one cayenne pepper absolutely right right two teaspoons of that in there as well good now what i want you to do fresh pepper on there i'll give that a little mix roll up your little sleeves and then i want you to rub all that spice into the brisket almost like you're massaging it in there good girl come on holes get your hands nice and flat on there good girl now that's nice and coated okay in the spice so gas on roasting tray on what we've got to do now with all those spices is sear them in a couple of tablespoons of olive oil into the tray well done good that's getting nice and hot now you get your brisket and all that spice lay that in there nicely okay so now we'll start coloring it as you start to sear in you smell those spices yep all that spice left on the plate we're gonna use yeah i want you to get the onions nice and carefully slice them down not too thin but just like you're chopping them take your time smell those spices now good girl thank you wash my hands i can rub my eye damn holly was homework that bad no the onions oh no don't rub your eyes don't rub your eyes [Music] we've got the colour on the brisket okay yeah take that out literally for 30 seconds okay onions into the tray please nice you see it's starting to smell slightly barbecuey already give that a little stir nice now one nice tablespoon of brown sugar what does the brown sugar do for the brown sugar i'm gonna start caramelizing the onions right from there my bailey's in please good girl oh yes please right you want to take over good careful that tray is very very hot a tablespoon of tomato puree roast that off at the bottom of the tray to really rub it in amongst the onions good girl now look at the color of the onions right now time for a little drink for the brisket okay one bottle of beer in please so you go in you put yours in there i'll put mine here good uh good health to you and your brisket good health bring that to the ball okay now this is where it gets really exciting i want you to lift the brisket up and put it on top of the onions in she goes good girl and then i want you to pour the stock all the way around please i'm using beef stock but it will work with chicken stock or even vegetable stock once the stock has come to the boil cover tightly with foil and just pinch in the ends flatten that down and then you just twist all the way so that's nice and tight that's the hard work done thank you simply pop it in the oven for three and a half hours and as it cooks you can get on with the side dishes first job sweet potato wedges with some serious flavor start by making a spice mix in a dry pan toast coriander seeds until beautifully aromatic then put them in a pestle and mortar add salt and grind [Music] next smoked paprika dried oregano cayenne pepper and mix spice mix done now simply cut your sweet potatoes into wedges toss in olive oil and thoroughly cover with the spice mix onto a baking tray and into a preheated oven for 30 minutes turning halfway irresistible sweet potato wedgies are ready now to finish off my beef see that smell just sort of travels everywhere oh ah now look at that so we can leave that to rest what does resting mean resting means where you've cooked a joint and you just leave it to relax so it'll make the meat so much more tender okay right coleslaw traditionally you would mix slaw with what mayonnaise that's right mayonnaise this time we're gonna do it a little different so i'd like to put the yogurt into the bowl for me please all of it i'll start slicing the white cabbage and the red cabbage now from there a nice tablespoon of mustard in there please give that a nice mix up nice little touch of salt and pepper okay now a little cider vinegar so a little splash of cider vinegar in there okay as i shred this okay i'd like you please then to get the red cabbage and just open up into that and mix in at the same time and then you fold that in there as i start shredding see how it's coming together yeah right that's all the red cabbage now the white so you've got that nice vinegary tartness to the slaw and the yogurt keeps it nice and fresh nice little bit in one more little thing so put some nice chopped fresh chives in there and that will give you this nice light onion flavor so chives in [Music] how's that now taste it with the chives in there delicious so i would like you to fill up the bowl i'm going to very carefully lift out my brisket how comes it shrunk it's been in the oven for nearly three and a half hours so it's been cooked slowly that sits on there oh my goodness me let me just show you what this looks like i'll start slicing it and see how soft look at that and here's the thing about helping daddy cook here's the perk you get to taste it first before anybody that is so good that tastes delicious see all that wonderful flavor in there last job is to create an incredibly quick and delicious sauce gas on and reduce the spicy juices and onions the beef cooked in then add in cider vinegar and you've got a brilliant tangy barbecue sauce that smells nice doesn't it wow that is brisket and a half now the rest of it you can go in the gravy pot that's a really nice rich spicy barbecue onion gravy that my darling is the perfect way to serve

mustard dumplings [Music] and helping in the kitchen is my youngest tilly [Music] tilly first things first i'd like you to season the stewing steak a nice spoon of flour mix yeah good girl what's the flower going to do dad the flower helps to brown the beef our seasoned flour will also help to add flavor and thicken the stew i feel a bit like marshmallows they do feel a little bit marshmallow don't they look at the size of the chunks of the beef i'm going to cut my carrots literally be similar similar size that's right does that mean they'll cook equally that's right now these are little pearl onions i'm going to put them in hole as well everything has to stay the same otherwise it could burn oh we've seen burned garlic before oh matilda she promised you weren't going to mention that what is that time time and what are they bay leaves bailey's good girl tablespoon of oil in the beef goes in first okay in a really nice color got a beautiful color remember the carrots thyme in good girl garlic pearl onions in good give that a really good mix up [Music] daddy stews are very easy to make providing at the beginning to give it a little bit of love now that's all beautifully browned that bin that is beer and that's going to deglaze the pan adding beer or stout helps to tenderize the beef and give it a hearty delicious flavor and that's the only way i want you to taste beer in a stew yeah i'm going to add in a couple of teaspoons of tomato puree please in fact three please because it's so nice there's one final thing in there cover the steering state with the bee stock give that a little mix with daddy please wow that's really nice it's not even cooked yet do you keep all these vegetables in when you um serve it to be oh yes is the garlic going to be burnt no excuse me right and we always put the lid with a little bit just a little bit so it can breathe that's right not make the stew all watery into the oven at 150 please teals for about two and a half hours and now you can focus on your homework fun time to knock up two delicious hearty potato classics in one twice baked bubbling squid jacket potatoes start by baking large potatoes in a preheated oven at 180 degrees shred one third of your savoy cabbage and saute in butter and add a dash of water until tender [Music] after about half an hour your potatoes should be crisp on the outside and cook through in the middle slice them in half and scoop out the soft potato center then mash with a couple of knobs of butter mix in the cabbage and season to taste spoon this mixture back into your potato shells and into the oven for a further 10 minutes or until the tops are nice and crispy and golden two delicious hearty potato classics in one twice baked bubbling squeak jacket potatoes [Music] right homework done yep beef juice chewing stewing let's get on with our delicious hearty pet art i've been looking forward to this you and i chef i'm gonna prep the pears so if you peel i'll top and tail into quarters pears go soft in the oven very very quickly so we're going to put them on a tart you'll need to leave them whole half or in quarter what's that in there ginger that's right a stem ginger so you stem ginger and fresh ginger next add your stem ginger a little of the stem ginger syrup good girl and some brown sugar to your quartered pears and then just grab some fresh ginger off you go so it's a bit of a different one to grate this because it doesn't really come through like the cheese no i'm gonna make that a little bit zesty now we've got some lemons some lemon zest in there right what we need to do now is give that a nice little mix now this is a sweet pastry you can buy this stuff where you make it it's so easy to do so give me your finger that's my center point i want you to get the pears going around like that in a really nice circle it's difficult isn't it because the pairs keep on sliding all over the place yeah we've egg washed the outside and i'm going to show you a little trick so you lift that up so see egg wash acting like a bit of a glue that's right crimple this with our finger and the paste performs this nice little shelf like a little money bag are you going to do anything with the spare pears oh yeah you start building that up then you see we've got the fresh ginger and those nice little bits of stem ginger let me get round mike with your glue we might glue just on top tilly's last job is to give our tart a good dusting of icing sugar so that caramelizes it and colors the pears beautifully it's a bit like snow isn't it now that glaze is the pastry so the pastry has this really nice shine on there as well finally the lemon on top and then put that there 180 and in she goes you smell the beef smells delish wow it's even gone down a bit more hasn't it look at that i want you to just i was hoping you'd ask just have a little taste [Music] how's that taste now i'm not allowed anymore dumpling time flour in please i'm using self-raising

10 seconds to go nine eight seven six five four three two one all right here we go your turn for sugar let's go you see the secret to whisking vigorously is changing hands every ten seconds yep now i'm gonna start the chocolate i'll stir that up now the secret behind this is getting it really nice and thick and that's like established okay your turn come on change change again yeah of course also the chocolate leave that to slightly cool down a touch from there cream in why putting the cream in separately because i'm gonna get it nice and thick first if you start whisking that i'm gonna get in the vanilla to maximize the flavor from a vanilla bean cut the pot in half lengthways and scrape out those wonderfully aromatic seeds for extra flavor put the pod in as well but remember to take it out once it's infused so we've got three components the melted chocolate yes sugar yes and the eggs whipped up and the cream with the vanilla next mix in your melted chocolate with the sugar and egg saby on so you got a nice rich chocolate ganache smell how delicious i'm now i'm putting the cream and so you just whisk that in now look at that how gorgeous is that looking and that my son

mop up all that seasoning yeah into the pan and get that really nice and hot hello till guys kiss mmm kiss [Music] little bit of garlic and thyme in there cooking with these aromatic herbs and garlic

good girl well done table ten go right guys that's 18 minutes for the first table yes time for the ultimate deep sea delicacy urchins [Music] i'm hoping one of my favorite foods in the world can be found here on ireland's stunning west coast and what better way to see it that tip-toeing across the atlantic on a seaplane on your way to the shore the delicacy i'm looking for lies somewhere beneath these waters this is it the sea urchin its spines might make it look inedible but they hide a bright orange row that's rich creamy and amazing to eat i've never gone diving for oceans before and this must be the most exciting place in the world to do it the sea urchins are pretty much anywhere along the west coast the best chance of finding them is covering as much ground as possible and that means moving with a very fast rapid tide i must be [ __ ] mad i'll be looking for urchins on a drift dive in a strong current that will enable me to search as many of their hideouts as possible it's one of the fastest ways you can move underwater and ronan sweeney is the man making sure i don't drown i'm [ __ ] myself yeah no we're diving in this right absolutely i've never done a drift dive it sounds dangerous explain to me what it is please we're going to allow the the volume of water as the tide is falling to suck us out we're going to have a bit of a rummage see can we locate the urchins and see can we collect some down there's america i don't want to go back there for now trust me yeah so keep holding no problem i'll do my best i'll look after you our best chance to find the urchins is to wait until first light when visibility will be at its peak that's also when the rapid tide will be at its most powerful it's 7 30 in the morning and that now is the outward going tide it looks very turbulent very fast i'm going to be dropped in the middle of that the sea urchins are at the bottom i just wish it didn't look so [ __ ] cold in there the current is so strong here i'll be catapulted along the two miles of coast in just 15 minutes even the seals are struggling to keep up it's amazing how the boat's struggling to get through like that absolutely yeah point nerve wracking you're going to have a fantastic dive no i can't wait they're going to be on the edge with this one [Music] in three hours the fast-moving tide will change direction and charge back inland we could end up in the depths of the atlantic the time to search this spot for sea urchins is now [Music] in parts we were moving so fast it was almost impossible to see anything on the seabed [Music] the momentum is amazing you just pushed along at such a speed that it's almost impossible to hold on to the bottom always like you've got a speedboat on your ass the drift i've enabled me to search a long stretch of the coastline but surprisingly we found nothing and the strong tide was starting to run out of steam if i was going to find this delicious delicacy at all my only option was to look elsewhere my final chance the limestone at mcnish point makes this prime urchin territory or so i hoped you should have a fabulous start okay brilliant it's okay hopefully slightly [ __ ] slower [Music] i never thought for one second sea urchins would be so hard to find here [Music] we search for hours and are starting to run low on air [Music] and with just minutes left we found them [Music] i was soon back in as many as i could get my hands on [Music] that was a long [ __ ] journey for sea urchins i'm absolutely frozen bothered west coast of ireland stunning sea urchin jesus christ was that [ __ ] different would have gone to billings [Laughter] sea urchins are rarely eaten here but sushi chef saya nakano comes from japan where urchin sushi is an expensive much prized dish which is eaten by the shedload good morning how are you very well thank you local japanese chef now you're going to be making some sushi yes yes with the urchins and some rice and some we got there nori my take is on an irish breakfast cooking urchins with scrambled eggs but will the locals prefer to say a traditional sea urchin sushi little single you know living on a seabed these babies hand dive open up the sea urchin what are you doing with yours seaweed around yep and with a sea urchin on top i've just taken off the top from there you get the back of the teaspoon and just take them out so how did you cook the rice i cooked the rice in a japanese style season with vinegar eggs into the pan a tablespoon of creme fraiche a touch of salt and pepper fresh chives now fresh the urchins right at the very end sarah how are you doing very well quick taste wow beautiful huh beautiful nice scrambled eggs finished with fresh sea urchins fly away do you have sushi with a sea urchin it's beautiful isn't it it's a lot of flavor it's delicious the first time you see your chicken yeah this amazing local delicacy was a big attraction in hallway but which went down best with sea urchin sushi scrambled eggs yes do you like scrambled eggs like that the locals enjoyed both dishes but in the end my modern approach of urchins was scrambled egg came out on very nice very nice people called my punches i don't eat sushi for breakfast no no okay come on we've only sent two tables each who's doing what there i'm doing the next batch of potatoes asparagus for the next flight chef okay so why is anyone putting the asparagus potatoes on the plate letting those ones slice well i sliced but you'll have to move that over there which way am i going left or come on guys come on come on come on put the tray down there's no space there is [ __ ] space you make space there bang bang bang bang bang right burn potato not good enough yeah it's great now our favorite chef don't say delia don't say no yes not an idea that's just porn i catch dad watching about two in the morning dad's watching you just switch oh no i'm not expecting you around he's jamie oliver right he is the reason i started

animals the best way to get prime veal stock is at a cattle auction i'm not exactly uh genetically bred to care for things but first she's got to decide which calves she likes and how far she's willing to stretch for them she's gonna need some help oh my god you know i've never had any pets i once had two cats and i gave them away these are not pets they're food well yes they're not going to get emotionally attached to them the bottom line is dinner to me they all look exactly the same yeah they're black they're white they're sniffing well they've got big ears with yellow tags on how do i

wooden store around for tea yeah busy day at the avatar yeah extraordinary day here to help me cook up a family feast with some of the more unusual cuts the most amazing brains and the breads wow they are extraordinary it's a little while since i've cooked sheep's brains really so you've got the two different types of sweet bread something the long thin one obviously being the throat glands yep and they're the heart yeah look at them they're beautiful huh huh very tender seems really weird haven't taken them out myself this will certainly be the freshest set of brains i've ever worked really now do you think tana and the kids will eat sweet breads and brains tarnell definitely jack will definitely the girls i'm not too sure you know that good to have your garden back um it will be yeah when it's all done but uh i don't know it's really weird with it now as you start to miss him isn't it where is gavin now he's up in oxfordshire roaming around and having some fun has he still got his knackers yes so he can be a breeding round i think he's going to have a retirement what an extraordinary turn of fortunes for him i know bro i'm just going to quickly sweat off these um you're way ahead of me now onions no don't worry you give me a crumb job again i'm caramelizing my onions in muscovado sugar gives a really nice dark rich semi spice and then just gonna put some balsamic vinegar in there and just sort of caramelize them almost like an onion marmalade i'm gonna put mine in slowly i'm gonna color them slowly get nice and crispy and then they'll take about eight to ten minutes to cook okay look at that i'm gonna lightly approach i'm gonna pop them in now actually all i'm gonna do is saute the veg poach the brains and saute the brains and put the two together nice leave the cool down far off my garlic first slice the sweet breads up now they've cooled down just set nicely these brains nice it's like poaching an egg how lucky are the kids fried lamb brains and caramelized sweet breads with a marmalade of onion capers and vinegar you know what i was going to do just the lightest sprinkling of cider vinegar already on the brains themselves that is [ __ ] pretty right sit down two very exciting dishes hey hugh yours is it's uh brains with baby spring vegetables and mint mmm and this is throat glands and it's selling it so well it's sweet breads meg i'm not hungry sweet breads are absolutely delicious the brains um it's a very unusual texture very nice i did like it i prefer the braids yeah i've already had seconds hands up your deep brains again [Music] how about you dig a pond and get yourself a couple of crocodiles giraffes i thought it was lovely i thought it was presented very nicely and so many flavors coming through i really enjoyed it yeah why are we eating these things with legs and shells i'm sure it was happier in the thing that its flesh was already in and with this it can't even walk sideways i feel like i've insulted the chef who is the chef okay right ladies come over please results yes starters yes were they happy very happy yeah right give me here we go thank you okay the amount of customers they're happy to pay for their totalling of king crab out of 50 46. very good very very good well done what do you say too much pasta and not enough crab discs okay the best so far next on the menu the lancashire lassies go commando what and my very special shepherd's pie proves a problem for ricky gervais where's it gonna end you and jeremy clarkson in a helicopter shooting their cousins they're so tasty [Applause] welcome back to the f word time for the main course my lambs now i'm doing them two ways first up lego lamb leg of lamb the king of all joints sweet tender very rich and absolutely delicious a must-have for every dining table get your butcher to bone it out and butterfly it basically so you can tie it and roast it hot oven season olive oil mint use it in abundance it's fresh it's fragrant smells amazing goat's cheese the mint perfumes the inside of the lamb and the goat's cheese just sort of makes the center nice and creamy garlic roll [Music] first of all a big loop around the lamp that keeps it all in shape get a nice length of string tie a knot right at the very top underneath and leave it coming out here the secret of tying it this shape helps to cook it evenly and look beautiful rosemary season gets the skin really nice and crispy olive oil stops the string from burning so therefore it won't burst open while it's in the oven and bingo roast 35 minutes rest carve mint vinaigrette [Applause] [Music] that has confirmed it's definitely the king of roasts roast leg of lamb with ghost cheese and mint done now i'm nicely seasoned how long does this go in the oven part about 35 to 40 minutes right in yeah special lamb as you know it's going to be rested for literally the same time as it's cooked so it's nice and pink it'll keep warm while it's resting all the time absolutely definitely without a doubt so it's really important now to get some colour on the lamb yeah yeah okay up okay good tonight i'm serving the lamb two ways you've seen the leg and this is the nation's favorite [Music] shepherd's pie a great british classic absolutely delicious mints vegetables potatoes easy olive oil minced lamb a little bit of color on the mince and it gets rid of that unwanted fat there's nothing worse than a greasy shepherd's pie season great onion carrot garlic once the vegetables are grated in there they disintegrate and almost puree adding great flavor and that's the secret behind a really good shepherd's pie it's all in the mints what's the sauce tomato puree red wine thyme rosemary right now the red wine's evaporated chicken stock in and cook it out for three or four minutes no more than that [Music] potatoes mash season egg yolks [Music] now secret ingredient parmesan cheese be quite generous with the parmesan because that's what gets it really nice and golden brown [Applause] now deserves to sit on top of my mince [Applause] [Music] good old-fashioned tip just to keep my mom happy for the top 18 to 20 minutes in the oven beautiful [Applause] [Music] the crispy topping you can see what that deserves to be a great british classic shepherd's pie done 46 out of 50 for the starter try and get 50 out of 50 for the lamb yes yep tonight yeah it's all about perfection yeah let's do it out of respect for my lambs yes yes yes judith and susan five portions away please yeah yeah yeah let's go carrots take out and leave on the top there yes okay let's go ladies yes chef

command her anymore yeah but we just [Music] it's like a pair of curtains they're not knickers are they oh my god almighty oh now it's time for tribe a forgotten food that i personally want to put back on the menu it may look disgusting but i love a bit of tripe now it's very cheap very nutritious but sadly these days you've got to go through a hell of a lot of [ __ ] to get hold of it tripe is the lining of a cow's stomach it has been voted britain's least favorite food which i think is a waste in my grandparents day everyone ate tribe and i'm determined to put it back on the map i love tribe i grew up with tribe it's been in the family for years and having lived in france in italy that's all we used to eat for staff lunch was tribe i've managed to get my hands on some fresh cows guts and brought them to a tripe dresser before i can cook with them peter how are you likewise good to see you tomorrow man hey now it's down to you to turn into something some magical physical in 1900 there were 200 tribe dresses in britain your great great grandfather now there are only three and the smell i mean this place just stinks of tribe now what does the wife say when you get home uh she doesn't she doesn't she left she left all right peter and i boil my tripe to make it more tender look like you've been doing it for years and then bleach it to improve the color it's hard to believe that's the same try you know in terms of you know how palatable it looks now peter supplies bob and christine who run a traditional tribe stall at the market in akron and stanley hi buddy how are you good to see you well christine now you've been selling for how long their customers love tribes so much here they even eat it raw now uh how are you going to cook that what are you going to do with the tribe the whole one eat it as it did as it is with salt and vegetables and easy to find out who's actually buying bob's tribe i'm going to give him a hand on the store thank you oh that's nice and cozy in here now isn't it good morning madam you guys are trying my darling yes you know what you're gonna do with it vinegar yes a little bit of my madam how old are you please 91 on

just for a snack good man good man the fact that just been here for the last five minutes and watching you know the customers come and pick up the tripe how old they are and in a way that you know there's not enough youth eating it try it ladies is there anyone out there under the age of 30 who would like to buy some tribe tribes clearly got an image problem and many young people haven't even tried it so with bob's help i'm setting up my very own belly deli to reinvent it as a really tasty dish i like that yeah you like that dude gone's gut hut yes right and but what we're gonna do is something sort of modern okay so pan fried tribe yes with some lemon and parsley if we get it looking fresh and modern a lot more people are going to eat it right okay first of all chop some onions

more sort of um tangy and fresh you use vinegar don't you yeah i'm gonna grate some lemon on there yeah and what that does it just makes it a little bit sort of lighter fresher a little bit more

as they come out you serve the table go straight to johnny vegas yes yeah be careful johnny vegas doesn't eat you be very careful hands on here good girl off you go hey johnny enjoy [Music] marry me now it's time for janice reporter to sink her teeth into bernard matthews now as you all know i'm a little bit of a food snob and this kind of thing isn't something i'd normally eat frankly i'm surprised it's still on the shelves cheery norfolk farmer bernard matthews has had the smile wiped off his face by three huge food scandals first came turkey twizzlers bursting with so much saturated fats that many schools dropped them like a stone next came these horrifying images employees playing baseball with live turkeys and then just as you thought it couldn't get any worse one of his farms was hit by bird flu during the outbreak it emerged that bernard matthews that great british food institution actually uses large amounts of meat from hungary but does he tell you that on the packet like hell bernard matthews dinosaurs don't know where it's come from dinosaurs could have come from outer space bernard matthews jettas where they flown in from bernard matthews is in the middle of a massive rebranding exercise but being clear and honest about the country of origin is much more important than flashy logos or spin so it says turkey breast meat is often referred to as a superfood because it's naturally low in fat and cholesterol but where does it come from bernard after 21 packets i checked only two gave the country of origin of the meat well you might think that bernard's only doing what every other turkey producer does but you'd be wrong take a look at this lot sainsbury's fresh british turkey it tells you product of hungary clearly marked what's bernard's problem alberna's labeling isn't illegal but it is potentially misleading i think he's trading on his image as a norfolk farmer to make his customers think all his turkey is english but how does he do it simple it's all about the packaging all you have to do is make your product look english and not give any information about where the meat comes from i'm going to make a turkey pie using meat from brazil poland and hungary and see if i can convince people it's actually english so i've made the filling for my pie now i'm going to put the pastry on it and pop it in the oven here is my packaging turkey pie produced in england this is perfectly legal now all i've got to do is see if i can flog them hi there hello jenny can i persuade you to taste some of my uh turkey pie mmm lovely if i told you that the meat in that turkey pie comes from hungary poland and brazil yeah i'm not going to catch nothing am i the box is very misleading when you look at that box where do you think the meat and that pie comes from i would think it comes from england but if i put this box on the side it said meat from poland hungary and brazil would you buy it more than likely not where do you think it comes from turkey i think we consumers have a right to know where our meat comes from one person who agrees is david clarke from red tractor the uk's leading independent food assurance scheme if there's a red tractor on a piece of meat you can be a hundred percent sure it's british and carefully reared do you think it's important that when people buy food they know exactly where it's come from absolutely i mean that's why we have a clear statement of country of origin within the logo therefore the consumer cannot be confused i think what i'm going to do is uh go to mr matthews and ask him why he won't sign up for your retractor scheme i think that's a good idea i wrote to bernard matthews explaining my concerns asking him why he doesn't label where his meat comes from and demanding that he signs up to the red tractor scheme two weeks later here i am in central london i've been summoned to meet bernard matthews chief executive hi nice to meet you bernard doesn't get out much these days so he sent his right hand man to answer me i have threatened to serve bernard matthews with a food asbo and he'll be my second one now but after got a whole bag full of packaging here but i'm looking for where this turkey comes from we've not realized uh it's that important in fact we would welcome all of the origin of meat to come on because we'll find that we still are the vast majority of our stuff comes from the uk hang on a minute bart on the 5th of february bernard matthews company said all our turkeys are british or turkey eggs come from our hatchery and from our laying flocks which are ours in norfolk yeah so all our turkeys are now those eggs may go to hungary uh to be born but uh to be reared but the vast majority of all of our turkeys are in norfolk and uh when you say all our turkeys are british does that mean that the ones are in hungary their mum and dads are british certainly yeah but they're living in hungary yeah so they're hungarian turkeys the vast majority of our products come from the uk and we're going to very clearly signpost uh those products that are british and what we're doing on the back is we're going to take a lead on it and describe when products are british it'll be very clearly stated it's british and we've got agreement from red tractor so we can use that so you are going to put the red tractor sign starting when it will be by the beginning of september so when it says under branded map is it's going to be in here made from turkey from our own farms or from wherever else so that's promise yeah by september the 1st we'll get them on okay it's the deal hello janet hello gordon nice to see you my daddy you look great thank you i dressed up for clarity first of all congratulations yeah yeah i do feel a real sense of achievement made bernard matthews mr beautiful and eating his words well done i think they were scared of us that's a brilliant thing and what they agreed to do what what exactly well yeah they're going to sign up to the red tractor scheme so all the meat that they use that is bread on farms in the uk is going to have the red tractor and meat that comes from abroad is going to have the country of origin clearly labelled on the packet bloody good news so they're going to be far more honest which is fantastic how is he going to stick to what what's that he promised me that by september this year they will change their labeling on their packaging and if he doesn't stick to it what are you going to do to go out to norfolk and deep fries perky twizzler i will i'll go out there bloody well done i think you're scared more of you as opposed to the asbo you're not scared of me are you good beautiful i'm not scared you're taught my channel lipstick next on the menu will heavyweight johnny

Gordon Ramsay's Ultimate...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, my shopping mantra is simple first rely on your senses make sure whatever you're buying that it looks smells and really feels good second is to recognize that knowledge is crucial the more you know personally about where your ingredients are from and how they produce the better so don't be scared ask lots of questions and learn [Music] and when it comes to buying potatoes a great ingredient if you're cooking on a budget one green grocer who can always spot a duds bud is borough market royalty fred foster it's all about flavour it's all about choosing the right variety for the right fish he's been selling top quality veg for over 15 years and really knows he king edwards from his duke of yorks basically there's two types of potatoes there's early season and a main crop potato early season is basically round about may time you can't store them they cannot be stored you have to buy them and use them within two to three days when you're buying an early season potato you must avoid green looking potatoes at all costs it really is important and the way you can tell that is if you just brush the potato the skin comes off really really easy and then you want you want a yellowy or whitey looking potato the new seasoned potato is a superb potato to use new season types include rocket home guard and marist bard but my favorite is the classic jersey royal it has a delicate sweet flavor it's packed with vitamin c and is great in salads or simply boiled and mixed with olive oil and fresh mint jersey potatoes early crop are phenomenal look at that keep the skin on it's really important just wash it boil it it's a beautiful beautiful potato and that's what we're talking about we're talking about i know it's a potato i know it's a bit sad but we're talking about flavour right then what is a main crop potato it's the crop that is grown specifically for nine months of the year use when you're looking at a main crop potato you need to see that the eyes aren't too large because they tend to go right through the potato they've got to be firm it's very very important if a potato in any way feels a little bit soft discard it storage wise dark place cool place dry place and that will last until you eat it simple as that both early season and main crop potatoes come in two main types waxy and flowery waxy potatoes have a smooth dense flesh and because they're low in starch they stay firm when cooked types include anya and pink fur but i love charlotte which has an amazing buttery taste and a great sauteed in stews or serves whole with roast chicken floury potatoes have a fluffy dry texture when cooked which makes them great for mashing roasting or cutting into chips types include king edward whose smooth creamy flesh is perfect for potato gratins or with rich meats like beef and desiree which have an amazing red skin and are great for bacon or as delicious potato wedges old-fashioned types known as heritage potatoes are now widely available and have fantastic colors and distinctive tastes that are great when you want something different this one's called salad blue when you cut it you then see the most amazing color and it's perfect it looks stunning on the plate are really popular it's so important when you're going out to pick your potatoes you already know in advance what you're going to do with that potato so whether you're going to put it in a salad whether it's a masher or a chipper or even a baking potato each variety has a unique flavor fred's spot on whether new season main crop waxy or flowery potatoes are incredibly versatile and packed with great flavor the perfect ingredient when you're cooking on a budget well how much do i love potatoes well cook them simply proper flavors it doesn't get any better [Music] like all chefs for me there's nothing better than seasonal produce at its peak when fruit and veg is fresh in season and fantastically ripe i can't wait to get back in the kitchen to get the most out of your cooking always use ingredients in their prime for perfect boiled potatoes always start them off in cold water and never boiling water this way by the time the centers of the potatoes are cooked the outside won't be falling apart and when you're cooking potatoes always cook extra so there's leftovers they're fantastic to have on hand for making my delicious gnocchi and potato rusties for a classic bubbling squeak sweet pepper sauce with grilled prawns [Music] for the sauce in hot olive oil fry chopped garlic and diced bread [Music] then put them in a blender add chopped tomatoes blister the skin of red peppers under a hot grill intensifying the flavour leave to cool then they're easy to peel chop and add blitz add smoked paprika chili flakes and roughly chopped almonds a squeeze of lemon and a dash of sherry vinegar season blitz again and add olive oil [Music] this sauce keeps really well in the fridge and will intensify in flavor [Music] i love it with simple king prawns just add olive oil and griddle for two minutes on each side [Music] sweet pepper sauce with grilled prawns simply delicious making your enoki is so simple to do yet the results are absolutely stunning and it's a great way of using up leftover baked potatoes you can make gnocchi just with flour and eggs however the potato gives it that nice light sort of creamy fluffy texture cut them in half take your spoon and scoop the inside of those potatoes i'm using leftover baked potatoes but this really works as well with leftover ball potatoes two choices you can get a fork and sort of mash the potato and get it nice and light and fluffy or this little gadget it's called a ricer i suppose it's a posh word for a potato masher just squeeze gently you can see how nice and light it is almost like fluffy little strands of potato you can do this when the potatoes are hot it will go through the rices so much quicker just slice that off there now a nice spoon of okata ring a little touch of salt and pepper it's really important to season the mixture as we go along otherwise the nokia becomes really bland flour over the ricotta sieved so there's no lumps one delicious egg give that a little whisk now make a little well in the center you want a nice soft pliable ball of dough give that a really good mix get some thyme flowers in there and this time is light fragrant and it's just a really nice herb and with the ricotta it tastes brilliant just pick the little tips the time flowers next flour your hands generously and knead the mixture into a dough fold in and push and basically what it's doing is get it nice and smooth as it starts to get a little bit wet and just add a little touch of flour we want something really nice and soft now don't overwork it it stops the nokia from expanding when it hits the pan that's exactly what i want a nice sort of soft fragrant ball cut the ball in half lightly flour the hands and just roll it gently just think of a big long cigar the mixture will start getting a little bit sort of wetter but do not add lots of flour now lightly flour the knife so when you slice the gnocchi it doesn't stick cut the dough into bite-sized pieces just take your finger dip it in the flour and push down why i want my knocking to look like a pillow and for me the most important part there is that not one of them are identically the same shape water on bring up to the boil little touch of olive oil in there lightly flour your hand lift up the gnocchi in to the rolling boiling water turn that pan to stop them from sticking at the bottom and let them simmer and they start to sort of tell you they're cooked when they start floating get a pan on get that nice and hot now they're just starting to come up to the top and you can continue cooking them like that i like blanching them in the water taking them out and then frying them to study the gnocchi heat olive oil in a frying pan gently lift up and look they've doubled in size drain it get rid of the excess water and straight in to the hot pan [Music] this is where they start to take on a completely different texture nice crisp sauteed texture on the outside nokia loves fresh pepper so pepper in you can see as i start turning them got this really nice little sort of brown color and they're almost popping up now like little parcels so i want them nice and sauteed both sides but light and creamy in the center fresh garden peas in and the butter gives you that really nice sort of bernoulli flavor on the end beautiful put a

knickers let's go service please sorry to keep you waiting time to cook beans four [ __ ] times nothing to laugh about yes table egg let's go [Music] kangaroo they're sustainable and delicious but sadly no one wants to eat them because they're so [ __ ] ugly conga eels are monstrous creatures they can grow up to 10 foot long and can weigh up to 250 pounds thousands of them live in the sea around britain and it's a waste not to eat them i've come to exmouth to meet dave curley he's one of the few people i could find who fishes for congas and he sells it in his fish and chip shack tell me what when was the last time you got your haircut ah weeks ago right huh good luck duran duran huh these things are huge aren't there i mean it can be completely different to a freshwater reel related to the same family but they're i mean they're humongous yeah yeah i've seen hundreds a often live inside wrecks so we're heading out to sea to fish over one the fascinating thing about congregails yeah they look [ __ ] ugly they are ugly looking but you cut through that flesh and it's white gold it's just it is lovely and it just hasn't quite got the flavor of cod but you're gonna prove me wrong with that we'll be catching the congas with rods which is going to be a real challenge as they're very difficult to fish so it's going to be a slow tuck tug tug and then bang bang yeah what do you know they're on they're they're ferocious aren't they ah it's non-stop it is actually physically very tiring to get one up to the surface congas are tricky to catch because they live within the wreck they come out to take the bait and then nip back into hiding yeah oh he's got something on there damn fucker's gone just come off there damn i load up my hook with more bait and try again hold on they're fighting yeah this is definitely on here gordon is it oh it's gone oh [ __ ] why are they coming off so [ __ ] frequently it's frustrating but exciting at the same time he's on jesus christ they're so strong oh there is [Music] fantastic [ __ ] what size is that has casserole size i call it bloody hell that's not bad is it not bad at all no god they're so strong [ __ ] it we'll go absolutely right now yeah i think if you just jump them straight across there these buggers can really bite so the quickest and most humane way to kill them is to sever their spinal cord that's it that's it jesus christ you got him i think you got him bully base is one of my favorite french fish dishes but i want to create a british version using conga to show dave and his customers that this eel can be even more delicious so we'll season it first okay and start the process of a congaree or bulla bays yeah very similar to a classic french bully base but no grey mullet no monk fish no prawns no lobster just ears congo pure conga olive oil then add a little black pepper salt and saffron oil in skin side down into the pan and this one will start getting the vegetables going nice hot pan add some olive oil fennel carrots celery and styronese crush a whole garlic add a handful of shallots and lastly cayenne pepper that puts a little bit of heat inside the soup and really helps to season give a little stir from it please so we can take down we've got a color there that's all we wanted on there fishing but it smells amazing lovely just lays the pan with a little bit of pernod don't sit down set faster turn off the alcohol and mixing the vegetables yeah and the fish evenly add a splash of wine fish stock potatoes fresh tomatoes basil and parsley to finish the dish cook it out for 20 minutes and then we're going to blend it that's all right okay should we go yes look at them all fish and chips is off the menu yes [Music] we love conga it's so frustrating that we do not eat enough congoril so please start buying it because in there they clearly loved it it may be ugly but it's [ __ ] delicious thank you very much cat how are you i'm good how are you doing nice to see you nice to see you see you nice absolutely fabulous thank you i'm enjoying dinner i am you know so far yeah it's all good very good how long have you been late uh i've been out there for just under a year so i've um bought a house out there food wise what's it like out there what are you uh what are you eating on you know what i pretty much eat anything look you put weight on since the last time i saw you and maybe i have in a nice way no we're not enough your wife taught you nothing no no but i mean i'm not calling your father anything you look great you look great within a bit of weight on it's fantastic you know what i'm very lucky that i kind of don't have to worry about it too much please we are obsessed with food out there yeah but no one seems to drink which is terrible i order a glass of wine at lunch and it's like check out the alcohol i know check out the brit in the corner that's our second sip of wine but you still drink don't you yeah yes favorite drink oh well for me it's always champagne lovely girl's best friend well no it's just for me there's happiness in every bubble you know it's one of the ways there's a lot of bubbles in the glass champagne exactly as a country now we're the second largest drinkers of champagne outside france you are a font of image i don't know it's just it's all up there now jb right little challenge now yes um i've got a series of champagnes and i want you to taste them all and see if you can spot the difference between them this is not a test this is a really nice way of sort of you know understanding champagne better have a little taste second one [Music] i i i prefer that one because it's actually a bit more kind of bubbly and sparkling absolutely spot on because that is an expensive one tattensur the one you liked and that's a cheap sparkling wine yeah at 4.99 you spotted it straight away you know did i yeah because the most exciting thing about champagne it's got those tiny bubbles that rise from the base of the glass all the way up constantly and sparkling wine has a lot bigger bubbles and they disperse quicker literally yeah well done do you think it's fantastic so this is a vintage champagne and a non-vintage champagne oh god okay can you tell the difference a little bit more difficult obviously in terms of age um a completely different set of grapes i'm going to be pissed [Music] that one okay you're right they're both lovely absolutely lovely vintage and non-vintage now the big difference between vintage and non-video champagne is that vintage champagne is a lot stronger and richer in flavor complexity comes with age right number three is quite interesting this one okay yes now they're both champagne right horns are cheap brand and one's an expensive brand right it's really important not just to focus on label and by the label what do you think i definitely prefer that one uh why do you prefer this one because it's lighter and are you gonna call me cheap now so you preferred the cheap one i did prefer the cheap one so do i the own brands produced by the supermarkets often come out on top in competitive wine tastings it's nice now the secret of opening champagne is making sure it's open just with a little sort of whisper at the end okay no no no i like the pop it's the thing that signifies woohoo and just a small twist nice slowly and then just come to the end and just tilt the cork yeah right i'm gonna show you um a really exciting way of opening a bottle of champagne yes okay yes yes right this is nice to meet you hello this man is an expert an amazing expert and um opening wise a completely different way yes indeed indeed it's exciting so they started opening champagne like this napoleonic wars time yes the cavalry was sort of waiting to go into battle take a bottle out of the saddlebag and chop away if the french soldiers can do it i'm sure we can hear in the f word right ready saber on there never take it off the glass right slide it straight up and the way it flies slowly or fast quickly like that quickly like that yeah off again three two one [Applause] i think you have to have a go there you go sunday lunch will never be the same here we go right right yes oh so you lay the sword flat on there either way you just you just go up there with one two three and bang away you go am i doing it completely unreal just like that why not off we go one two three and we have to say to you oh in the name of noah father of the vine of saint vincent the painters individuals i hereby declare that you're a surprise of the conferee du

the way do you want your weapon back okay i'm left here on my own with bottles of champagne and a sword meat was delicious really well cooked um quite liking the little hazelnuts on the beans it's a bit of an interesting touch i'd say the duck was extremely well cooked in the sense that it's nice and tender still holding itself together and it tastes great right guys results of the main courses okay good right chris how do you think you did well i think we did well actually yeah i think we had a few hiccups yeah slow but good yeah yeah okay jb results 26 out of 50. guys disappointing that's not so good feedback from the customers what do they say so a bit slow and the green bean is a bit oily that was a vinaigrette it wasn't oily yeah greasy it was like a really nice hazelnut vinaigrette women hearts please tough customers out there tonight you're more than capable of getting 50 out of 50 for the dessert yeah don't be down and out come back next on the menu got one laser on a plate for me in the recipe challenge are you flirting with me absolutely i cook up the ultimate dinner party in under 30 minutes where's that [ __ ] gato in the bin and finally after wading through hundreds of audition tapes i've invited 50 female cooks to the restaurant tasted their dishes and soon i'll be choosing my favorites three of you are gonna show me who really is the best of the best welcome back to the f word time to find out who's got amazing taste and a sense of style in the kitchen and who is got wan ready you you bet your ass i'm ready no oh dear so my cook off with gordon i am doing a family recipe which is a prawn and chinese mushroom wonton in a soup noodle and it's all about the prep of chinese food it's not about the cooking time so dogs doing a wonton soup and i'm doing something very similar but i'm going to do a bit of a sort of wonton soup but mixed with a little bit of sort of hot and sour and then make some nice wontons but with some fresh garlic in there so we can just sort of glamorize it a little bit uh can i just say you've got bloody good knife skills there yeah a lot of time in the kitchen yes you know what my dad has been in catering all of his life and he's actually got a fish and chip shop in leicester now but really i was brought up in the kitchens and i was brought up in the restaurant and from a very early age yep dad was teaching us you know how to cook and how to look after the restaurant so okay it's a massive part of my life really after that's fantastic you have a fascinating background with food because when you're younger you used to be a little bit porky which i find hard to believe no but no hold on but yeah thank you i was a chunky monkey once i got up to just under 18 stone right okay six years ago just constantly eating not looking after myself and yeah yeah i find it hard to believe because you're you know you look good all my family are big still and you know and i was and i was 21 stone at my biggest weight and i'm not yeah i was a big guy you know i never had a really bad relationship with food no it's just that we were surrounded by and the chinese culture is anything you do whether it's a celebration a commiseration doesn't matter what you're doing eat meat alongside it so that i mean that was that was it really i'm gonna make the stop first these are uh prawn heads we're sweating off with some garlic some chili ginger lemongrass once i've made the stock i'm going to put the prawns back inside and poach the prawns inside the stock finish with the coriander noodles spring onions and some little beautiful bok choy got and what's in the pot now i'm going to make a stock out of the prawn heads and the tails because that's what's going to make most of the soup watching you work in the kitchen it's almost like watching a chef you know that huh oh really yeah but you know i like that you're attentive you're taking the [ __ ] out of the oh my god you know what i was just thinking when you were talking then this is the rankest job i would much rather be putting naked women on buildings than doing this i'm telling you guys you do have the most amazing job you are the luckiest man in the world i love my job i love clothes i love the idea of image you know and it's about making people feel good sure not changing them whatsoever not rocket science yeah it must be a huge turn on well you know what not really my bag i have to be honest um have you ever been sort of tempted to sort of change direction no do you know what i i love penises i mean i can't i'm not going to lie to you now i do you know i am gay i'm very very happy about i'm out to my family which is you know the biggest part of my life yeah more than anything else you know me liking guys has got absolutely nothing to do with my job whatsoever do you think they feel safer because well of course they do because i'm not trying to hump them and there's no you know there's no competition with them it's always yeah you know we do want a job and and that's yeah that's pretty much it isn't it okay i've got some ginger in there a little bit of garlic fresh scallop coriander and a little bit of lime juice i'm just gonna bind that together lightly season it and put it in between the wontons and then poach them off so what i've got so far then a little bit behind but it's fine i'm still gonna win i have the uh filling for my one tons which is basically the mashed up prawns bamboo shoots water chestnuts and the chinese mushrooms which is the very very good quality chinese mushrooms and you know what i have to say you are one of the gentlest nicest men i've ever met in my entire life you really are thank you are you flirting with me absolutely [ __ ] lutely i hear that you've got a little fair shouldn't you uh yellow what is going on with those [ __ ] cardigans jordan they are absolutely heinous can i just say you're swearing more than me terrible i swear to god i don't care i don't care honestly they're not they're bonfire food i'll dump the cardigans okay you know image and clothing it's got to be representative of who you are as a person right absolutely and the character you give off with your clothing yeah um to me it's a bit slowny a bit slowly i grew up in a counseling the thing is you give off fight impression that's what it looks like from a lot yeah from an unlocker and you know what you'd have a lot more knickers in the post if i saw it at your wall you're just trying to distract me now so you can win you know that without blaming your dad in case you lose what you're wearing now let me see oh no i just got uh chest trousers on shoulders exactly see how much money have you got and you're wearing chest trousers because i'm ashamed so just to make sure we maximise the flavor in this stock with these um heads or the prawns i'm gonna crush them now because inside that head is where all the flavor is do you know about noodles uh i love noodles these are just egg wonton noodles but nice consistency is just absolutely amazing oh this is really hard talking and cooking at the same time um right they've both got a simmer now for what 10-15 minutes yeah yes we come back but then you lose what [ __ ] ever now it's time for dessert baked alaska absolute classic everyone's heard of it but no one knows exactly what's inside basically layers of sponge ice cream

over i hope you're not wearing too much hairspray do you see the flowers oh my god it's a bit hard in the light but they're there i promise that's where he was there we go we got it going here thank you girl perfect however fast your life is there's always time for good homemade food dinner parties can be hell the pressure to perform well in the kitchen means menus are often safe or stuck in a time warp i tend to cook a three-course meal starts off with prawn cocktail spaghetti bolognese and then we tend to have a frozen dessert chocolate gato to cook a nice meal and be adventurous you need to have time to be able to do that and at the moment i just don't have the time to do that cow's been cooking like this for 13 years i'm here to show a dinner party menu that can be done in under 30 minutes dinner parties a [ __ ] chef's nightmare that looks like cat food in there what is that no this is spaghetti bolognese run me through the spag bowl spag bowl pasta yup spaghetti mince tomato run me through your bolognese sauce that is my bolognese sauce though what do you mean that's it the tin the jar sauce onions vegetables no onions vegetables garlic no straight onto the spaghetti 13 years carol three months fine but 13 years cooking the same old [ __ ] that let's start off with that in there go in there yeah we're gonna do three dishes salmon chicken and a cheesecake that can be done easily whilst you get ready and lay the table at the same time right first of all we're going to do the salmon it's on my menu at the restaurant perfect for summer very very light as a ladies dish so we'll get the marinade done first uh spring onions while you're doing that i'll chop the chili and the nice thing about this it can vary you know that you can put chopped ginger in there as you get a little bit more adventurous i'd like to think over the next 13 years that's exactly what you're going to do add finely chopped coriander the juice of one lemon olive oil sesame oil and soy sauce now that is the most difficult part done all right okay and it's quicker to do that than is make a prawn cocktail [Music] don't dress the salmon with the marinade yet put it in the fridge and start the main course chicken a simple dish with chicken creme fraiche and capers always go to the outside of the pan first that is really nice and hot that's it so everything will go in here so there's not any other pan that i need no we have one pan and one panel one pan for the husband to watch out when he gets home yeah when you've got colour on both sides add some white wine after two minutes take out the garlic and rosemary and put some capers in chicken stock creme fresh in bring it up to the ball and we need it happy with that straightforward so quick quicker than bolognese very quick the beauty of this chicken dish is that you can leave it to finish while you lay the table when was last time i made a cheesecake time for dessert and no baked cheesecake this is going to wipe the floor with the gatorade start creaming it for me please just squashing it in that cream in it right six tablespoons of sugar fresh vinegar three-quarter whipped cream just taste that now with the vinegar in there [Music] lovely add the vanilla cream to the cream cheese mix next creme de cassis a black currant liqueur i know you girls like alcohol so everyone thinks cheesecake has to be long-winded but look now where's that [ __ ] gato in the bin right look at you old lamb right this menu is so quick cows even had time to get changed before her guests arrive oh you finished them yeah and i'll get ladies in and sat down it's the prawn cocktail girls come in come in come in come in nice to see you wine in hand i see my darling oh jesus pissed already i wish take a seat huh twice it's like the calendar girls right take a seat now there's no prom cocktail there is there no that's not yeah i don't think they'll be upset do you better than normal oh ladies good to see you sorry

about all three dishes that you worked on it yeah i said to you get the idea and evolve it and i think you just did that so i made my decision the woman that i want to be my fanny is dessert next week yes yes well done oh okay big round yes let's go [Applause] next on the menu he may know how to look good naked but can got one beat me in the recipe challenge fancy honest winner loser and there's a final twist as i take my lambs to the slaughter last thing on my mind right now is [ __ ] shepherd's pie [Music] right welcome back to the f word now time to find out who has won the recipe challenge nervous [ __ ] my [ __ ] look at me i'm shaking but what you've done to me poncy honest winner loser jb come back with the good news yes and you know what if i don't when i'm not sleeping with you just consider that so dish number one number two thank you oh quite strong definitely it's quite it's very light though don't cook very well though yeah though they are brilliant the texture is quite nice instantly says coriander yeah it's really strong that's really nice and there's actually there's a lot of flavor in them bring in the good news yes okay uh the winner and i'm quite happy actually oh yeah [Laughter] oh god come back i hate you listen listen listen what grounds um i want to re-eat i had to say coffee in the kitchen in chinese in the kitchen yeah something like that now get out of here love you so much yes commiseration it's time to say goodbye to my lambs it's the final day for my flock at 17 weeks my lambs are old enough to go to the slaughter i've been a sheep farmer for three and a half months and it couldn't have been any more eventful one of my sheep died at birth and then my lamb charlotte was mysteriously killed at the beckhams [Music] gavin is the only original member of my flock still alive i like gavin the most he's really friendly he's living in my garden along with two french lambs which will play charlotte three weeks ago i called the other two the ugly two because they are ugly but on the day of the slaughter there's a final twist gavin's been diagnosed with pneumonia and been prescribed antibiotics official regulation state alam can't be slaughtered for a month after these kind of injections so at the last minute gavin has escaped slaughter hey buddy we had the most amazing recipe for shepherd's pie and you evaded it come on he's saved luckily for me the two purebred lambs are good for the chop so we load them up for their final journey we can't leave gavin alone in our garden so he's coming too gavin you are one lucky little boy mate i tell you huh hey hey oh dear here we go again you've never actually been inside a avatar no i think it's one of those situations where i don't quite know how i'm going to find it hello mark good morning are you well i'm well good to see you getting off the trailer for you okay great [Music] uh mark it's quite a quick process yes yeah very quick i'm not very good when it comes to these kind of situations um it's done instantly 20 seconds from stun to stick time maximum okay i'm gonna put the electric tongs on yes you if you hold them steady okay they're gonna fall over induce an epileptic fit chained up and then put on the elevator and go upstairs and you can follow it up right and watch me stick and make something in terms of the emotional impact you know they've been in the garden but they're new arrivals so thankfully i'm not attached purposely i didn't get close to them watching being part of it now yeah it's crucial for me right but it's awful when you see them just before it's going to happen yeah i'm going to be holding my lambs as they are stunned with tongs that charge to 200 volts okay let go the shock stuns the lamb so they feel no pain when their throat is cut it's so professionally done it's quick that's the most important yeah i'm just having done within seconds that's great that's just nerves danny last thing on my mind right now is [ __ ] shepherd's pie ready moments later my second lamb is slaughtered the same way a very very odd experience i mean very traumatic i think when you when you just see you know one minute you've got this live van wiggling around next minute that's it i really wanted to learn all i could about what happens after the lambs are killed we start by skinning them it's an incredibly skilled job the initial cuts are called ripping lines because they're ripping through the skin and that was just brute force so you push over both sides i'm really just pulling the sheath out of the wall really yeah it's amazing how hot the animal is yeah hold it there and push and put that hand on there as well and push towards the wall come on push lean on it lean on the rest of the skin is removed by machine to save time unbelievable i mean the lamb is fantastic now does it in terms of quality wise yeah so next stage evisceration takes it up over god you got the lungs the liver there the heart yeah but the liver is amazing that look at the liver it does look very healthy doesn't it as a kidney i'm amazed how hot they are yeah it's hard to believe that you know literally five minutes ago these things were rolling around straight yeah yeah all meat slaughtered in the uk is examined by government inspectors if the carcass passes it gets a stamp of approval one final job i've promised you've earlier would install the brains to cook with i don't want the brain full of [ __ ] skull yeah a little shrapnel on top of the cranial cavity there you go there's the brain exposed that's good and there you have the brain they're beautiful huh no bits of skull guard amazing you're still [ __ ] warm thinking about what process yeah thank you very much awesome it's been a really big eye-opener i can relate to it now because that's how we get it that's how we would arrive at claridges straight from the farm now time to start thinking about burning out the legs breaking it down the rack the neck good a good pair of lambs there okay jb results for the dessert yes the amount of ladies that are happy to pay for desserts [ __ ] me 16 out of 50. what 16. what do they say um two alcoholic two alcoholic yeah the girl what's wrong with that that's the most hilarious thing i've heard all [ __ ] yeah you know that so total that is 75 out of 150 sadly in the end four ex-army officers [Applause] [Music] [Applause]

doesn't actually sit there's a woodland pigeon jonathan you're quite a fussy child when you're a child you were sort of when i was a child you know what i would eat yeah i would eat eggs my brothers called me egg boy and i was in the top bunk as well but you must have something more than sort of eggs well my mum was an okay cook but you know we were i'm not you know pleading public here but we weren't well off family so she'd sometimes do a casual at the weekend but it was just a big old bit of me simmering and she's got a can of baked beans in there anything she had available and that was fine all we used to have i used to like chicken and chips when we had that occasionally you know but it wasn't we didn't have much else we used to have a lot of food that you buy in stores like i remember you remember vesta yeah they used to make the kind of beef risotto that was the most exotic food i've ever had right i want to talk about fanny credit please don't amazing woman and and this year we lost a campaign to help find a new fan you're looking for your own fanny i understand that and i applaud that but why not just do what more commerce used to do a little bit of lippy a long blonde weave double bubble you never know you might win a bathtub you're the one with the man boobs i've actually not really got man boobs what i've got though is i'm carrying a lot of weight down there feel that feel that down there go on [Laughter] so probably not should we have a little look at it jb please have a look at this so this is you back in 1987 yeah as a skinny mini your show was the most successful cookie show ever i think probably yes what do you think was the key to that success that i could cook but i don't believe you had any formal training as a cook did you what do you call formal training for bigger cook there aren't people like that on tv anymore no they really aren't because you're actually saying clearly i'm very good at what you do what kind of advice would you give to any woman out there that's thinking of becoming the next sort of tv cook what you're looking for really some of the personality but but it's a difficult thing because you don't want someone to be false well thousands of them have applied have a quick look at this all right so this is these are amateur fannies yeah the amateur fan is ready all i don't know is that your dough should feel like a fat lady's ass perfect with one hand why is she in a row would you like me to blow do you want to be nigella yeah in here i've got about 100 grams of chickpea flour and there you have one of the most delicious you know i won't show you my my tips on tv but i might show you my tattoos see like that it looks like she wears an egg on her head it's a terrible haircut it's like a hairs on backwards straight in there now i'm tempted to drink it myself but no we'll put it in the dish i think she might be emotionally damaged i could see that they've all they're all obviously quite confident yes they've all got different things to work for them against them they need to be strong charismatic and someone's not going to melt under the pressure you want to get one of those female uh bodybuilders with the long clitorises [Laughter] i'll get your main course sorted the pigeon was lovely actually i really like the asparagus with it as well as the warner one of my friends had the same obviously pigeon it was a bit more cooked and it was a lot nicer right results ladies starters okay jb okay here we go now ladies the number paid of customers before they're starter it's 34 out

like this at work i always look miserable good good pull more wire here we go it looks lovely thank you watch out here's the food snob with the big gob in here is a food packed full of vitamin b12 iron and protein which is produced in britain but unbelievably almost nobody eats it in fact we waste 36 million tons of it a year which is a dreadful shame i'm gonna get you all to eat blood we should eat more of it but us brits find the thought of cooking with blood pretty hard to stomach now that is something i definitely wouldn't be putting past my lips i think it's the thought of it that puts you off straight away yeah if you was going to tell me it was going to be good for you i would i would i would taste it yeah i would eat it does sound a bit sort of like hammer house of horror type of approach to cooking no it feels a little bit too devil worshiping for me i'm not a vampire [Music] it might be out of fashion but protein-rich pig's blood has traditionally been used in cooking i'm going to try some of the world's best blood recipes so i'm here at this abattoir to source some prime fresh ingredient as in all abattoirs the pigs are stunned before being bled my bucket i'm taking my blood to renowned butcher david lishman to learn how to make the classic british blood dish black pudding great it's very rare that we actually get fresh blood nowadays after cooling for a couple of hours the blood oxidizes and turns brown the blood is mixed with barley oatmeal pork fat and lots of herbs and spices and poured into a sausage machine are these bits of intestine then yeah it looks like a kind of a birth control device oh my word lovely this goes into the boiler now right okay for 45 minutes to an hour excellent good nice firm mealy british black pudding yeah it's good right i'll have a bit of that to take home there's a lot more to cooking with blood than black pudding andy holt is an enthusiastic blood chef who's collected recipes from all over the world i'm here to learn how to cook his special italian blood dessert so we're just mixing the egg and the caster sugar together what better way to popularize blood with the british than by appealing to our sweet tooth and into that we're adding melted chocolate just sounds like a chocolate mousse so far yeah and then the next thing we're putting in is the blood now why on earth did the italians dream up making a pudding using blood in a way it's a way to to use up a valuable resource because the blood is actually very good for you obviously it's full of iron it's full of vitamins why andy look at that superb i pasted it you absolutely promised me honestly back memories that squealing pig those exactly like chocolate mousse i'm now convinced that blood is not only good for you delicious beautiful but it's also tasty all i've got to do now is persuade gordon right gordon what i want to do for you right it's italian pancakes called romancini it's like a classic pancake mix and instead of milk you've got blood i've never had a blood pancake you know that are you a kid yeah no water no milk no just blood and this is all pig's blood bloody hell oh it's not something i donated earlier no geez look at that it doesn't look that nice does it actually looks like melted chocolate so just get over it okay cheesy all right let it cook first before you flip it so what did you put inside the pancake or would you actually serve them like that i think for the of testing i am converting you you should have nothing but a blood pancake oh no do you know what that looks like what i imagine your scrotum looks like that's a bit look at that just the smell of it though ah it actually smells like fried blood smells nice it smells nice it's very rubbery ah moaning you can't taste the blood did you swallow there's nothing absolutely nothing wrong it's [ __ ] disgusting janet i don't have a problem with it as i couldn't persuade you to eat the pancake how about shot of blood you're turning [ __ ] hey seriously your feet is golden and that is 100 pigs blood drink it you put lead in your paper saw oh [ __ ] it's fantastic i'm not the man i thought you were janet i know you're a pensioner but now you're a bloodsucking pensioner janet that is not nice [ __ ] [ __ ] vampire no charts oh [Music] i'm heading down the dorset coast to go diving one of my all-time favorite foods spots no speed cameras here is that [ __ ] up i adore scallops and i've stirred them on all my menus but most of them are fished on a commercial scale using dredging which can damage the seabed the sustainable way to catch them is to go diving and pick them up by hand which is what i'm going to do today hand dive scallop especially is something that is considered a bit of a jewel in the crown phenomenal i'm off to meet tom whittle in weymouth who's been diving for scallops since he was 12. have you got any shoes yeah i've got some somewhere did you never wear it right uh temperature-wise what's gonna be like down there 14 degrees if we're lucky yeah yeah if we're lucky yeah serious cheers and are they um in abundance it depends sort of where you go but normally what you do is basically get down there and if there's tons then you just work them yeah and if there's none then you just swim like [ __ ] until you find them that's bad good ready bits yeah i've heard that before we're heading out to the blackhawk wreck where we'll start our dive marine life congregates on wrecks and nearby there's an abundance of scallops how big are they average size probably about that here really about that because in london at the moment getting them from the south coast and the west coast but they're costing about three pound fifty four pounds each each each that's like commercial scholarly [Laughter] the reason that hand dive scallops are so expensive is that they are incredibly hard to catch and a diver will only pick up a fraction of the whole of a commercial fisherman um they're difficult to see aren't they yeah yeah they can be i mean especially uh if they've buried themselves into the sand but it's all about getting your eye into it yeah why is it like this when you get to this stage you're always bursting for a pee it's it's the way that it is it's the rule of the game unbelievable i feel like that [ __ ] condom again now what are these things [Music] [Music] visibility down here today is terrible which makes spotting scallops that are nestled into the sand almost impossible [Music] [Music] here comes the beach file stand back [Applause] elegant isn't it well done good quality scallops ah lovely right beach time tom normally saves his scallops for supper but i want to eat mine straight away the fresher the better right fantastic they look amazing can i open them and clean them yeah so a scalloped tartar yeah basically a raw dye scallop mixed with lime yeah chervil and then a little bit of creme fraiche a mascarpone cheese yeah absolutely amazing dive open the scallop and then eat look i mean they're still pulsating now i'm feeling it's still it's extraordinary mix some creme fresh with mascarpone cheese lime zest lime juice some chervil and salt and pepper right dice the scallops in and all we do now is just fold that in there it's so exciting eating raw scallops so i'm going to serve the scab tata inside the lettuce leaf so just open up the heart of the baby gem lettuce quite a robust leaf this so they can take the scallop absolutely delicious and there we are a very simple scalloped tartar fire away buddy cheers there you go now so tasty ten times better to use hand dived and not dredged and i'd rather pay double for a hand dive yeah than cheap dredge collapse that taste of grit cheers cheers scallops away [Music] first time i had skates and the fish was great so disappointing and just greasy the beetroot was gorgeous it had little bits of cheese in which gave a really unusual flavor okay ladies results of the main course chefs matt how do you think you did i put it all right 29 out of 50. what why uh the one just been big reason too greasy unbelievable you know i personally felt you did a [ __ ] good job you can pull it back yes come on yes next on the menu sarah cox reveals all in the recipe challenge but instead i asked the entire table if we could all have a gang bang i give olympic athletes a run for the money with my fast food jonathan ross files a police complaint you want to suck my what i said hold on i'm being harassed welcome back to the f word now time for another celebrity challenge and it's time for me also to beat sarah cox confident to meet me i'll beat me but beat you beat me all right uh nice to meet you yes i am quite confident yesterday that's your board there okay madam good luck yes yes good luck to you too sir so sarah's making a chili con carne i'm doing exactly the same minced beef fresh oregano um paprika sweet paprika kidney beans slightly pure in the garlic so it's not so intense and then finished with really nice vine tomatoes so it gives that really nice sort of rich dark peppery flavor but not too spicy so for sarah's chili's special chopped onion a bit of chopped garlic might chuck in a bit of red pepper some uh good beef here i don't believe it's hereford but it is british beef good got a bit of tomato puree i might chuck in a bit of wine chopped tomatoes kidney beans i can it's like the bung in method basically i just bung it all in do that and then drink a bit of wine uh and my secret ingredient baked beans uh you've got an amazing food background your father's a a bee farmer in bolton is that right it certainly is he does it mainly for the breeding really you know i think he'll send one in when he's got a big farm bill and so does he have to have a collection of bull semen every other month well he's got a good stock bowl and he's got he imports them from canada and that's really got longer legs or something so you grew up eating lots of meat yes well yeah pigs cows did you ever get attached to them yeah i really did i really really the piglets charlotte's web was all the rage wasn't it now i know it sounds like i need therapy from this story but i did actually used to go to the to the abattoir with my dad when he loaded all the pigs in oh really and i used to cry myself to sleep and then wake up when it was all over you know i never went into the albertoire i don't know now but the nice thing about it you understood exactly from an early age where meat comes from yeah exactly so i've got diamonds in the back garden the main objective is to get the kids up to speed exactly where it comes from and b i'm in that sort of debatable mood whether or not to take them to the abattoir and show them the final thing uh i wouldn't be expensive though years of therapy that you have to pay for either that will turn out to be [ __ ] vegetarians aren't they oh i can hear some noise in your pant i'm happy huh it's sizzling it's alive it's in there so you've got onions garlic beef in there what else is in there there's my fresh chili in there i'm gonna blend this beef off and then i'm gonna whack in a glass of red wine and let that bubble away i'm using uh liam perrin what's your secret ingredient i've got a tin of baked beans you're using what can i bake beans i tend to bake beans yeah no so red wine with baked beans i can't wait to taste it together the one thing i've always admired about you you know that if you're a bit like me you speak your mind yeah what's the most embarrassing thing you've ever said in your entire life oh no there's my mum had taken out all the stuff from her pub on the christmas meal i meant for us to all go out and dance but instead i asked the entire table if we could all have a gang bang and everyone just went completely silent and my mum just went ashen and i didn't know what i meant and i still to this day i kind of meant there's a word out there that isn't that but at the ripe old age of 32 now you're fully aware of what gangbang is now don't you yeah yeah i mean not from personal experience obviously but no i learned quickly after actually what it was and i was like all right i'm now gonna have my tomatoes these big beef tomatoes are perfect they're very juicy and they're full of flavor so with tomatoes is it fine to keep the skin on because i always want to put fresh tomato in and i think oh do i have to don't come in boiling water and get the skin off because something like a chili something easy and straightforward like that keeping the skin on it's absolutely fine you know that that's cool you've got a great figure you're very slim do you watch carefully what you eat or do you just sort of work out the same time i love food yep i can be quite happily eating breakfast and i'll be planning what i want for lunch and what i want for dinner you eat well yeah i didn't i used to model and i didn't eat well at all yeah it was like seven and a half stone it was ridiculous like my knees were fatter than my thighs it was like 19. i lived on like you know malbolites and coffee how long were we modeling for a couple of years i mean without success successful i still managed to fit in some shifts behind my mum's bar at the pub you traveled across the world uh modeled in yeah in seoul in south korea on two trips did they ever try to make you eat a dog out there in terms of that i did eat a dog i didn't know i'd eaten dog until i got to the joint of the bone and then i realized it wasn't chicken because it was kind of a different yeah structure what are the taste of this is just deep fried meat like kind of like chicken really so they both simmer down for 20 minutes okay then the blind tasters will taste them and you'll lose fast food doesn't have to mean baked beans [Music] i've run eight marathons 26 long hard miles each and if there's one thing i've learned is that eating right is just as important as the training so you'd think that two super fast athletes training for the olympics would be eating a varied diet in between training but they're not and their excuses they say they've got no time we train in the morning three or four hours you know maybe have half an hour for lunch um and then back in training in the afternoon so it's not six days a week so it's busy schedule lunchtime's a struggle because it's on the rush it's on the go and uh it's just food for fuel there's nothing interesting about it at all all i e is just a ready-made pasta pot it's literally just pasta mixed with a bit of chicken bit sauce just because we're training for the olympics we don't need anything special in particular we just need to eat good amounts of the right stuff i want to learn how to cook something nice quick tasty and i want to be able to impress my girlfriend that i can actually cook so i've come to meet best mates chris and andy to help them be as fast in the kitchen as they are on the track lightning that looked bloody fast yeah um how many times a day do you train twice a day twice a day today five days a week six days a week six days a week i mean that's extraordinary for one goal an olympic gold that's the old it's the olympics yeah who's the fastest well he won't deny it it's me his personal best is better but the last time we raced a live tv you're going to hit him i took him out he took him out i took you out we'll do me a favor take me out i want to see just how fast you are yeah you sure 15 stone 40 years of age yeah so go easy on the old man yes good luck let's go [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] oh [ __ ] i felt like [ __ ] shrek going over there yeah i'll try the sprinting you know that screen's better so it's all in the posture question yeah yeah sprinting's better don't [ __ ] you know i'm [ __ ] now you just confirmed you're fast on the track i'm gonna show you how to be fast in the kitchen ready when you caught your breath right time-wise lunch you've got what half an hour half an hour max yeah run me through a normal lunch what did you have yesterday pasta pot and that's it that's it a pasta pop that's a faster part i mean it looks boring it is boiling yes you must be bored with it by now no god i am fed up with it pasta doesn't have to be boring you know that so i'm gonna come up with three very exciting pasta dishes we're gonna be fast furious and delicious first recipe spaghetti white tomato sauce basil chili and finished with prawns [Music] pasta is the ultimate fast food and something i eat when i'm training for the marathon how did you find that good how'd you find america yeah it was tough yeah very tough so in the time it takes to cook that spaghetti the sauce is ready yeah it is chili now handy a little tip just give it a roll like that right this releases the seeds so you can discard them easily [Music] i mean you guys eat well don't you yeah yeah you don't have to follow a strict diet do you no everything in moderation is what you know that's what it's see that's the about kind of food that we need right recipe took eating fast here chili pasta pancetta leeks and mushrooms and if you can't get hold of pancetta bacon is absolutely fine chop the leeks finely and add to the bacon i mean the ultimate goal is um a gold medal in beijing yeah yeah four letters that would be better i'll win one in beijing and defend it in london i mean the chinese in your hometown your own country hosting the olympics after three minutes add some creme fraiche which lightens the dish that's fast isn't it add some grated parmesan and finish with chopped parsley that's the kind of time scale that we're working on so that's perfect [Music] recipe three this one's good panic chicken goat cheese pine nuts and runner beans good runner beans in garlic pine nuts in okay rosemary on there please chris take the ingredients out the pan and prepare the chicken chicken breast i'm going to butterfly it okay just keep the knife nice and flat and just open it up cutting the chicken this way leaves the breast thinner and therefore it cooks quicker that looks that beautiful that's a really nice dry goat cheese and at work we keep them in the freezer and perfect for finishing pasta it's a great tip because they never go off this is not boring is it oh no we can't rely on time as an excuse to not look after ourselves no no all three you're happy with of course this one i like particularly we've got the world championship coming up the end of the summer yeah i just hope the [ __ ] your times are faster at the world championships golden how are you very well thank you how are you well it was fine one time when it all arrived it was nice do you want our honest opinion of course i want your honest opinion the cheese flavor overpowered the fish if you must use the parmesan next time great don't want cubes or parmesan on there simple produce yep simply prepared are you gonna pay for it yes that's the most important not everyone on the table is but i would oh my god what are you not paying for them all you're telling me how it should be done yes that's how it should be done [ __ ] it come with me yeah two seconds

dessert yeah this is like something from the like the new romantic period ladies you're gonna have to help him right all right does this turn you on huh is one of my favorites can you stop eating the [ __ ] peaches please yeah [Music] panpodeu with carmelized peaches basically posh eggy bread and the secret behind this of course is using old bread if you use old bread it doesn't absorb all the nice egg mixture and it gets nice and crisp on the outside peaches hot pan sugar the secret now is to get a little bit of color on the peaches but not getting the caramel too dark roast once we've got the colour on the peaches then we're going to start adding the butter basil now the basil just perfumes the caramel just gives it really nice light sweet summery flavor out the sauce for the pan perdue a really nice fresh vibrant raspberry coulis sugar lemon straight onto the mixer blitz [Music] and then get the bottom of your ladle and just run that around sieve lovely eggy bread is very very simple eggs vanilla smell absolutely delicious icing sugar milk cream whisk so we've got this really nice sweetened fresh vanilla custard mint that's ready for the brioche i'm gonna cut lengthways nice big long slices hot pan bread in and then back out not too long into the pan up and over and it's literally done in seconds [Applause] get my cooling down one side mint icing sugar pan purdue with caramelized peaches and raspber cooling done that is the perfect summer on a plate let's do one at a time and we'll do it together yes one slice is not being on the generation game i'm a dive yes that's okay in nicely peaches in that's it you caramelize them in good good water all right ladies go [ __ ] okay good that's nice mine's ready chef yeah right good on to the board please

flour then add coconut for texture and a pinch of salt sounds strange in the dessert but it works brilliantly especially with the fritters makes the batter nice and crisp start crushing and use the back of the fork and just push it against the side of the bowl and then once you've mixed that through i'm gonna make that mix now slightly fragrant with some lime zest now the lime just really elevates the sort of richness and the denseness of the banana a couple of tim film so it doesn't get a skin on top sit that in the fridge for 15 minutes batter now is ready use a metal spoon to drop the batter to the bottom of the pan i mean they hit that oil they puff up that's why it's important to put your spoon into the oil so the mixture runs off and creates this lovely little fritter and then gently fry get a slotted spoon and nice and carefully turn them over the smell of that lime is extraordinary fry for two to three minutes as they start floating it signifies the fact that they're cooked off with a gas and just let them drain are those beauties lovely sprinkling when they're hot with the sugar actually sticks to them they're done ready to go gazpacho for dessert sweet and refreshing pineapple like you've never tasted before first job the gazpacho soup for me the secret of a great gazpacho is overripe tomatoes peppers cucumber a little bit of heat with a garlic we've got to leave it to marinade first peppers cut around the flat edges to minimize waste [Music] then chop the nice thing about making the gazpacho there's no set recipe because you can put it together purely all tomatoes half peppers half tomatoes i like the flavor of the cucumber in there as well that gives it that freshness the secret of a great gazpacho is the longer you leave it marinating the better the flavour so if you can get this done the night before and left in the fridge the results are stunning the green and red peppers have subtly complementary flavors and go well with ripe tomatoes start off by removing the bitter core get a little knife and just put it in where the core is and twist it around and you get this little core out i remember my first experience eating a gazpacho in spain mind-blowing i've never forgotten that quarter your tomatoes keeping the juicy seeds that add so much depth of taste nice then from there cucumber just peel that the seeds i'm gonna leave in that gives it the flavor and the texture cucumber and gazpacho does exactly what it does in a pims it sort of freshens it up and makes it mouth-watering slice that in half again into quarters and chop now to give gazpacho its unique texture and thicken the soup bread and the crispy the crust the better then garlic thinly sliced next spring onions nice and roughly chopped and basil stalks and all we can use stalks and basil stalks parsley stalks tarragon stalks they have the most amazing flavor basil in and now we're gonna start marinating salt black pepper and a good coating of olive oil this gives it a glossy creamy flavor and the cherry vinegar that's the perfect vinegar for the gazpacho it's a strong acidic complement to the flavors then just mix it up and the smell already is incredible it doesn't look like a gazpacho but by the time this marinades and all those flavors start getting to know one another all of a sudden you've got this huge explosion of contrast now push that down in the restaurants we press the marinade down overnight a couple of big pans on top and we crush all the ingredients and then blitz it the next day flavor is extraordinary leave all those fresh ingredients packed with goodness to marinade from half an hour to even overnight and then when you blend it it just comes together like this sumptuous rich delicious chilled soup to go with my super tasty soup i've got an ultra healthy and exciting dessert carpaccio of pineapple which is a chefy way of saying super thinly sliced it's done with a twist we're gonna have a delicious flavoured salt has to be flavored with vanilla simply scrape out the vinegar seeds and add to sea salt along with the pod to store now that basically keeps forever there's no sale by date because it's salt and vanilla so so fragrant so delicious you don't need much of this fragrant salt to intensify the sweetness of the pineapple pineapple sliced peeled pineapple into wafer thin pieces it's almost like nice little discs slightly transparent [Music] once you've sliced the pineapple take the flavor to another level a light sprinkle of vanilla salt and arrange the pineapple in a flower shape [Music] it's a beautiful way of finishing a meal the fragrance other than the crunch with the salt and the vanilla salt just marinades the pineapple beautifully then scatter nutrient rich pomegranate seeds over the top to finish finely shredded fresh mint just slice them really thin and then give that nice cool minty flavour pineapple my carpaccio is ready and my gazpacho has been marinating in the fridge time to blend the soup in onto your blender and start off nice and slowly blend until super fine and gloriously silky and serve refreshingly cold get your bowl and pour it in now to finish it get some fresh basil roll it nice and tight and shred it and then drop it into your bowl fresh chopped basil and then finally just a touch of extra virgin olive oil just to give that really nice additional freshness and look at that healthy and delicious gazpacho soup to me is a taste of mediterranean sunshine in a bowl followed by the wafer thin carpaccio of pineapple with jewels of pomegranate goodness for dessert practically all of your five a day in one incredible healthy lunch you

#GordonRamsay #Cooking...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, you think of the flavor and the texture of avocado rich phenomenal i want to make it a little bit more vibrant black sesame seeds a nice pinch of chili flakes i quite like it hot a touch of salt and a touch of pepper so that nice dry combination of the lemon zest black sesame seeds and the heat the chili this is light healthy quick but so tasty sourdough bread three nice chunky thick slices open them up lightly season them little touch of olive oil brings the whole crust to life rub all that seasoning in but you can use too bad you can use a baguette but the richness from the sourdough with the silky creaminess of avocado is mind-blowing and then get the grill up to temperature and push these down go the extra mile we've all put bread in a toaster of a difference of grilling the bread this way is extraordinary that nice smoky charcoal flavor off with the gas beautiful now the avocado you've got to treat them with love respect press on the end here and if your thumb softens you can tell that avocado's ripe never press here you just end up bruising it slice down until you feel that stone in the middle and then just roll around and then it's just a little gentle twist off stone and out cut them into quarters the back of your knife peel back that skin if the avocado is nice and ripe it should just all fall away slice just take your quarters fan them out and push them into the bread the ripe of the avocado the better the flavor but look for ones free from soft spots and blemishes which can suggest bruising get your lemon squeeze that will stop the avocado from discoloring and then get your crunch ready to go on top sprinkle a very generous light way got the fragrance from the lemon zest the crunch from the sesame seed the heat that little chili flake which just wakes up that avocado they look expensive that for me is a delicious light start to the day avocado on sourdough toast with lemon and black sesame sprinkle every time i put a healthy recipe together a healthy dish it needs a bit of a treat so this is a lovely stunning get up and go fresh granola first thing in the morning the treat here is in that little baby honey so that sweetens it so just start off with 200ml of delicious honey into a pan just to warm up in she goes now i know these are a chef's favorite but it makes all the difference especially for breakfast a fresh vanilla pod and i think of the way that i use herbs to add flavor to soups and salads i'd like to think vanilla does exactly the same scrape out all those wonderful seeds in now the staple of the granola is the oats [Music] next puff rice delicious crunchy but light and fluffy next add wheat bran and your seeds pumpkin sunflower and linseed and then almonds incredible that nice heavy weight from the nut bunch now bring the honey to the boil slowly drizzle that amazing honey in give that a really good mix coat the granola with the hot honey just slowly churn it using the outside of the bowl you can see it just getting nice and sticky once the granola is completely coated in honey it's ready to bake now spread the mix on baking paper i'm gonna season it lightly with a touch of salt on top the salt throughout dries up the oats and the honey will roast color and glaze the granola nice into the oven for 25 to 30 minutes [Music] 10 minutes into the cooking simply run a spoon across the top to turn the mix and ensure it's crunchy all over smell that light roast look at the color honestly look it's crispy it's delicious now i'm gonna tart it up and put some lovely dried cranberries that just gives us chewy sweet flavor delicious and then finally these beautiful berries goji berries goji berries are high in antioxidants and have been eaten china for centuries for their healing properties but you can add any dried fruit you like the cranberry and the goji berries gives it that nice chewy rich texture to the granola now this is the best way to store it it looks incredible really incredible look at that that eat well stay well right milk my homemade crunchy granola it looks good tastes good and it's packed with healthy grains superfood berries and seeds it's incredibly good for you too a breakfast for champions start off with a chili now give it a little rub so you can hear those seeds being released get your knife and come all the way down turn it over and just slice it into four and then finely chop that chili i want this salad slightly hot so i'm gonna use all the chili but a half the seeds the seeds are where the heat is so the less you use the milder your dish nicely chopped next one of my favorite pastes tamarind paste this is quite tart quite sour but it's a wonderful compliment to the sweetness of the fruit and it goes brilliantly well with the chilli palm sugar and this is where it sweetens up the dressing because it enriches it then the zest and the juice of the lime cut it into quarters and then twist the lime to maximize and all that juice out now to finish that dressing off some toasted peanuts get the pan nice and hot a little touch of salt that'll help dry roast the peanuts even quicker make sure you get a really nice dark color on those peanuts because it will really transform that dressing to crush your roasted nuts the mess free way simply wrap them in a clean cloth and use a rolling pin or a pan to bash them crush that's the hard bit done now for the fruit and here's an easy way to prep a pineapple pineapple take off the top take off the bottom and stand it up use the corner of your knife and follow down basically like shaving the pineapple don't worry about these little spikes there the secret behind doing it this way is not losing half the pineapple there's nothing wrong with a few brown bits it's all good fiber slice the pineapple in half and then slice down each quarter slice across and chop delicious pineapple chunks next apples and pears diced then to give a lovely fresh light note the seeded cucumber i don't want the seeds in the fruit salad the cucumber seeds will make it very watery and dilute the strength of that wonderful chili in there cucumber in with some sweetness delicious mango just slice it nicely get your dressing and just drizzle that over the fruit salad in secret of a good fruit salad is not drowning in the dressing but really make sure that you've got that nice coating on all the fruits don't worry about just having for breakfast because this is the kind of tangy fruit salad you can have for lunch a healthy snack in the afternoon but it transforms a traditional fruit salad into something really delicious spicy fruit salad with a kick of chili trust me it's an incredible breakfast and a guaranteed pick me up in the morning

estate agent [Music] being a chef being a build up you have to work for your money whereas i can pick up a couple of phone calls and i've made my 6 000 pounds there's opportunities to make a lot of money i might made by money and success the way i see it everyone needs bricks and mortar everyone's out there to make money just the red wine don't need the red wine as a team we're very good at cooking they've got to be golden brown on both sides you know with your baby sweeter and your peppers your chickens and things like that it's a challenge i like using my hands i like to be busy i think you're fine i'm the hardest worker now you know stop blowing your own trumpet sir if anyone's going to wind up gordon the most scotty steph steph he doesn't mean to hurt his will i can't take

no i couldn't eat it would you pay for it yeah i'd pay for that in in here yeah not in a calf no it's way too much you wouldn't get food like that in a cafe well you could get baked you got you know a black pudding an egg what you get it's not good like that you really get sausages with it did you understand the menu because i devised a little easy format menu something to make you feel less intimidated pictures of the size little explanation how did you know as much as you choked i didn't know that veal was a baby cow oh no i'll get away with that and in general you're actually quite a fussy eater aren't you i'm not fussy you're demanding [ __ ] no no no cheese no fruit no it's no no cheese yeah no onions no tomatoes no mushrooms right now sadly [ __ ] you now they're emotional fussy [ __ ] what ah yeah all right you you you you know you eat well what's that what they might taste no no i i i don't eat a lot i really don't but and what i do eat is is not that great for me shocker obviously that was the main course i enjoyed the starting you haven't paid for it yes absolutely very happy i don't know about the rest of these they're very excited personally i think that egg was well overcooked the starter was okay but it was something that i'd get at home my mum would probably cook a bit better okay results for the starters let's go what'd you reckon 25 the number of customers are prepared to pay for the starter [ __ ] out 14 yeah only 14 now 50. 36 customers refuse to pay yeah why too long obviously and the egg all rule are overcooked obverance unbelievable yeah so far that is the worst score ever seriously yeah [ __ ] what can we do though man let's just see what we can do around there that's it steph you can come back yes you know don't worry you can come back from that sorry crap let's make up for it and get 50 for maine yes next on the menu my son jack goes from boy to action man when you think you're in line reach forward and pull the trigger yeah good shot first time around it's time for the main course a delicious feeler scallop with caponata and the heat is on for chris moyles yes wow what's the matter with you welcome back to the f-word now it's never too early to teach your son about birds [Music] i'm taking jack off in his first ever foodie adventure in search of something that we've really stopped eating a rook rook pie is an old english classic but today it's almost entirely forgotten a shame because thousands of rooks are shot every spring they've become a real pest damaging crops and stealing other birds eggs you're not scared about going in the woodlands you look like an action man like that we'll be shooting with gamekeeper dave whitby an old mate of mine who's got a problem with rooks on his land welcome good to see you mate good to see you first time ever shooting a gun yes excited yeah do you want to go back and call mommy no let's go buddy pound how about you miss yes that's enough when you think you're in line reach forward and pull the trigger yeah good shot first time around good shot you got the target are you ready for another one more take care plane when you're ready wait what was the peck no no that's two pounds aren't you oh no jack's a chip off the old block but today it'll be me shooting the rooks we're heading into the woods where the birds nest the traditional way to call rooks is to shoot the young as they leave their nests okay buddy load me up please i'll give me five don't miss dad don't miss that don't scare them bloody hell jack there's one through there look oh just up through there safety catch off yeah you got a leaf instead damn right see if you can spot me jack i think i'm just seeing one black there okay good man good man excellent good shot thanks buddy see if we can spot another one see that good job there's not much meat on a rook so we'll need at least six to feed the three of us uh how exciting is this buddy there right good one just landed through here mate good shot good excellent now can we go and get them yeah i need one go get it on quickly jack may not be old enough to hunt for real but he makes a damn good gun dog well done jack yeah it's got blood on its feet yeah of course it's gonna have blood on there let's go stop acting like a girl you know warm witches come here huh amazing huh quite clean shots good man [Music] i've never eaten rook before so i have no idea what it tastes like but with a little tlc we can bring this forgotten food back to now we need to pull people's plates back for me and rip off the breasts please quick as that isn't it well listen mate you're doing a great job there you know that huh that's his liver yeah we could eat that as well yep and there's his heart there look turn it upside down that's it on his breast like now from there look watch turn it around and then we're just going to take the breasts off there okay there we go see yeah not that smaller breast is it huh we're going to do something very very simple just a really nice rook salad almost like a pigeon salad with green beans spring onions beetroot and a hazelnut vinaigrette so we're going to sort of lightly marinade the rook first some salt and pepper on there please nicely and rub the garlic over there please jack now a little bit of hazelnut oil and a little bit of sherry vinegar now get your fingers in there it smells really nice nice yeah good while the rook marinades it's time for the salad green beans beetroot spring onion and oak leaf lettuce good lovely drain the beans and add some salt hazelnut oil and coriander smells yeah absolutely dude ready for the rock yes yep okay so touch of olive oil in very very quickly wow literally seconds put the rest of the marinade in there as well okay you don't want any rock because you don't like rock do you i do no you don't let's go buddy they're a lot more tender i thought they would be no this for me is as good as if not better than pigeon it just looks like a bit of venison yeah i think it's about time that something like this bird rook should find his way back on traditional british menus yeah absolutely i i'm truly surprised how good that was you happy with yours yeah yeah that was delicious now it's time for the brigade to take on the main course god help me [Music] it's got a paville caponata it's delicious it's very lean it's good for you and it's a great alternative to beef now caponata basically it's like a ratatouille but without all the tomato puree so you can identify exactly what's in it chop peppers celery onions aubergines now it's really important to have something like low gene inside a caponata it gives it that sort of bittersweet flavor hot pan olive oil season [Applause] [Music] red wine vinegar and that sort of wakes everything up tomato basil olives capers lovely smells amazing out onto a plate and that stops it from overcooking and turning mush wow go up a veil now we're going to panic it basically that means flour egg wash and bread crop three very simple stages a couple of tablespoons of flour eggs breadcrumbs parmesan but these will take it to a different dimension [Music] a nice heavy coating of breadcrumbs and palms and cheese prevents the veal from drying out and now she's ready for the pan olive oil just just starts to smoke in she goes i love that sound if it goes into a cold pan with olive oil you've got the scallop greasy we only turn it once it can rip or tear quite easily check the colour wow now this is where it gets really exciting pine nuts capers butter and that helps to toast the pine nuts fry off the capers and really give the most amazing flavour lovely basil just the heat out of the butter will start to cook the basil capanata be generous with it wow and then with the veal up and on summer's here vela scallop with caffenata done right pasta it's a very fine spaghetti it's already cooked so just reheating it yes in literally 30 seconds onto the hot plate let's go okay parsley running through there top of the plate fresh pasta on the vehicle goes on if you make 50 portions like that we've got to do it man you will have the biggest comeback ever okay right wait wait wait wait wait and then just go come on boys let's go chris yes yeah four veal away let's go hey chris we're not [ __ ] this up all right come on come on come on you have to seize it first yeah season of it so chef do you have to season the ville that's right yeah don't put a bunch until we wait for the first side cooks wait wait just wait just relax can we [ __ ] watch the pants please they're all on fire now yes guys oh they're [ __ ] i mean this is a joke there's an insult to catering please where there's nothing where'd you put it i haven't touched it i'm just dealing with the wheel where's my place we clean the place then guys at least show that you care a little [ __ ] bit yeah sell this please i told you number eight yes let's go down go steph yeah clear down guys the veal is quite soggy so it's not got that kind of nice light crispiness around it it's quite wet and a bit sort of stodgy on the plate i like the capers and the olives with the veal it was really nice yeah i definitely have it again i'm not particularly enjoying it it's the the feel is woefully soggy it's like a piece of like wet brillo pad results yes main course let's go quickly right step how do you think you did i don't think we did that badly 25 and that's not bad for you well after the 14 i don't think 25 or 30 is bad let's see okay out of 50. how many customers paid for the main course 21 what decided to pay [ __ ] me that's not bad that's [ __ ] right here we go again enjoy the main course yeah lovely yes yeah i'm surprised you [ __ ] got it they are an absolute nightmare in there state asians all

put their junk food ways behind them um i'm going to show you my tool now yeah it's time for dessert an italian classic tiramisu and comedienne miracule is hot stuff in the recipe challenge well it's quite instantaneous actually sexy grandma welcome back to the f word here's the first builders doing things quickly we all think that builders are lazy are slackers who are always on a tea break so when i heard there were three builders from essex that were constantly whinging the fact that they never had chance to eat properly or cook for themselves i had to meet them these boys rip out and replace kitchens across essex and they reckon this leaves them no time to cook or eat properly [Music] i'm fed up eating the same thing every day it's just pork pies chocolate bars crisps you just really don't get the time to go out there and get something to eat on a proper basis it's always the case nearest location where you're working that's where you're going to go and eat we'd love golden to help us create something ideally within half an hour to keep us on fire throughout the day everyone's got time to cook if they've got the right recipes and i mean everyone essex builders now they're probably having a [ __ ] bacon sandwich all set on their ass gentlemen good morning how are we tired tony good to see you boy you're welcome i'm harry harry nice to see you oh my gary gary how are you everybody good bye mate yeah so why have you got a reputation being such lazy [ __ ] uh not us definitely on this side no way we're dealing with people's homes this is not some you know building site where uh if you are sitting on your ass in the port cabin or something you can get away with it right how long would it really seriously take to to rip the kitchen out without any tea breaks or bacon butter yeah about an hour maximum i'd like to see how difficult it is ripping out a kitchen i'd like to become a proper builder yeah i like to become a proper chef maybe not with [ __ ] bling bling like that [Music] can you get my hammer four out of that box first place mate hammer four yeah [ __ ] man what is the hammer for the banging [Music] what tattoo have you got there what is it the tattoo pg tips you work your ass off yet you're [ __ ] abusing yourselves i'm going to show you my tool now my tool is a powerful gas stove in the builder's tent there's still half an hour demolishing left to do so i'm going to show the rubble brothers that they can cook a delicious lunch in less than 25 minutes yeah we haven't got much time yeah we're gonna do a very quick easy beast chew [Music] onions garlic thyme hey look at the style of this see that the secret behind this dish is one part so it's like a one pot wonder yeah yeah okay simple philosophy no color no flavor the reason why i've cut them into small chunks like that is to cook it faster these guys have better get a move on i am not going to be beaten by a builder with a bum crap big enough to park a bike in [Music] no smell tablespoon of tomato puree so creme fraiche it just lines up a little bit that is that is my special type amazing how quick it comes together gary this is where all the hard work's been going on derek you've been working hard my money together you'd never get this squally food from a takeaway no all right i can't believe you cooked this mate yeah i'm going back to my own kitchen now but first here this is for you guys yeah i want it in the back of the van i want you to use it turn it on get it hot put your pan on and cook yes definitely i've always wanted a drum [Laughter] machine pancake timber soup stick to your pears work together let's go start whisking ice and sugar in pour in start with it into an hour yes yes let's go yes enough vanilla masala yep yeah good right cream in let's go you continue with skin cream in let's go steph taste it yes little crisp put in the background to set please yeah let's go time for dessert an italian classic [Music] tiramisu basically pick me up that's what it means in italian but it's easy simple delicious and very very fast we split it into two bowls mascarpone put that into the bowl and just let it go nice and soft in the next bowl 150ml of cream icing sugar whisk now it's really important that we don't over whip this cream we're just looking like a nice sort of thick lava consistency no more than that already within seconds it's got nice and sort of light and soft vanilla extract now we use an extract over fresh mirror because it gives a really nice sort of dense dark color masala wine it's got a really nice sort of cafe lay color now on the cream coffee now it's really important that coffee is ice cold just add in thirds don't add it all shred away [Applause] fold in our cream and icing sugar [Music] lovely so it's a really nice light turmeric that is fast and sets within 20 minutes in the fridge bowl coffee ladies fingers and just into the coffee turn them round and out again so what happens now they're soggy on the outside still nice and crispy in the center take your martini glass fingers in pretty generous with it fridge 20 minutes chocolate great and look nice little shards

four away [Music] be careful not too long see they're coming out really soggy you want to come back to really hard to put it in the most important thing about this challenge is get it out fast now yes why they're coming out so please there's four they should be flying out there's actually nothing cooked guys you're just putting it together now just put it in a glass that's actually that's the one with glasses customer glasses go please double 14. let's go [Applause] [Laughter] dessert was absolutely gorgeous really light and fluffy and i love the the moist biscuit it was it was really really stunning i really really loved it what i've got so many mouths now goodness gracious me miracial is going to try and beat me in the recipe challenge ready as i'll ever be now you're cooking something authentic yeah yes i'm cooking my um my turkey dal takada yeah which is a kind of staple punjabi dish yeah very much thank you very simple so the idea is that you stake the dish and i have to come up with my own version of it so i'm going to do a vegetable korma and someone will use lentils um squash aubergine carrot and you're gonna have what in yours basically tomatoes lentils and spices it's very basic fantastic i cannot believe i'm cooking vegetarians you know what i'm saying to meat man isn't it my god now why did you choose this particular dish i cook it a lot it's it's a real favorite with the family and of course lentils are really really good for you does it make you fart uh yeah really badly well not me i'm a lazy i don't do that yeah why is that ladies don't fart we don't fart it's never never we blow our noses very loudly and we will spell the air that way my wife farts no don't say that and and then she blames the children which is so unfair yeah children are very useful for that and dogs fantastic i'm so glad we're talking about bottom things i'll be cooking this is lovely i know i know now my god your ring's enormous mr nancy mira goodness gracious me my ring's enormous thank you for that my darling right i'm not used to talking on such a big thing what are you doing there i'm basically frying up the ginger garlic cumin seeds and mustard seeds which are going to form the basis of the dal you have to really make sure that cumin seeds are cooked they need at least two minutes because if you undercook them they make quite a bitter taste in the dal so you're going to be quite careful with them now in here garlic ginger shallots i'm just going to make a very quick sort of paste and blend them that helps to thicken the corner and give it some sweetness what those spices you put in there my daddy um i'm putting in garam masala nice ground coriander lovely now i'm using garam masala as well it's the all-purpose spice oh yes what lentils are you using there i'm using a mixture of red lentils and split mung i find that mung on its own is very watery yeah and if you mix them the red lentils are a bit firmer so you get a nicer consistency so onions mustard seeds star and nice and cinnamon stick now that's just to infuse the oil just to get everything going in a way that we're sort of getting it nice and spicy and making the foundation and i'm going to pop in a whole green chili oh whole a rather large bunch that is a very large one yeah yes have you ever been in an indian kitchen and actually you know cooked i live in a blue linden kitchen what do i need to go to one in a restaurant no no but in terms that's what i do get paid for if you do in a restaurant but i've spent a childhood my whole childhood watching my mum and my aunties cook really oh yeah from when i was really little is that how the inspiration for the q mars is that how it sort of arrived yeah from the family point of view absolutely because that is hysterical i grew up surrounded by very strong funny women you know completely away from the cliche of what people think indian women are about and food was a huge part of my childhood food is a huge part of indian culture it's how we connect and it's i think for my parents as well it's how they keep home alive when we were little it was like soul food indian food was like the living connection to that home you know that's what food should be about food's about love isn't it family who did love in fact i couldn't love anyone that didn't love food yep really no i don't like hot food no i know that seems blasphemous for an indian but actually i think a lot of what people mistake for curry yeah it's just a whole lot of chili and not much else and i think good indian cooking has layers of flavour in it is that because you get ring steamed yeah i do actually see it's it's quite common in chefs you know that chefs love curry normally friday night yeah normally friday but you see that's the cliche it's like yeah we'll you know we'll come out of the pub we'll have a ruby murray we'll eat something really hot that'll impress our mates and we'll throw it up on the pavement outside afterwards and that's quite an insult to what is a fabulous i know i know it is insane which i have to say was one of the funniest sketches i've ever seen what are you doing can i come and see yeah of course you can so vegetables are in butternut squash courgettes and aubergine yeah yeah then i put my almond paste in with a ginger shallots and garlic almond paste that's together i'm going to add my lentils now which ones are those then these are the pre lentils very nice yeah after that coming up the wind factor right i know this dish yeah warn you why so yeah no are you working on new series like kumar's no well we've done seven yep and i suppose there is something about going out on a high yeah you don't want to hang around people think i'm good not them again so what's great there yeah it was fun that sort of voice you put on how long does it take you to sort of you know get up to speed with that well it's quite instantaneous actually sexy grandma so what you'll do to yours next oh is that it oh i don't know how many asian mothers does it take to change a light bulb i don't know don't worry about me i'll sit in the dark hey no all right that's lovely uh that looks all right and you see it doubles as a face mask because you can just put your face and steve steam your paws and steam away yeah so just finish mine with a little touch more of coconut milk a couple of tablespoons freshly chopped coriander and then squeeze a fresh lemon in there tell them what you do now you're putting your garlic in there yeah it's very simple it's just garlic tomatoes yeah and what'd you call that though a tadka i think it means like a sauce or a topping maybe right they both simmer now for 20 minutes then our blind tasters get their hands on it and then i'm gonna win simple as that next on the menu i take my sheep to palatial pastures we're going to beckingham palace look at the size of it they find it very delicious and i'll find out who wins the recipe challenge but the winner for this time yes is for the past five weeks i've been looking for the next great female tv cook to fill the aprons of delia nigella and fanny craddock i've had thousands of applications so far hi i'm ellie welcome to my kitchen so let's see if we can bring back the fanny but what i want to do today is to make sure that we use everything that we've got in the lava so see you in a bit i've got some stirring to do now this will be perfect for some people other people prefer a richer chocolate flavor there we go while that's cooking i'm going to get on with the mayonnaise start off by making chocolate magic melting moments and i'm hoping that you'll give me a chance on your program an asian funny what do you reckon those are some of my favorites welcome back to the f word now time for the

If you...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.927159, my first recipe is so quick and easy but seriously impressive and deceptively cheap homemade gnocchi making your enoki is so simple to do yet the results are absolutely stunning and it's a great way of using up leftover baked potatoes you can make noki just with flour and eggs however the potato gives it a nice light sort of creamy fluffy texture cut them in half take your spoon and scoop the inside of those potatoes i'm using leftover baked potatoes but this really works as well with leftover ball potatoes two choices you can get a fork and sort of mash the potato and get it nice and light and fluffy or this little gadget it's called a ricer i suppose it's a posh word for a potato masher just squeeze gently you can see how nice and light it is almost like fluffy little strands of potato you can do this when the potatoes are hot it'll go through the rice just so much quicker just slice that off there now a nice spoon of okata a little touch of salt and pepper it's really important to season the mixture as we go along otherwise the nokia becomes really bland flour over the ricotta sieve so there's no lumps one delicious egg give that a little whisk now make a little well in the center you want a nice soft pliable ball of dough give that a really good mix get some time flowers in there and this time is light fragrant and it's just a really nice herb and with the ricotta it tastes brilliant just pick the little tips the time flowers next flour your hands generously and knead the mixture into a dough fold in and push and basically what it's doing is get it nice and smooth as it starts to get a little bit wet and just add a little touch of flour we want something really nice and soft now don't overwork it it stops the nokia from expanding when it hits the pan that's exactly what i want a nice sort of soft fragrant ball cut the ball in half lightly flour the hands and just roll it gently just think of a big long cigar the mixture will start getting a little bit sort of wetter but do not add lots of flour now lightly flour the knife so when you slice the gnocchi it doesn't stick cut the dough into bite-sized pieces just take your finger dip it in the flour and push down why i want my nokia to look like a pillow and for me the most important part there is that not one of them are identically the same shape water on bring up to the boil little touch of olive oil in there lightly flour your hand lift up the gnocchi in to the rolling boiling water turn that pan to stop them from sticking at the bottom and let them simmer and they start to sort of tell you they're cooked when they start floating get a pan on get that nice and hot now they're just starting to come up to the top and you can continue cooking them like that i like blanching them in the water taking them out and then frying them to study the gnocchi heat olive oil in a frying pan gently lift up and look they've doubled in size drain it get rid of the excess water and straight in to the hot pan [Music] this is where they start to take on a completely different texture nice crisp sauteed texture on the outside nokia loves fresh pepper so pepper in you can see as i start turning them you've got this really nice little sort of brown color and they're almost popping up now like little parcels so i want them nice and sauteed both sides but light and creamy in the center fresh garden peas in and the butter gives it that really nice sort of bernoullisette flavour on the end beautiful a little bit of fresh thyme over the peas and then finally i want to lift it up fresh lemon zest the lemon over [Music] smells incredible and then finally seal the deal with a touch of grated parmesan cheese give your vegetable attitude and you'll get amazingly elegant dishes on a budget that are always guaranteed to impress what more do you want from great cooking keep to make easy to cook and absolutely stunning i absolutely love bacon bread there's something really satisfying about doing it and this focaccia recipe is very hands-on but the end result is something really really tasty first off start with the dough tip 500 grams of strong bread flour into a mixing bowl and add 20 grams of semolina that gives the focaccia its sort of rustic charm now there's one thing for catcher needs it's really good seasoning you can't season bread after it's baked so it's got to go in right at the very beginning sprinkling 15 grams of dried yeast take some warm water and then 50 ml of olive oil top of that water that gives it this really nice silky rich texture make a little well mix up that yeast water and oil in start off with your fingers keep your fingers nice and open it's like a little sort of whisk going in there i'm looking for a really nice sort of relaxed dough now that's just starting to come together touch more water with oil in there give it a little swirl and then again the secret is to sort of knead it gently don't overwork it it's a sort of easy bread to make a nice one to start off with when you're making bread for the first time basically kneading means just knit it together just hanging lightly flour your board and let's just knead that focaccia into a nice smooth dough make sure you don't over add too much flour otherwise it sort of dries out the dough something quite magical about making bread you can switch off and lose yourself my first job for a three mission style establishment was a baker i was 22 years of age i used to start at midnight i was under such a tight schedule one o'clock white bread done two o'clock brown bread three o'clock sourdough four o'clock cheese bread five o'clock prove bake six o'clock crack them open and taste it was amazing beautiful yeah looks stunning it hasn't even risen yet leave your dough to rise in a warm place until it's doubled in size we call this proving [Music] look at that beautiful a lot of chefs sort of need it for the second time but i'm looking for a really nice light aerated for catcher take a tray a touch of olive oil in there season it at the bottom really important that's the exciting thing about focaccio you've got that really nice sort of salty top and salty bottom and just with a touch of olive oil on your hands gently push that in and almost massage it into the corners it's possible to put sort of olives and tomatoes and garlic through the dough but it never really allows the dough to sort of bake properly when you put so much ingredients in i'm going to stick mine on top use your finger and sort of just push them in salt on top some pepper on top as well i want some nice fresh amazing rosemary just hold the stalk and just pull off and then just sprinkle down generous on the rosemary really important to have that nice fragrance on top of the fuckacha finish it off before it goes in with a little drizzle of olive oil so it almost sinks in those little pockets of flavor olive tomato rosemary and olive oil into the oven [Music] bake your focaccia at 200 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes smells delicious [Music] beautiful [Music] you can hear how crispy that is you can't beat a nice warm fresh slice of home-cooked focaccia it's rustic charming and it's the perfect way to start baking making homemade for catcher is so addictive [Music] my next amazingly aromatic recipe is roasted squash hummus [Music] start with my take on razal hanut a classic moroccan spice blend in a dry pan toast cinnamon cloves coriander fenugreek and fennel seeds then add mustard seeds and cumin when the seeds start to pop they're ready add paprika and grind into a fine powder for the hummus peel and chop butternut squash put on a baking tray and add garlic simply bashed and chopped ginger drizzle with olive oil season and sprinkle over the spice mix then roast in a hot oven for half an hour until soft allow to cool and place in a blender add tahini a nutty paste made from sesame seeds cooked chickpeas a dash of lemon juice and a drizzle of olive oil blitz until luxuriously creamy and textured spices toasted for maximum flavor amazing roasted squash hummus my next recipe takes the humble pancake to a whole new level of flavor and excitement soft fiery and irresistible spicy pancakes one of the secrets to good cooking is learning to use your imagination when it comes to brunches you don't have to stick to the old standbys these delicious spicy pancakes a really great alternative but more importantly so easy to do start off by toasting your cumin [Music] it's a dry roast basically non-stick pan just a touch of seasoning the salt helps to dry out the cumin even more and then fresh ginger slice them nice and thinly stack it back up and then just slice nice little thin slices in there and then keep that bunched up shake the chilli removing the seeds will prevent things getting too hot now garlic nice now add olive oil to your toasted cumin seeds and then with the garlic ginger and chili lovely [Music] and it feels strange when you talk about garlic for breakfast but the time i spent in india everybody was eating something savory for breakfast it was extraordinary into your bowl and set aside next the pancake filling add olive oil to a hot pan mustard seeds in now they'll start dancing the minute they hit the pan then finely slice an onion onions in a little teaspoon of turmeric sprinkle that in and look at the color an instant change leftover potatoes just slice them the smell is incredible potatoes in now spread the potatoes across the pan while the potatoes stained i want them sort of absorbing all that really nice turmeric actually like a sponge season those potatoes it really helps to bring out the spice beautifully they're ready turn off the gas and let them sit there and absorb all those flavors back to the pancake batter add plain flour to your cooled garlic chili ginger and cumin seeds touch with salt and pepper nothing worse than the bland pancake one whole egg milk hold the jug with one hand and whisk we have a secret to get that really nice smooth paste but whisk in that egg first and brings it together and then you're milking don't put all the milk in because then you're going to get a lumpy pancake mix and if you put less milk in it really helps it not going lumpy look at that milk here the secret for me is to have a nice thin mix now just a little teaspoon of oil that helps to bring a nice crispy edge to the mixture now just taste that's the texture pan on the larger the pan the better it helps to create a nice thin even surface i want that mix going all the way around the pan before you put the mixture into the pan make sure you give your pancake mix a really nice stir pan it's nice and hot turn down the gas a touch of olive oil get that nice whisk with one hand pan to the mix in one and a half ladles and then roll it around so it's really nice and thin i want to see the ginger the garlic that's what i'm looking for in there now back onto the heat it only starts to remove from the bottom of the pan and lifts itself up once it's cooked these little bubbles confirm that it's just starting to lift off the pan a little shake that releases it and then just shake it to the end and toss if you haven't got the confidence tossing then use a spatula and turn it over now that's exactly what i want that nice sort of crisp edge around the side the color on the pancake is so important now roll it round and just let it slide out beautifully now for the exciting part filling them take your potatoes just sort of have a really nice imaginary line and then just very carefully roll that nice and tightly tuck it underneath there pull it back and roll useful the delicious pancakes are ready to eat but with a simple dipping sauce there'll be a real treat just mix chopped coriander with natural yogurt that's really nice cooling agent sit there on the side and that for me is a great brunch delicious spicy pancakes amazing

amazing fermented soy bean puree into the pan three nice tablespoons gas on now get your fish stock and whisk into the puree be generous with the stock you want this nice light broth basically you can buy miso paste from big supermarkets and it works brilliantly with salmon poaching the salmon in the miso stuff gives it a really nice sort of sweet earthy creamy flavor it's incredible bring it to

beautifully now we're gonna poach the salmon poaching means cooking it in liquid but it's cooked gently and the secret here is to keep that salmon skin on if we take the skin off now the salmon can actually break up whilst it's poaching skin side down i'm just going to slide that in under nice the minute that stock starts boiling turn it down let it simmer take a little ladle and just every couple of minutes pour over that makes sure the top of the salmon is cooked evenly and keeps it nice and moist and poaching is one of the most delicate ways of cooking so you have to handle it with care whilst the salmon's poaching in the miso broth start preparing your vegetables i'm using tender stem broccoli and bak choy i always like to cook the leaf and the stem separately the leaf is like sort of spinach and the stem is so much thicker it's almost as thick as a stick of celery so i like to get the stems sliced just so i've got that nice sort of place the leaves together nicely roll them up nice and tight and then slice them down now my salad already the flavor in that broth has been elevated now it tastes really fishy got the heat the chili spiciness the ginger and the caffeine lime leaf take your fish slice and place it very gently underneath the salmon and push it down fish slices are flexible for that reason bend it lift it up just touch looking for a springy firm texture and just sit there on top a little touch of the broth over it it stops it from drying out leave that to cool down for two minutes bring the stock back up to the boil broccoli and bak choy stems in a little taste it's getting better and better and better cook the broccoli and the bok choy stems for one minute and then add the tops in turn the salmon into your hand and just peel all that skin off the skin also helps to keep the salmon nice and moist then gently flake the salmon that's the secret behind poaching everything just stays so moist wonderful long shards of pink now just before we serve we're going to add our mushrooms these are enoki mushrooms you can buy these in oaky mushrooms in big supermarkets and good grocers slice them off i'm going to put half in and the other half i'm

top the potato salad with the roasted mackerel and drizzle with more vinaigrette a healthy meal that makes the most of cheap but delicious fish stunning roasted mackerel with garlic and paprika [Music] i love this recipe why because it turns this humble ingredient a can of tuna into something delicious just open up and drain the tuna into a sieve just lightly flake that don't press it too hard otherwise you'll dry out the tuna now these are water's chestnuts just slice them nice and thin you can buy them anywhere any supermarket chestnuts in fresh ginger get rid of that rough skin on the outside by grating the ginger you get to get all that really nice sort of juice in take your spring onions and just slice on an angle i like the texture of the water chestnut with a spring onion we'll touch of fresh coriander lovely next remove the seeds from a chili to reduce its heat without losing any flavor and finely chop chilies in kaffir lime leaves roll them up nice and tight run your

two whole eggs and give that a nice little whisk and then add your eggs get your hands in there and start mixing get the mixture roll it hand to hand and the palm pat them down nicely to cook add a

cup we can find him a fairy welcome back to the f word now time for the main course uh no stop stop stop stop they're burn pad fried chicken breasts with morel sauce chicken is the nation's favorite meat we've roasted it we've stir-fried it we've curried it this is a new dimension so with a wonderful rich morel sauce just before it goes in the pan get your cloth and just pat it dry that gets rid of any excess moisture therefore when it goes in the pan it doesn't spit at you season skin side down into the pan garlic thyme knob of butter in straight into the oven eight to ten minutes 180 degrees mural sauce and the most important thing about these dried morals is you just add boiling water it rehydrates the mushroom then there's an added bonus you've got your own mushroom stock drain off and mushrooms into the pan garlic thyme splashing white wine the white wine starts to sweeten it up mushroom stock reduce cream bring that out to the boil and literally just cook it for one minute and the secret now is to pass the sauce through the sieve get your ladle and just push wonderful color not too thick and full of flavor perfect asparagus they're in season and it's british cut off the

yes yes okay look on the hot plate way deep this is what i'm trying to say but we've got things we're supposed to do you put the food in the bowl first the chicken gets sliced last yes potatoes aren't cooked mushrooms aren't out the pan and now you want to argue so i'm just trying to get you organized stop slicing the chicken for five minutes and help get the food in the [ __ ] bowl right where's the bowl watch out here is the biggest gob in the food world pressed foie gras marinated in white pool foie gras marinated in pinot noir caramel or this menu honey and soy roasted quail with foie gras and spiced pear chutney well if you ask me gordon is bloody obsessed with foie gras if you go through the menus of his restaurants photograph features on nearly every one foie gras is a foodie's delight it has a unique buttery taste and texture that makes it often irresistible but the trouble is the way that the french make it is by force feeding ducks and geese holding their beaks open and shoving down a lot of food and quite frankly that's a bit repulsive isn't it well i think the french think that foie gras is a french food nobody else can produce it and they own the copyright on it if you like but that french monopoly is now being challenged by a so-called ethical foie gras from spain i want to know if the french and spanish products can even compare if they can i'm going to challenge gordon to change his mind and his menus to get to the bottom of all this who are about foie gras i've decided to come to the heart of rural france to the door dine and pay my first visit ever to a foie gras farm [Music] [Applause] foreign it's cruel no it's not cruel it's not crap if i go there yeah and you're lucky okay look at this lot they're not rushing so that makes me think they don't really want that they are friends i'm told the birds on this farm receive six kilos of grain a day it's the actual business of putting the tube down the throat that i find quite hard to look at french farmers insist that only force feeding can create the taste and texture what seems like a cruel way of producing a delicacy is simply a continuation of a centuries-old tradition i know the most intelligent animals but they must have a little brain and do they really like this i mean the pluses have had a massive dinner the downside is their life's gonna end in a few days time he's part animal ten days more life death wrong and probably the last nightmare he's going to have his janet street porter holding him after two to three weeks of force feeding the liver is at its most engorged and the duck is slaughtered look how big it is disgusting the liver is 10 times bigger than normal and it's this unnatural amount of fat that creates the distinctive taste now i'm having second thoughts devil's food i wasn't very happy seeing how the geese were fed it's given me a lot to think about and probably i'm gonna have nightmares now not very happy about it at all and i won't be eating it anymore definitely [Music] now what's really pissed the french off is that the spanish producers have won the prestigious medal for innovation at the paris international food salon and they're not happy now it's time to put this spanish product to the test if i'm to have any hope of changing gordon's mind i've got to find him an alternative that rivals the taste of the french how many geese are here six thousand case where are they farmer eduardo explains that if we kneel down the geese will come freely to us i'm gonna pray to a ghost i can't believe i'm gonna do this each year the geese binge eat local acorns and olives to prepare for their migration so what this is like a five-star hotel luxury hotel for geese but unlike most hotels the best fed guests get slaughtered how do you know when the liver is ready when they are ready to be um they eat non-stop sounds like a lot of people i know eduardo seeing the birds in their natural environment was a refreshing sight but i couldn't help wondering would their livers be as stuffed with fat as their ethical credentials now i can already say that this is much smaller than the french liver that is an ethical goose liver but most crucially would the spanish taste as good as the french i'm gonna taste it delicious very good water well this product has got all the taste and none of the cruelty [Music] tastes bloody marvelous this is food that you can eat with a clear conscience so i'm going to go back home i'm going to bloody going to force feed it excuse me just [ __ ] off right why oh why do you have foie gras on all of your menu this is god jesus christ have you got hearing aid because you're shouting so much more than laughter because they're all frying behind have you got a hearing aid in there no of course not just they don't want me okay can we do a deal here if you can't tell the difference between the ethical foie gras and the horrible chew down your gourd foie gras okay that you serve

pleasure i love you i love it don't forget that t-shirt yes i won't thank you holy [ __ ] what in the [ __ ] is he on mine's okay a little unseated possibly but um no i really enjoyed it the potatoes were a bit hard al dente is nice for vegetables and pasta but not potatoes okay um we were slow what a shape here we go let's find out how many customers out of 50 paid for the main i mean 30 customers paid for the main course 30 30. 20 didn't sorry chef for what reason what they say so obviously too long too long again raw potatoes a bit bland yeah but we didn't have potatoes on the main meal let's get 50 out of 50 yes paying for the dessert yes next on the menu blurs alex james takes me on in the recipe challenge alex is using hay i'm not because it's [ __ ] disgusting if the cockney tits up when desserts get burnt all the others if you look i'll put them in the [ __ ] bean i missed one and i become the deer hunter now no welcome back to the f-word now time for me to beat alex james in the recipe challenge ready ready right what am i doing what are you doing alex i'm doing breast of lamb breast of lamb rolled and stuffed up with mushrooms bake it in hay on a bed of spinach with uh some baked shallots nothing fancy you are quite a secret little foodie aren't you i do love my well when you live in the country kind of life does tend to revolve around food really i mean you take all day making uh making dinner rumor has it you're turning into a bit of a sort of shoe early witting still yes the sort of the trout farm phase of the sort of rock star trajectories is inevitable as the uh sort of model chasing boozy phase you know so alex is doing the stuff breast of lamb i'm gonna do a saddle of land stuff with wild mushrooms sage a little bit of mint and some mascarpone cheese band together with some spinach um alex is using hay i'm not because it's [ __ ] disgusting why hey it's nice it gives it a nice it does give it a nice flavor i'm gonna give it a bit of a scorch so you get like caramelized hay so it's gonna be a bit sweeter you're getting really fast i'm going at the city speed you're going at the country speed yeah it's very hard for me to imagine that you're a rock star and now you're this laid back countryman can you see through all that hair alex yeah man coming through so you're looking through one eye yeah if i get this right it's flash so you've got mushrooms in there yeah just giving it a little roll nice huh it's quite a well trimmed piece actually yeah then you'll tie that in string yeah if i can that's the tricky bit excellent very chefy that you know that okay okay after so many years as a highly successful band yeah and a rock and roll lifestyle to go with it don't you miss it i kind of i wouldn't like to think there'd never be another blur record but i don't i don't sort of yearn for it no i think it's you know it's a hard thing to sort of leave behind of course but um i think it you know it's been good that there's not been sort of a blur record for a while because we all kind of needed to learn how to sort of be grown-ups yep and that looks all right yeah i tell you what from uh from a chef's point of view it looks like it's tied nice and tightly and more importantly now you've stuffed it nothing's leaking out this is right the guy who sold me my pigs i showed him this hay and he said that's too good for a pig you're serious so what do you do with the hate you've wet it alex wet it and then give it a bit of a t i haven't tried this before now you're going to set fire to it you're like a countryside arsenic i can't believe you said fire to the hattie alex it looks like a large burs nest yes so mushrooms are in there spinach is in there i'm just gonna season it now with some lightly grated nutmeg salt pepper and a tablespoon of mascarpone cheese bind all those mushrooms and the eggs together and stuff that inside the saddle of lamb alex you wrapped the breast in hay you then wrapped it in cling film now you've wrapped it in tin foil what's next carpet what are you doing look at that can't argue with that mate that's that's posh yeah that yeah but someone's gonna fold mine sage on top little phillips on top and then just wrap nice and tightly over hoping all that stays in there so the idea of the hay is to what perfume it yeah it does give it gives it a bit of flavor you know and then uh it keeps it quite moist as well actually so then you just give it a little fry at the end oh so you're crisping yours now i'm gonna criss it up get it really nice and uh crispy on the outside seasoned it and once it's all sealed then i can put it in the oven it'd be very hard to get this color on the oven straight away sure ready into the oven 30 minutes each yeah i'll go to the top shelf just in there like that yes yeah okay good yeah 30 minutes um now i want to talk to you about your unusual sort of uh calcium intake ah you once drank your wife's breast milk i did what's all that about well she had twins and she'd been in hospital for like three months with them and then she got out and went to see the foo fighters had a few beers right the milk was condemned so i didn't want to throw it away it's got to be good for you it's got uh less fat more protein it's got to be better for you than cow's milk i mean it's it's human milk you're looking at me now if you just put it in your [ __ ] new cheese recipe have you made cheese with it yet people have tried but it won't coagulate but we could do a pretty good cappuccino you up for it with breast milk rock and roll now time to see if the companies know their apples and pears [Music] apples and pears are perfect dessert for this time of year this is a braeburn apple nice and crisp full of juice hardly any acidity this is a comet's pair now quite robust quite dense in the center but the most amazing flavor very very sweet right when we caralize through you've got to core the center down in twist and pull out nice thin slices as you feel the secret behind roasting apples and pears is making sure that they're not too ripe if they're slightly too ripe then the whole thing disintegrates in the pan look at that smells amazing and now we're gonna form a really nice caramel but we're gonna season this can with black pepper star neat and close and that gives a really nice spice flavor when you're caramelizing the apples and pears pan sugar get it really nice and even therefore the caramel starts cooking evenly and doesn't burn in the corners butter stops it from separating and splitting spice cinnamon stick pears and apples in put the fat side down and now that i'm happy with that color i'm going to add my calvados and it sort of enriches the camera jesus [Music] then finished with apple juice it just sort of liquefies the caramel and just takes the heaviness out of it bring that to the boil and just coat the apples and pears and let it glaze over and serve that smells amazing now just finish that with some ice cream on caramelise apples and pears with ice cream done we serve the madeline because it's a really nice accompaniment it's like a nice little sort of baked sponge once you've tasted the perfect madeline yes trust me you'll never ever forget it 50 like that and they're all going to pay for it yes yes yes right first of all madeline's in one mile do you mean that i've pulled all the pays i'm doing the payments i'm doing the atkins apple juice last wash your fingers pull it back get the bottle away from the flame you'll go up in a [ __ ] oh that's it let's go should we send that please keep the pan don't toss it with cavitos in there you'll [ __ ] set yourself on fire come on we can do this girl come on come here come on come on come on careful careful careful careful careful you're gonna really hurt yourself yeah very careful now everyone's laughing and [ __ ] around let me just show you something hello look there you go yeah that's just come back so john please turn it open check it right now right now you're all making yourself look [ __ ] stupid okay so hey i know no no don't chef me no yeah don't check me there because i didn't have nowhere to put the other twice quickly listen listen don't serve black madeline's end the story okay chef that was a mishap all the others if you look i'll put them in the [ __ ] bin i missed one sorry come back yeah guys i said i missed one every other madeline that's burned is in the bin i threw him in there a monster at least one just sent it back no i'm not arguing i'm apologizing because i thought because i thought i got them all off that's the standard of your apology hello hey sorry chef i am sorry chef all right these ones are burnt as well chef could that be the big one there you go have a look right are they burnt aren't they [ __ ] underneath while deer are the most loved and respected of game [Music] they're beautiful majestic creatures whilst their meat is widely regarded as the most regal of delicacies now i've been given the chance to hunt and kill a deer myself i'm in the middle of forest here in thetford right in the heart of norfolk i've never shot a deer i've never been stalking before and i cannot wait i've always wanted to stalk wild deer it's one of the ultimate standoffs between man and beast a centuries-old tradition with a huge payoff a chance to eat some of the finest game in the world [Music] alan how are you sir hi gordon welcome to that expert deer hunter alan mccormick is going to show me the ropes it doesn't sound easy and what you're looking at doing is lining up on the back of the leg right and it's a third to halfway up and essentially that's going to go through the vital organs of the heart and lungs and the deer and that's a clean that's a clean shot okay good excellent how exciting you know you can see that okay nice and steady three nut breezes squeeze when you're ready stags can weigh up to 350 kilo almost four times my weight and it takes great skill to kill a fully grown deer humanely and of course the problem is is that if you need that second shot we need to then sort it out quickly i only hope i can make the all-important clean kill when it's my time to pull the trigger oh [ __ ] i can't see any holes there oh there's one there's two oh three goals now every one of those shots would have taken that deer and killed it really outright you're obviously a driven and competitive person this isn't a competition we've got to wait till this is all right absolutely and every time it's right then it's fine shots on we take off well done we'll hunt for real tomorrow in the meantime alan's got some fresh venison liver from a kill first thing this morning it will make the perfect hunter's meal what fascinates me with this particular dish is that the deer stalkers back in the early days would sort of treat this as their main meal fry up some shallots pancetta a bit of wild garlic and some mushrooms that smells [ __ ] delicious just leave them there i'm just going to do a really nice sort of crouton for the bacon to sit on into the olive oil and now for the liver it's times like this i feel a little bit like hannibal lecter nice big thick slices it's really important when you're cooking with liver just season the liver at the very last minute otherwise it dries out look at the colour of that liver one minute each side pan smoking almost treat it like you're cooking a nice piece of fillet steak a tail piece of fillet and i'll tell you what it doesn't become any fresher than that i'm surprised there's no more deer that rock up that smells amazing right look at that man that's so rich that is nice that really is nice it's off to bed early to rise the stalk starts at dawn we need to be really quiet here okay you could have a deer at any point anywhere the plan is to stalk in silence before we see a deer then take aim and fire but with a film crew a thick mist and my inexperience that's easier said than done there's two deer just down the side of the field [ __ ] they're just gone [Music] after two hours of trudging around on the ground we still had no luck it was time to move to a high seat which in this weather should give us more chance okay take as much time as you can need oh what's that there yeah it's a hair i love her look good lovely hannah wasn't he can i take him out no you bloody won't yeah what do you do when you're this high up on your desperate need for number two oh there you go it's just come out and stuff yeah steady steady steady it's all right but they may come back again i know it's too far there it is steady there they are steady for a clean quick kill idea needs to be side on and standing still come on little bastard turn side on no no no no no so frustrating damn there is a condition called buck fever and it's essentially when people get excited and they're about anticipation and adrenaline of trying to a bit like a book now exactly there's another one there's another one anytime now finally after hours of stalking i had the perfect clear shot of a beautiful wild deer in my sides but something didn't feel right you're gonna have to do it shortly instead of pulling the trigger i took my finger off it that was really frustrating after all those hours spent stalking the deer and then the chase is exciting there's no toys about that that's very sort of boyish but it's really weird when you get it in your sight and you think god should pull that trigger or not i don't know maybe i'm becoming a vegetarian [Music] next on the menu alex james tries to persuade me breast is best i really like it alex itching to know who owns my new pasture i feel like i'm on through the keyhole gordon i can't imagine who lives here someone with a bit more taste than you that's for sure are you such a [ __ ] and the eastenders find out if they've done well enough to come back and cook in my west end restaurant results of the desserts out of 50

Gordon Ramsay's Ultimate Fit Food/Healthy, Lean and Fit – http://po....",2022-12-04 22:16:02.927159, my all-time favorite shepherd's pie what's the secret behind a really good shepherd's pie i would think the vegetables you use and growing in it so we're going to use leeks and onions and they'll start browning off the mints you know no color no flavor i've never forgotten that you know that yep so good to have color gotta have color otherwise it puts that grey tinge on the shepherd's pie that looks greasy and cheap and nasty they don't want that julie and i know you don't do cheap or nasty let me clear your peelings now huh all right thank you very much there's no nails in there now is there no don't be cheeky i remember your amazing shepherd's pie and that lovely little restaurant used to work in sheep street in stratford so you never got food sent back no sometimes they complained that there were you never ever got a complaint no how long have you worked at that restaurant for six shoes six years oh hello chilly what are you cooking i'm gonna make okay i sort of modern version of nanny's shepherd's pie dad shouldn't manny be doing the cooking because she's the better cook excuse me right mum would you would you top our uh our onion please daddy yeah oh gosh your eyes are gonna water in there we've got a delicious steamed treacle and date pudding let's just separate it for you um how do skeletons call their friends how do skeletons call their phone i'm not too sure on the scalabone i'm just gonna tilly come on okay so two cats are in a race one is called one two three and the other is called under 12. who won depends who's the fastest cat one two three because under 12 cats sank [Music] oh goodness tells why do you make a nice cup of tea for nanny you want me to disappear thank you bye so give that a little fry off okay mm-hmm nice quarter these jokes they get worse oh she's only having a bit of fun sauce worcester sauce that's gonna give that really nice spicy seasoning oh thank you okay yeah tomato puree in you could put a ton of tomatoes in this if you want you could yeah put that mince back in there once it's drained i'm just going to put a little touch i know you'll go crazy at this a little touch of red wine really why the red wine well because i'm going to make it nice and rich okay produce the red wine down yeah and then start covering your with your stock now i'm gonna bring that up to the bowl okay and then get some fresh rosemary okay like it'll taste yes please is it hot it's a little bit hot be careful as it cooks out the wine and the alcohol will disappear it'll be delicious trust me now good spring onions we'll chop up and that's going to go through the mashed potatoes it's going to sit on top of that nicer i like that savory yeah delicious mince that's laced with all that red wine nice so sprinkles into there please mum and i'm going to drain off the potatoes hi there hello hello oh hi jack hi hi hello hello jack have a nice day school yeah yeah so we'll dry out those potatoes and then mash them no oh can i mash them would you okay um holly slice a little knob of butter in there for jack please so what was the restaurant you worked out there were you a chef cook i love the diplomacy were you a chef i was a cookie exactly that not really you used to help me as little right you kids do no potatoes these are nice and fluffy are they aren't they and do you want mom look delicious mashed potatoes yeah with no lumps in there hey weren't you getting it huh it's great having you back in the kitchen mommy now yeah seriously brings back good memories no just why'd you do that dad i just wanted to fork it to get it nice and spiky so i want that nice crispy topping and then lightly grate that cheddar cheese on top and that goes in the oven literally 20 minutes 180 minutes jack can you on the door please that looks lovely doesn't it even though you said you didn't like it earlier okay back in the day mama's meals all came with two veg and this is no different but with a modern twist braised peas and carrots with a fantastic homemade mint butter shepherd's pie glazed on top that looks lovely doesn't it and then the carrots that's why i didn't put carrots in let's put them on the side i'll see last job before serving pour that gorgeous butterscotch sauce over the pudding okay i'll take one at a time that smells incredible this is my ultimate childhood dinner shepherd's pie with crispy cheese champ topping sweet buttery peas and carrots [Music] that is the most amazing pork butt butts away butts away now this is incredible there's the shoulder yeah and look there's the shoulder blade if you go through here there's a knuckle there that's connecting the top and that's why it's called a butt the slower you cook it the more juicy it is and it's great for big parties because you just come along and get your fork and shred it a delicious smoky mayonnaise and you're away onions into half and half again okay i'm gonna leave the roots on okay because i want this to sit underneath the pore it gives it a chance to cook evenly and doesn't get dry in the bottom really important okay now i'll peel the garlic okay i'd like you and to crush the garlic we're gonna make a really nice little paste okay go on maggie come on come on come on nice good girl one more crush come on miggy now this is a beauty paprika smoked paprika i love it so three nice tablespoons in okay two large tablespoons of brown sugar salt please and pepper could go [Laughter] so gonna form a nice paste now olive oil in mix that some thyme in there so we've got a sort of fragrant rub time stalks underneath so that's even more flavor going on on the bottom pour that all over it now this is where you've got to be really quick okay and sort of rub that mashed sausage in almost exactly that smells amazing honestly you just drizzle a little touch of olive on top of that for me i keep the pork nice and moist lovely like some of the best party dishes the marinading of the pork shoulder can be done days in advance so if i was doing this for a sunday and start marinating thursday friday so it gets even tastier right quite easy as well to make it's very easy five and a half to six hours in the oven at 140. while our pork butt slowly roasts meg and i are going to pimp some shot-bought mayonnaise i don't like just plain mayonnaise there's so many things you have to twist to us yeah there's so many things something exciting you can do with it right salt pepper and little touch of honey sweetness yeah sweetness but there's some heat coming okay and i've got a little bit off you love this chipotle smoked chipotle paste i love that once you've made this dressing you know it can sit in the fridge great for open sandwiches yeah you can use it for any sandwiches really any sandwiches but goes brilliantly well with pork now just have a little taste i've never had this before it's so good a nice spoon of mustard so that's our nice spicy mayonnaise after five and a half hours in the oven our pork is nearly ready just time to knock up a couple of tried and tested party favorites first deliciously simple cheesy crushed potatoes cut potatoes into even chunks and submerge in salted boiling water skins and all meanwhile finely dice sweet pickled gherkins or cornichons trim and finely chop spring onions and grate some nutty gruyere cheese when the potatoes are cooked through drain roughly crush and add your spring onions and gherkins [Music] season to taste and gently combined before a final sprinkling of grated greer these simple cheesy crushed potatoes are equally delicious served hot or cold now i want something sort of raw like a slaw something quite refreshing yeah so i'm gonna make a really nice fresh broccoli salad now these are called florets and that's the best part of the broccoli okay the bit that everybody wants once they're off i'm going to slice the broccoli okay mm-hmm never had raw broccoli before it's always been cooked really when you dress this with the dressing it's incredible now a little season early on yeah okay now for the dressing fresh yogurt in a teaspoon of sugar please daddy a little smell cider vinegar mmm there you go finely chop shallot in with the broccoli so delicious roasted almonds into the broccoli currants i love them that gives that nice sort of chewy texture all right lift up your bowl please nice and gently half of that in the middle please thank you and stop and then mix that up with me a little taste so good and this kind of salad it doesn't wilt a couple of hours later it's still crunchy because the broccoli is raw raw broccoli salad chipotle now let me be the poor cow for this look at this megan honestly that is amazing it's beautiful that is incredible [Music] now that goes to the table like that i thought let's have a tiny bit just before we go to the table just a little bit honestly meg don't tell mom thank you honestly do i do it i'm gonna do it that is incredible so good you promise me you don't give the recipe to your boyfriend let's go come on this is my ultimate easy party dinner melt in your mouth slow cook smokey pulled pork with a spicy chipotle mayonnaise first job i have pomegranate marinade for the quail which have been cut in half and flattened so small aren't they small yeah it's tiny so it's almost like a sort of nice entrance into eating something slightly gamey okay if you give them a nice season for me salt and pepper and all spatchcock means is the rib cage has been taken out and they're flattened down and because the bird is so delicate it's flattened to cook evenly and it really is a nice sort of light gamey dense chicken flavor so we're toaster spices when you think of middle eastern food it's packed with amazing flavors tablespoon of coriander a teaspoon of cumin and a nice little seasoning of salt so we toast them now intensifying the flavor when they start smoking lightly that's a nice indication that they're ready okay if you grind away so the best thing there let's just stand up close today thank you oh look your tummy's out i thought it was a quail tummy this hand here keeps it nice and firm and you grind that into a nice powder for belly please smells so good doesn't it yeah so to get that in really go around the outside and that grinds it up i've gone around the pestle mortar more times than you kiss boys squeeze the garlic in next a little glove okay then i want you to pour six tablespoons please so that is pomegranate molasses so it's like an aged parsley vinegar but really reduced down give that a nice mix up is it going to be very sweet dad a little taste it's sweet but sour yeah it is it's so good though no take a nice spoon put it inside the quail you can even do this the night before because you pop them in the fridge let the quail marinate anywhere from half an hour to overnight for my ultimate middle eastern dessert it's got to be baklava start by melting butter in a pan chop pistachios in a blender [Music] then combine with caster sugar and lemon zest [Music] brush the melted butter around a small baking tray place half a sheet of phyllo pastry on the base brush well with melted butter and sprinkle with a pistachio mix repeat and press down between layers you're looking to create 30 to 35 layers [Music] then cut the baklava into bite-sized rectangles and bake in a preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes meanwhile make your delicious citrusy syrup simply add water to a pan along with caster sugar and the zest and juice of a lemon simmer for seven to ten minutes making sure the sugar has fully dissolved now to give the cloud a wonderful sweetness remove from the oven and whilst hot pour over the syrup so each layer is gloriously sticky leave the paklava to absorb the syrup for at least 12 hours these delicious sticky treats will keep for a week but they're so moorish they'll be gone in a flash the quails have marinated now they're ready to cook nice hot pan pick up your quail and skin side down first okay get all that nice color and always open them up as well in the pan okay we'll get that skin crisp crispy that's right smell that pomegranate i can really smell it it smells so good you get all that marinade in there you know cook with it as well don't waste it how long on average does it take to cook could you say literally 12-15 minutes in the oven a little touch of water in bring that up to the ball into the oven 180 so 12 to 15 minutes [Applause] okay the final job before serving a herby butter bean salad to go with my quail in pomegranate molasses now one of the things that i love about middle eastern salads is the sort of crunch and the color as well butter beans it's gonna be the base of our salad from their little radishes and sort of top and tail them get them like that and throw them in there's nothing small and dainty in there okay yeah so with the spring onions nice we're gonna use the greens and the whites i'm gonna slice along that way this time to get those nice light shards okay yeah now the croutons are made out of these little pita breads just slice lengthways in with the salad oh yes so this salad is all about texture so cucumber okay and take out the seeds how come you're taking the seeds out it just makes the salad very watery like a shower okay cucumber juice delicious i guess you go yeah you got me going you really got me going no no no oh yeah i've got revision to be doing don't worry this is far more important trust me who needs exams where you can cook for a living you gave me with my exams it's fine it's fine it's fine be a chef for a living have a proper job don't take your things out like that you'll be thumbless let's go now your cucumber in from there take your nice vibrant tomatoes slice down it almost looks like a greek salad as those colors it resembles that that's right and with the celery like before yeah lengthways so we need some mint and parsley i want you sprinkling it in there and really mix it through the herbs give it that nice kind of freshness but i want a bit of a bite in there now i love pomegranate so just carefully open that up okay and then just dot them on top so we got a bit of fruitiness now into the salad for crunch simply cut up whole pita breads fry in a really hot pan with olive oil until wonderfully golden crispy and irresistible out into a sieve okay next a sprinkle of sumac that's a dried fruit from middle east the zest of a lemon and the juice then a drizzle of olive oil and last but not least my crunchy pitter croutons let's make the croutons on well they've gotten hard oh just lift that up and mix in your hands there nice and juicy just with fingertips there you go so you just mix there you go it doesn't crush anything it doesn't crush anything but then let's just take a little bean wow isn't that delicious mm-hmm nice now quail it's got that really sort of toasted almost like a sort of light smells so good barbecue flavor can't wait to try it beef wow and then just finely a bit of lemon zest it just lightens everything up a little bit and it goes so well with the pomegranate now just wow that'll smell better than any boyfriend you'll ever have oh my god i beg to differ okay good let's go how delicious is that so delicious my middle eastern feast of quail with a pomegranate molasses and butter bean salad with batava to follow when dishes are this aromatic and colorful there's no wonder that middle eastern food is always a

Gordon Ramsay's Ultimate Fit Food/Healthy, Lean and Fit...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.927159, kicking things off with a beautiful breakfast of eggs benedict with crispy parmesan the secret behind a great eggs benedict is in the hollandaise so get your pan on because i'm going to cook our hollandaise over a rolling boil with a glass bowl butter just put it on to melt three egg yolks separated from the white tarragon vinegar pop that into the eggs if you can't get tarragon vinegar any white wine vinegar will do just as long as you've got that acidity in there give some bite to the hollandaise put your bowl over the rolling water and just start whisking if the eggs had direct contact with the gas hollandaise will become scrambled egg once you've got that nice creamy texture a nice thick savion start adding your butter nice and slowly a couple of tablespoons of butter in and give that a really nice mix if you don't whisk it enough the egg yolks don't take the butter it causes it to split with more butter using a big balloon whisk like this one makes it easier to incorporate air and helps prevent your mixture from separating all the butter in and the best way to keep hollandaise nice and warm is just leave it to sit over that nice warm water bath and it just keeps at a really nice room temperature a nice pinch of salt fresh pepper and then fresh lemon juice that just really makes it vibrant exciting i want it's like a sort of thick custard i just want it to coat the back of the spoon so it's like you're giving the a nice glossy texture to your beautiful poached egg now as the base for the egg benedict you cannot beat english muffins but the ham i'm gonna change i'm gonna use the most amazing parma ham get your pan nice and hot into the pan it's like posh rashes are bacon beautiful [Music] while i am fried nice and crisp like that is incredible beautiful in salads fantastic for eggs benedict [Music] now keep that pan nice and hot i want all that flavor from the parma ham left in there and rather than toast my muffins i want to put the muffins into the pan and i'm sucking up all that wonderful flavor from that crispy parmesan make sure your muffins are toasted nicely this will prevent them going soggy later look at that nice and crisp now water on to boil for the eggs nicely seasoned really important and then just a little splash of vinegar in the water that helps to set the egg white the minute you crack it in while the water heats up in the pan there's time to get organized lay a nice slice of ham on the base now water's brought up to the ball turn it down and then spin your water around like a little whirlpool then get a little cup so you just drop the cup in and look what happens to the egg gets caught up in the turbulence of the water the secret is not the ball the water rapidly because the strength of the ball can literally explode your egg as they start to move the way up to the top of the water that's a indication that they're cooked take off any excess little bits of egg white and then out onto a piece of tissue paper that just drains off excess water that stops your muffin from getting really soggy but look they're like little beautiful mozzarella balls give them a little season lift them on to your crispy parmesan useful now get a nice spoon of your hollandaise glaze over try and do it in one glazing over the whole egg [Applause] when i tell jack holly and megan and matilda that we're cooking eggs benedict for breakfast they bolt down the stairs and let's be honest who wouldn't run to sit in front of those [Music] special occasion breakfast that would make anyone feel spoiled eggs benedict with crispy parmesan [Music] i'm going to start with the pasta sauce i love the indulgence in this dish if i was doing this for the kids i'd scrap the vodka and just do like a virgin mary but it's a bit of a grown-ups dish now pan nice and hot splash of olive oil onions in seasoning touch of salt and pepper garlic be nice and generous with the garlic it's not just your average tomato sauce it's a royal stunning tomato sauce and you're in for a big treat season your onions and garlic the tabasco that'll give that really nice lift little pinch of celery salt spice that up with worcester sauce it instantly colors the tomatoes goes brilliantly well with a celery salt tabasco and that nice caramelized garlic a little light sprinkling of sugar all the worcester sauce has reduced down we've got this nice sweet spicy sticky garlicky onion base glaze with a couple of spoons of vodka in lovely chopped tomatoes in little touch of water look at the color of that sauce check the seasoning that's delicious bring that up to the boil and cook it out six to eight minutes reduce it down slowly turn down the gas let that simmer with my sauce simmering i can move on to a delicious breadcrumb topping to dress my linguini i'll fry off my breadcrumbs get them nice and crispy but don't put too much oil in there otherwise the bread will just absorb it they become greasy beautifully season them and they go really nice and golden brown 30 seconds before they come out flat leaf parsley roll that through your breadcrumbs and that is going to finish the linguini on top you can hear how crispy they are before i cook the linguini i'm going to make the chili butter that will flavor my lobster get your chili and slice it i want to take advantage of all those seeds chili in a touch of salt a nice clove of garlic i get some parsley [Music] start breaking that down but i'm looking for a lovely garlic chili paste exactly like that now don't overdo it with the butter herb butters are a great way to flavor fish and meat they can be used as a stuffing in dishes like chicken kiev or added towards the end of a dish as a delicious glaze lobsters they're already cooked so firmly place the lobster flat on your board there's a little crisscross here line there and line going across put the point of the knife in and just push through the head turn the lobster around cut through the lobster snap the legs off snap the claws off just get the back of your knife crack them spread that beautiful butter on go into the heads as well and then the claws take off bits of the shell and get little bits of butter in there this can be done way in advance for me the longer that chili butter sits on top of that lobster the better the flavor especially when they hit the grill while my lobster firms up in the fridge i can finish cooking my linguini water brought up to the boil seasoned nicely and a little touch of olive oil now linguine in first that's going to take the longest eight to ten minutes in as linguine starts softening at the bottom just gently turn that around always wait the linguine is nice and soft that way you don't break those nice strands give that a good mix get your lid back on [Music] and bring that to the ball rapidly after eight to ten minutes my linguini should be perfect you want it al dente slightly firm not too chewy absolutely spot on drain that into a colander shake a little bit of water from the pasta into my sauce and she goes start twisting the linguini around i want that bloody mary spicing up the linguini always hold up the center of the pan first and place it onto the plate let go of that nice big lump by doing this you'll get a mountainous pile of spaghetti with more body then generously cover that with your crispy breadcrumbs absolutely beautiful last but not least i need to cook my chilled herb buttered lobsters on a smoking hot griddle that butter's gotten really nice and firm so the idea is snapping that down and grilling the smell of that chili and garlic butter is extraordinary because the lobster's cooked all you're doing is grilling that delicious spicy chili butter you just want that mark of the char quickly on the lobster turn that over smell is incredible now get that on [Music] you can understand why it is proper special occasion food because that is mind-blowing [Music] griddled lobster with chilli and garlic butter served with a boozy bloody merry linguine a sensational special occasion lunch on the menu is a succulent rare beef fillet with salsa velvee served with roasted truffle new potatoes dishes designed to make your special occasion one to remember and to end our ramsey get together with a bang i've enlisted willing sous chef jack to help me make a sublime chocolate and pistachio semi-freddo i know you love chocolate right we'll break this up so it melts nice and evenly all right that goes over a memory and you can't put the chocolate in direct contact with the gas yeah okay otherwise it will split crack four eggs in every blue one of course hold on like that on the side and then your fingers in and pull out okay good nice now you're cracking eggs with one hand nice one i need some muscles okay start whisking and i'll fold in a bit of sugar come on let's do 30 seconds each ready okay come on jack give it some 13 year old welly come on some muscles 10 seconds to go nine eight seven six five four three two one all right here you go you're telling me sugar let's go you see the secret to whisking vigorously is changing hands every ten seconds yep now i'm gonna start the chocolate i'll stir that for you i'm just showing up no just shut it off now the secret behind this is getting it really nice and thick and that's like a stabbing on okay your turn come on change change again yeah of course also the chocolate leave that to slightly cool down a touch from there cream in why putting the cream in separately because i'm gonna get it nice and thick first if you start whisking that i'm gonna get in the vanilla to maximize the flavor from a vanilla bean cut the pot in half lengthways and scrape out those wonderfully aromatic seeds for extra flavor put the pod in as well but remember to take it out once it's infused so we've got three components the melted chocolate yes sugar yes and the eggs whipped up and the cream with the vanilla next mix in your melted chocolate with the sugar and egg saber on so you got a nice rich chocolate ganache smell how delicious i'm now i'm putting the cream and so you just whisk that in now look at that how gorgeous is that looking and that my son is a chocolate semifreddo now they taste [Music] pistachios right sprinkle them in now get your baking tray you line that with cling film so it's easy to pull out once it sets and then you just pour that in that is a real treat so you fold that over okay is this like ice cream in any way yeah as it sets you slice it it's like this nice chocolate ice block delicious then put your semifredo into the freezer for around three hours to set right jack get that pan nice and hot recognize that fillet of beef this is a rolls royce cup of beef so we've got to treat it with some respect okay yeah mop up all that seasoning yeah into the pan and get that really nice and hot hello teal kiss [Music] a little bit of garlic and thyme in there cooking with these aromatic herbs and garlic will add flavor to the beef because it's a fillet of beef there's hardly any fat on there so you sear it quickly ends as well gets seared i'm gonna now put some butter in there continue frying all those herbs now baste that with the butter see dad are we just having this are we gonna have something with it now we're gonna serve some beautiful baked potatoes with truffle and a salsa verde into the oven eight to ten minutes that's all next my super special baked new potatoes wash and drain small new

until crisp on the outside and soft all the way through transfer to your serving dish and grate over fresh parmesan cheese last but not least shave gorgeous earthy black truffle slivers onto the cheesy potatoes bake new potatoes with a lavish twist indulgent but couldn't be simpler to make right salsa birthday anchovies little touch of anchovy oil in there okay i love anchovies after that we've got some capers garlic in with the anchovies and the capers okay a touch of salt one only a touch because you could just soften the actually that's right well then diesel mustard cherry vinegar give that a nice mix and now this is where it starts to go to a completely different level some fresh mint and some fresh parsley i want half of it in there pureed a touch of olive oil in there in the rest of the mint of salt pepper [Music] what's it taste like fat hmm might need to try a tiny bit more just to check stop you can't kiss any boys now before the kids polish off all the sounds of elder

that color when you buy a paste done absolutely beautiful now marinade in the halibut yogurt paste lemon sugar just to sort of chill the flavor of the heat with all the spices mix look at that color

main problem with time during the day we actually get about maybe half an hour for lunch we don't really know how to cook healthy food quickly at all that's why we're at the moment in the short gap

menu james may drinks his way through the recipe challenge if you win this [ __ ] challenge i'm gonna go imagine that it's time for dessert scotch pancakes with caramelised bananas and i go hunting with a winged assassin he's got it he's got it bloody good catch [Applause] welcome back to the f-word now time for the recipe challenge and my challenger is james may yes captain slow so we may be here for a long time ready i'm ready how long will it take to make the fish pie normally about four hours four hours yeah bloody hell i'll do it one stage at a time you know because i'm a pedant and then i go to the pub so you're slow at driving and cooking slower everything cool so james is doing a fish pie i'm going to do something very very similar except i'm going to do a bit of a cream sauce fresh basil new season peas grain mustard that's the little sort of piss the resistance i just heard you describing yours mine is nothing like as elaborate that mine is fish with potato in the form of a pie can i open this do you want to have a bottle opener i have i've got my own it's a proper waiter's friend but it's got two steps in it which makes a difference in engineering terms so what fish have you got in the pie um i've got undyed smoked haddock nice and um uh some white fish i've got some shallots some fennel in here just gonna sweat them down a little bit of salt and pepper a little bit of thyme and then i'm going to add the nolipra this is a verma and that's going to help make the sauce well all i've done so far is peeled roughly peeled and chopped up my potatoes and my sweet potato which is this thing i've only used half of one that's just to inform the flavor of the traditional mashed potato now i'm gonna poach my fish so you're cooking your fish in milk james is that right yeah this milk that the fish is poached in will also become the basis of the sort of sauce thing that fills up the the bulk of the part i don't really know what i'm talking about to be honest usually by the time i get this far i'm so drunk i can't remember what i've done i'm gonna poach the prawns just in seasoned water there a little bit of lemon thyme literally 30 seconds [ __ ] the prawns i forgot the prawns man james are you swearing in my kitchen sorry you're putting the prawns into the milk yes yeah and the prawns are cooked already i know but they've just got to heat through don't say i didn't it makes me feel a lot more confident that's very fast james there i think i'm the first person in britain to actually see captain slow go fast yeah look at the speed of that knife well it's because i've got the knife very sharp right these are ready me rouey thing isn't thickening up gordon is that the roommate thing james you're the ruin right now the rooi the roo roux the roo okay the roux is not going very thick it's a bit sloppy does that matter uh depends how thick you want your pie the prawns are done are they yeah you're right they have shrunk i cocked that up a bit didn't i just to finish all the potatoes now a little bit of grated nutmeg james do you always drink like this when you're cooking doll's the horror of the food that i'm going to eat later obviously if you win this [ __ ] challenge you know i'm going to go mad you know that i swear to god just watching you yeah seriously drink taste drink taste drink taste drink taste extraordinary no that's great nice yeah all i need to do is put my multi-colored mashed potatoes on the top and a bit of cheese is that how you normally do paste it on yeah well i asked you like a [ __ ] plaster now this is the bit you can obviously honestly i would like a i'd like this would you like a trowel no i'd like a chef's tip how do i do the middle this is the bit that i've always struggled with i would suggest you put it in your hand cut it out paste it on there patch it out pat it out on and what james if i lose against that seriously yeah i'm going to give up cooking look mine against yours yeah i know they're not cooked yet but look at the color in mind though i mean that's pretty pretty cool there's a hair in it there i don't want any [ __ ] hairs in my fish pipe please quickly no bug right can we get in the [ __ ] oven now no james look at the time he's got to write a word on the top what are you putting on top [ __ ] i've had that there next to yours the last 10 minutes i hope the [ __ ] it doesn't affect it yes with shitness right ready for the oven now yes where is it uh uh i'll go bottom you'll go bottom right you've got your oven too hot yeah no it's on 200 we've got to speed up a little bit james just want it on about 80. okay both pies in for half an hour oh thank you yes half an hour later blind tasers will taste them and then you'll lose okay how can you call yourself a chef ramsay you haven't had a single drink this series i'm hunting high and low for great ingredients i'm on my way to norfolk in search of something quite unique something that means a lot to me hair is my favorite type of game they're bigger and tastier than rabbit but running at 40 miles an hour they're harder to hunt [Music] [Applause] i'm not going to be shooting the hair i'm going to be using a bird of prey to sort of hunt it down shooting hair often results in a spoiled carcass and hunting hair with dogs have been banned by using a bird of prey the meat is killed cleanly and swiftly in a totally natural way from a chef's point of view a dream come true i'm going to see george hedges who's been a falconer all his life [Music] [Applause] all these birds are lean mean killing machines but to take down a ham i need something bigger than a falcon something huge the ultimate bird of prey the golden eagle look at the size of it this is finick he's absolutely [ __ ] gorgeous look at the size of him extraordinary god it's amazing yeah i'm going to put that there the bro will step on jack glove yep okay can you hold him with that there and you can feel the power [ __ ] okay yeah that's 3 000 pound yummy now right tell you what let's even get invited around oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] hold on tight here we go it's okay now it's time for the hunt once the eagle's airborne it's just a matter of time until he spots her hair okay effortless isn't it oh come here old bastard but once he's made the kill you've got to be quick before the powerful bird rips its prey and your dinner apart oh he's got it hey he's got it he's got it [Music] bloody good catch oh my god he's dead yep yep here's dave bloody hell you can see how quickly it's evolving that already no lead shot anywhere no nothing blasted we'd never use the head anyway but that's one perfect hair terrific just so quick it is brilliant i'm going to take the hair back home and hang it for a couple of days to improve the flavor then i'm going to cook it for the kid's tea that's the saddle and with that we're going to do the most amazing frequency of hair with a rich dark chocolate sauce and look very gamey it's very rich very lean that is a jewel in any kitchen i throw in some shallots new season turnips garlic and a little sugar crush some juniper berries and black peppercorns and chop some rosemary now look at that wow everything in that pan is so delicious and gives a really nice foundation to a quick frequency with the hair now it's time for the kill loin in one and a half to two minutes in there the sad thing about hair never gets looking because everyone's fascinated with rabbit very lean packed with protein and incredibly good for you pour some red wine into the pan and reduce it add our chicken stock bring it up to the ball and then thicken it with a bit of magic chocolate bitter chocolate add the hair and throw in some parsley all right guys dinner time tilly what do you think it is potatoes no fried meg the shore's smell done gravy jack tilly do you like that it's hair i never guessed that you've got chocolate in your nose listen listen 45 out of 50 main absolutely [ __ ] brilliant yeah 33 out of 50 disappointing pull it back now in the desert okay yes let's go justin six portions away susan yeah work together six portions away yeah last course big moment come on check out that caramel burn girl we've got that right time for dessert scotch pancakes we caramelize bananas and rum and vanilla ice cream pancakes why do we only eat them february once a year strove tuesday which is crazy this is an american style pancake light fluffy and absolutely delicious start off with 150 grams of flour and sieve the flour as you pour into the bowl baking powder keeps the pancake really nice and light and fluffy salt three eggs 75 mils of water and 120 ml of buttermilk and the secret behind this pancake mix is to make sure that we've got no lumps anywhere whisk the eggs into the flour get your buttermilk just add half of it in give it a really good whisk that's nice and smooth already the rest of the buttermilk and when you make your pancake mix like this it's chemistry so follow the recipe exactly now we've got this really nice smooth batter that's ready perfect non-stick pan sunflower oil and just run that round half a ladle in a minute and a half on each side palette knife in and over look absolutely beautiful onto the plate this is where it gets really exciting we're caramelizing bananas it's important to slice them lengthways in order to make sure that they don't go mushy in the pan i'm going to make a really nice quick caramel 50 grams of sugar back onto the heat and start the camera don't whisk it don't put a spoon in there just leave it in the pan once you're happy with the color take it back off the heat butter bananas i'm gonna do now is deglaze the pan with some rum rum banana caramel it goes brilliantly ramen nice lovely think of the flavor a little cup of water just to let the caramel down so it's not too sticky and rich and too thick there we go that's ready be generous with them because it is just the ultimate indulgence and then finally to finish it some really nice ice cream on top and drizzle that over very very quick and easy scotch pancakes caramelised bananas with rum and vanilla ice cream done beautiful no one of the americans are so [ __ ] fat the caramel gets too hot take the pan off yes you're more than capable of doing this yeah don't panic yeah oh [ __ ] let's go move your ass turn it down it's too hot

something very quickly for me please yes [ __ ] up out of it please oh my god i don't just want the sheep in my back garden to grow i want them to grow up happy welsh lambs charlotte and gavin are now eight weeks old and supplementing their milk with spring grass they're grown rapidly but i'm worried they may be finding life in my garden a bit dull compared to the welsh mountains so i've asked my friend hugh early wittenstahl to come and check they're active enough it's amazing how quick they're growing you know yeah what do you think what i can say is that those lambs are growing well yes no question i mean you're slightly skeptical about the back garden i'm very skeptical but they are wild you've got wild sheep in the suburban garden i mean it's not like they're having a miserable time here no not so but it's it's not a welsh hillside is it what we just need to do here i think it's a little bit of environmental enrichment wanted to give the sheep a bit of extra stimulation by giving them something to climb on there's your welsh mountain oh [ __ ] they're having a laugh should we go and brew up a couple yes look gordon one of the lambs is sniffing the mountain she's interested look yes yes yes yes yes [Applause] our little playground gives my lambs a chance to tone up exercise and generally enjoy life a bit more this is literally the joys of spring that we might have found a way to keep charlotte and gavin amused but they're stuck with the old lawn my back gardens begin to look a bit threadbare i can't believe how quick they eat look how patchy it is already there's not much left is that you know if they stay here much longer you won't have a lawn and they won't have anything to eat we've got something to try and keep them off the grass for a day or two nice spring greens and kale lovely and what do you think of their size it's good enough for me sweet isn't it you could be deep frying that as seaweed greens and selling it for 10 pounds of portion in the restaurant i'm going to give it to your sheep come on girls these dorset greens will give my sheep some extra nutrients and minerals but won't stop my lawn from being devoured in a week's time there'll be nothing left here so i think you've got to find some other grass so i think you have to get on the phone to some of your friends and see if someone else has got a nice bit of garden who are you the regulars at your restaurant who've got big gardens in london david victoria i'm sure they'd love to have your sheep to stay wouldn't they yeah uh well i'm gonna ask them yeah but well get

Gordon Ramsay's Ultimate Fit Food/Healthy, Lean and Fit...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.927159, when you're cooking for a special occasion you want to nail some key things one your recipes need to be bulletproof you don't want a disaster on the big day two as well as tasting phenomenal they have to be easy to serve so you can relax and enjoy yourself three when you're out to impress food needs to look great too my first recipe fits the bill perfectly stuffed lamb with spinach and pine nuts stuffed meats are perfect for special occasions they look impressive taste amazing but more importantly they are so simple to do pan on for the stuffing it's a saddle of lamb basically a sort of rolls-royce cut perfectly shaped and it suits stuffing to an absolute tea for the stuffing finely chop an onion garlic nice thin slices oil in onions and garlic in just salt and pepper make sure the stuffing is beautifully seasoned so it helps to season the inside of the lamb now we've got the color on those onions we're gonna throw in some pine nuts and that helps to give a bit of a texture here's where it starts getting really exciting spinach in and just lay the spinach over the pinenuts it looks like a lot of spinach that's gonna condense and disappear almost instantly there's so much more flavor in spinach when you saute it as opposed to steaming it or boiling it gas off look at that now to bring that together no eggs no breadcrumbs crumpled feta over the spinach feta cheese adds a beautifully salty sharp and creamy flavor what this does it brings our stuffing together now open up the lamb keep those little fillets to the side that's the channel that we want to stuff so i want to just open that up a little bit there salt and pepper lightly and before we put our stuffing in we're going to season it with sour sumac is a wonderful lemony spice that goes brilliantly with lamb and you can get it in most big supermarkets and it sort of cuts through that thick rich sweetness of the lamb open up that lamb there take a spoon if you're preparing this for the day ahead then let the stuffing cool down it's inevitable when you start rolling it and tying it something's gonna squeeze out so load up the ends take these beauties these little fillets and just support that stuffing and sort of increase that beautiful tunnel and then from there over there and bring that towards you and then roll like i said some of the stuff is going to come out now to tie it first off around the side and don't worry about some flash butcher's knot just tie it one in the middle you can get butcher string from your local butcher or at cookware shops i got two ties go too thai it just forces all that stuffing out of the lamb when it's in the oven nice now we just season the top of it roll the joint to make sure all the skin gets seasoned now you think normally that just goes in the oven like that that's how my mum would do it but get your tray onto the gas oil in get it really nicely colored none of your stuffing is coming out of the sides really important look at that color beautiful does kickstart the roasting process gas off into the oven cook for 45 to 55 minutes depending on how pink you want your lamb lift the lamb out of the fat to rest resting it raised up in the tin will stop it cooking but not cool it down too quickly and means you won't lose any of those lovely juices next i'm making a simple but sophisticated accompaniment for the lamb top and tell the cucumber peel it cut the cucumber into three and just core taking out all that it's just sort of watery seedy and it spoils the flavor slice the cucumber cucumber in really nice way of making a cheap and cheerful cucumber look glamorous we're gonna dress that cucumber with a nice fresh yogurt a couple of tablespoons next some fresh mint dressing a touch of salt a touch of pepper and then pomegranate molasses that just sweetens it up finish that with lemon mix that up lamb it's rested carefully take off the string and then just gently pull them back straightened edge knife that's going to cut through that crispy fat on the outside instantly i tied it purposely so i can get my portion control from the lines hold it nice and firmly look at your line where the string was and look this one is going to be amazing lay and down just in those two slices there it proves that stuffing meats is for special occasions because that is a saddle of lamb at its absolute best stuffing meats and fish not only makes them look fantastic it also gives them an extra added flavor dimension too once you've mastered the technique you'll be able to turn out dishes that will guarantee you'll have an unforgettable feast here are three more of my favorite easy stuff dishes that are perfect for any feast first up chicken with garlic and chestnut stuffing packed with flavor and earthy richness for the stuffing fry finely chopped onion garlic and celery in hot olive oil next add pine nuts which have a lovely creamy taste and chopped earthy cooked chestnuts both add a wonderfully chewy texture and richness to stuffings season and add chopped parsley [Music] then stir in cooked wild rice next take a whole debone chicken it's fitting to do at home but if you ask your butcher will do it for you and pile the stuffing mixture along the center now simply roll the chicken up tightly and tie it with your butcher string then roast in a hot oven for just over an hour [Music] simply carve into magnificent thick slices so impressive so easy and trust me this is a dish guaranteed to get a fantastic reaction on any occasion whole stuffed fish will always make an impression my next recipe is sea bass stuffed with fennel lemon and capers first place a whole gutted sea bass on foil and season the fish inside and out sea bass is known as the king of the seas and has a wonderful sweet white flesh start the stuffing with sliced fennel its aniseed flavour works brilliantly with the fish next add capers fresh dill and slices of lemon then dot in knobs of butter lastly add a splash of white wine which helps to steam the fish and creates a lovely sauce and seal tightly into a parcel this locks in all the juices and flavor then simply bake in a medium oven unwrap and hear your guess ooh and ah with delight prepared in 10 minutes wrap for intense flavor a stunning sea bass that's bound to create a stir [Music] my next dish throws a spanish twist on a classic english roast pork stuffed with manchego and mandrillo use a pork loin roasting joint lay the joint skin side down and cut three quarters of the way into the flesh creating space for the stuffing next thinly sliced spanish manchego cheese this has a wonderful buttery nutty taste and is fantastic for stuffing as it melts brilliantly sliced spanish mimbrello quince jelly sweet and perfumed is the perfect partner for the saltiness of the cheese then simply layer your cheese and quince jelly into the pork add sage leaves for a strong and deliciously bitter flavour roll the meat up and tie with butcher string next add more sage leaves and some aromatic fresh thyme to a roasting tin then lay the pork on top skin side up cut a bob of garlic in half and wedge it under the meat the garlic wedges help lit the pork so it roasts to perfection and will add a sweet depth of flavor to your gravy drizzle with olive oil season and roast for just over an hour with the heat on high for the first 20 which helps get the skin crispy and golden once cooked leave the pork to rest as you make a stunning gravy simply place the roasting tin over a medium heat add a lug of sherry and delays using the roasting juices gives your gravy maximum flavor simmer and reduce for a few minutes then pour in the incredible resting juices from the pork finally strain the silky rich gravy over the stuffed loin and serve immediately stuff through with incredible flavor rich sweet and aromatic a stunning centerpiece fit to grace any table anywhere anytime three dishes stuffed to perfection proof you can have food that's simple to pull off but looks incredible and tastes a million bucks amazing

Gordon Ramsay's Ultimate Fit Food/Healthy, Lean and Fit...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.927159, as a chef it's always satisfying to take a classic dish give it a facelift and bring it bang up to date my new version of beef wellington retains the luxuriousness which made it brilliant in the first place but gives it a seasonal lift if you want to really spoil your friends this christmas this is the perfect special occasion dish beef wellington has to be the ultimate indulgence one of my all-time favorite main courses and it would definitely be on my last supper menu my version is a lot lighter and sexier and for christmas i'm going to give it an added twist first off the fillet of beef now look at it it's beautiful first the most important part is to sear it salt pepper the fillet is the leanest and the most expensive cut of beef it comes from underneath the lower backbone a part of the animal which has very little muscle and this is what makes it such a tender cut very very hot pan olive oil and literally roll it around the pan we're not cooking the beef we're just searing it which will really help to give another layer of flavor and beef in lovely now use the side of the pan so the beef sears down the back when you tilt it it's a secret to get it done quickly it gives that really nice roasted flavor delicious once you've got the color very carefully lift up the beef and see it on top and sear it on the bottom out and onto the plate english mustard what this does now it gives it a bit of sort of bit of heat just lightly brush the mustard over the beef so really important that you do this as the beef comes straight out of the pan as the beef starts to cool down it absorbs all that heat from the mustard horseradish is a really nice alternative as well just leave that to sit and relax as the fillet rests prepare the filling which is called a duck sale put 700 grams of chestnut mushrooms into a blender add a chopped clove of garlic season with salt and pepper and blitz [Music] christmas wouldn't be christmas without chestnuts and just crumble them in to the mushrooms the chestnut's sweet nutty flavor works brilliantly with the earthy taste of the mushrooms and because they contain more starch and less oil than other nuts they have a much softer texture that is perfect for the filling that smells amazing smells like christmas once the mixture is finely chopped cook in a hot dry pan this removes the water from the mushrooms and intensifies the flavor [Music] you can see the water coming out instantly such an essential stage really critical to the success of the wellington that you dry those mushrooms out and get rid of all that water take the mushrooms up even further some fresh thyme in there which will make it really nice and light and fragrant when all the water has been fried off remove from the pan and leave to cool then start assembling the wellington stage one wrapping the beef phillips first of all these wonderful slices are parmesan and little beautiful overlap it and set it there so the secret of overlapping the palmer ham is to make sure it contains all those juices coming out of the beef in the traditional recipe for beef wellington a thick chive and spring onion pancake is used instead of ham but the palmer ham makes the dish much lighter and its sweet salty flavor really complements the mushroom and chestnut filling a little touch of pepper no salt because the ham is naturally salty just a little twist of pepper and then from there your mushrooms and basically mushrooms go on use the back of the spoon to spread them nice and thinly half an inch from the ends rump holes no hop it every time there's meat now he comes next lay the beef on top and very carefully fold that over now we're going to lift that up and wrap the beef nice and carefully so all that mushroom and parma ham is encasing the beef all the way over push it nice and tight roll it nice and tight and go all the way over now the secret from here is to really let the clint film do the work just nip it at the ends and squeeze and what we're doing is just creating this wonderful sort of cylinder shape off and then just twist it nice and tightly and the tighter it is the more perfect the shape then place in the fridge for 15 minutes to firm up once it's set it's ready for the final wrap a little bit of tim film puff pastry beef now very carefully first roll the puff pastry over the beef until the two edges meet then trim off any excess pastry and twist the ends together to ensure the beef is completely sealed in its pastry case to set that perfectly and get it really nice and firm to make it really cylinder tight climb from over [Music] and just pull that nice and tight [Music] but the big secret behind this is that it can be done the night before and the tighter the climb film the better the shape the more even the shape the more even it cooks put it back in the fridge for five minutes to fill up again then take off the tim film always like the perfect christmas cracker to give the pastry a lovely rich golden brown color when it bakes brush it with egg yolk and then finally you don't have to do this but it's a chefy thing a little bit decoration back of the knife down and then just twist and mark the pastry when it comes out of the oven it's got that wow factor [Music] add a generous sprinkle of salt to ensure the pastry becomes lovely and crisp then bake in an oven at 200 degrees for around 35 minutes depending on how rare you like your beef once out of the oven it's crucial you let the wellington rest for at least 10 minutes this allows the meat to relax and reabsorb its delicious juices making sure it's tender and succulent nice and gently hear that pastry how crisp that is this is the bit we've been waiting for oh wow my god i'm in heaven and for me if you want a really nice change to roast turkey this has to be the ultimate for the table it smells christmassy the chestnuts the mushrooms and that nice crisp pastry on the outside look at it i'm ready to die and go to [Music] [Applause] heaven for a really special occasion i love to serve my beef wellington with gloriously creamy mashed potatoes and shavings of exquisite white truffle [Music] my first job on christmas day morning is to tackle the turkey and my favorite way to cook it is roasted with lemon parsley and garlic it's fantastically aromatic really easy to do keeps the meat succulent and tastes absolutely delicious for me without question the start of the christmas dinner is this a delicious turkey now once this is in the oven you're halfway there the secret success behind a great christmas dinner is making sure this doesn't turn out dry and is all in the preparation now we're gonna make an amazing butter and this is sort of the start of the the most important part keeping that bird incredibly moist soft butter a touch of salt and pepper a little touch of olive oil in there that stops the butter from burning next add the zest of two lemons and their juice this gives the flavored butter a wonderful citrus zing three cloves of garlic turkey's a very delicate dainty meat and that's why i want the garlic pureed so it sort of disintegrates and flavors a turkey gently without becoming too overpowering then add a generous handful of chopped parsley wow that smells incredibly light give that a good mix turkey's a very very very lean bird and it dries out so it's so important to make sure that we help it to cook perfectly butter done now prepare the turkey we'll season the bird inside the cavity salt and pepper next half two onions and pop them in as they roast they steam inside the bird giving it a lovely sweetness put in the lemon and a couple of bay leaves for their bittersweet spicy flavour [Music] we're sort of lining the inside of the turkey with these fantastic sort of flavours you can see the bird is upright and it's looking sort of like it's standing to attention now it's time to add the flavoured butter just very very carefully open up the skin go through over the back of the breast and keep the skin intact the idea is to gently loosen the skin with your fingers so the butter can be stuck underneath it now once you've loosened all the skin off the top of the thighs turn the bird round and just go through here again hand up and just release a little bit but don't completely break it because i don't want all that butter to run out right from there now take your butter put it into a ball that smells amazing lemony citrusy and just sort of flatten it and stick that in there underneath one side now once you've got it in there pull back the skin and just use that to sort of slide all the way down what you want to do now is line the top of the breast with all that butter there that butter is going to keep the turkey breast really seriously moist turn the bird round and finish covering the breasts with the butter turkeys originally came from north america and they are best young and plump my favorite breed for christmas is either north of black or norfolk bronze both of which have a wonderful gamey taste take the rest of the butter and carefully massage over the breast legs and wings you can do all this the night before and simply cover the turkey with tim fall and keep it in the fridge ready to be cooked on christmas day into the tray a little touch of olive oil now olive oil on top again that protects it gets that skin really nice and crispy and it stops the butter from burning now in the oven at 220 for 10 minutes to get really nice and brown quickly in she goes beautiful [Music] that smells fantastic after 10 minutes take the turkey out of the oven and baste then cover the breasts with smoked streaky bacon what i want to do is add a little bit more flavor i'm already starting to think about my gravy so the bacon protects it stops it from drying out but it's going to start to really give my gravy a wonderful base turn down the oven to 180 degrees this five kilogram bird will feed eight people comfortably it needs roasting for two and a half hours or half an hour per kilo basting every so often [Music] back in and now she's on the way look at that beautiful it's as pretty as the christmas tree right that smells fantastic wow look at that beautiful that is 90 of your work done there to test the turkey is cooked stick a knife into the bottom of the thigh and if the juices run clear it's done the secret now is to let the turkey rest uncovered for two and a half hours as the meat relaxes it reabsorbs its juices making it succulent and tender plus it'll be easier to carve it might seem like a long time to let it rest but remember the turkey doesn't need to be piping hot because i'm serving it with hot gravy that looks like a million dollars let that rest because the flavor will be 10 times more exciting once it's rested you

Gordon Ramsay's Ultimate Fit Food/Healthy, Lean and Fit – http://po.st/REpVfP...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.927159, be organized and get prepared in restaurant kitchens we call this mison place getting vegetables chopped stocks made and sauce is ready it's the religion by which all good chefs live i don't want to spend christmas in the kitchen ignoring my family and friends when we're all finally together so i'm prepared with dishes that i can cook in advance that will last over christmas adding a glazed ham to your holiday menu is a great way to get ahead it's delicious versatile and the ultimate dish to have in the fridge for any hungry guests who drop by christmas would not be the same without a beautiful delicious honey glazed ham across that long christmas period this can get you out of jail quite easily ham salads ham sandwiches ham egg and chips this is a gammon what we could do now is cook it so it becomes a ham into a pan first things first the water cover it completely so the whole gammon cooks evenly the important part now is adding flavor in there carrots in the leeks the more veg in there now the more fragrant the broth becomes once the ham is cooked that stock is extraordinary the base to a fantastic soup onion not finely chopped and in homemade ham stock is packed with flavor so it's great for making soups sauces stews and risottos plus it can be frozen so it's there when you need it pan down [Music] peppercorns lightly crush then to give it a christmas flavor i'm adding crushed coriander seeds two cinnamon sticks and four aromatic bay leaves up to the boil and then turn it down let it simmer and then skim it cooking a ham isn't hard but it does take time this two kilo joint takes two and a half hours to simmer before it's glazed and baked however it is worth it because it tastes absolutely delicious so the glaze very very simple demerara sugar madeira that sweetens the glaze basically a fortified wine a couple of tablespoons in and then shave vinegar again couple tablespoons honey in nice bring that out to the boil the longer you leave it on the stove the darker it becomes you want your ham really nice and dark then cook out the glaze for 3-4 minutes that i'm happy with [Music] lovely [Music] right the gammon's cooked now onto the plate carefully snip the string nice and gently peel back get rid of the skin then criss-cross it don't push too deep let the knife do the work stud it with some clothes look at it almost looks like an albino pineapple the glaze and just carefully cover start in the middle and let it work round oh god gently gently gently gently it's not even roasted yet and it looks amazing beautiful look at that half the glaze over now into the oven 15 minutes [Music] it started to colour get the rest of the glaze and pour that over look at it wow the more effort passion and love you show the ham now the results are tenfold look at it every five minutes out of the oven and glaze again back into the oven now at 190 degrees we're gonna baste and roast for 35 minutes delicious next i'm going to make a pear and saffron chutney this is a fruity relish that works brilliantly with a sweet aromatic ham first things first slice the onion fry the chopped onion in olive oil without coloring it the important part about this stage is the fact that we're gonna layer the chutney with textures from onion to apple to pear and a nice little block of ginger grating the ginger so the ginger sort of disappears with the onions then add the spices a good grating of nutmeg followed by a teaspoon of cinnamon and a teaspoon of cayenne pepper to give it a kick delicious i recently spent a lot of time in india where chutneys originated and discovered that whereas british style chutneys tend to be cooked and are usually quite sweet indian ones are normally fresh spicier and quite sour next tamara sugar [Music] once that sugar's dissolved the white wine vinegar all in that's going to give us really nice sort of sweet and sour flavor from there our fruit these are williams pears pear is the star of the chutney so keep it quite rustic next add chopped cooking apples their tartness gives a lovely contrast of the sweetness of the pears to give it great texture a handful of sultanas pinch of saffron this gives it a really nice depth a rich golden color saffron is the world's most expensive spice it's made from the dried stigmas of the saffron crocus flower and as a general rule of thumb the deeper the colour of the threads the better the quality and to make it lighter the zest and juice of two oranges the orange and the saffron go brilliantly well together just squeeze that in there this chutney is brilliant with ham fantastic in salads but equally as delicious with fish whether it's a roasted cod a grilled fillet of mackerel it goes brilliantly well bring that up to the ball cook that out for 15 minutes now tomatoes going at the end and that brings a certain amount of freshness to the chutney really helps to give it that nice texture [Music] mix that in and literally cook it out for 30 seconds [Music] what's great about this chutney is that as it matures its flavor gets better and better and it will keep for up to six months fill up the jar and that is going to deliver amazing flavor across christmas and look my goodness me that is fit for a king [Music] another chef's secret for the ultimate christmas is keep your menu balanced in the restaurant we work incredibly hard to get the perfect balance of flavors textures and richness in every meal and the same is true for getting it right at home so over christmas when you indulge in a lot of rich food it's crucial you have some light dishes up your sleeve to really balance it out sellers are the perfect antidote to overextended bellies at christmas but they don't have to be virtuous affairs you can save that one for your new year's resolution i'm going to show you my secret returning salad nicoise into a dish dramatic and delicious enough to merit a place in any christmas celebration sam's a real big hit in our household over christmas it's delicious so versatile and tastes absolutely amazing now we're going to do a delicious salmon nicoise which is a really nice way of reinvigorating your taste buds across christmas first of all we're going to poach this in a really nice fragrant court bouillon caught bouillon is just a fancy name for poaching liquor first add fennel with its lovely aniseed flavour to water then put in chopped celery onions and salt next pour in some white wine to give it some body add a splash of tarragon vinegar to give it bite that wakes up everything that really makes it sort of slightly acidic but more importantly it goes brilliantly well with the salmon to add flavor pop in a couple of star anise and crushed white peppercorns for freshness and zing put in a handful of parsley a couple of bay leaves and a sliced lemon then bring the liquid up to the boil and slip in the salmon no need to season it because the water called boulogne is all seasoned beautifully slip that in nice and gently skin side down salmon's sweet delicate and incredibly flavoursome now it's going to go even higher in terms of flavor simmer the salmon for four to five minutes then turn it off and let it cool down in the liquid salmon poached the next job is making the light tarragon mayonnaise tarragon mayonnaise with the difference first of all hand make it to start off with one egg yolk a little bit of heat in there teaspoon of mustard a little splash of tarragon vinegar in whisk that first nice big balloon whisk and then when the bowl starts moving get your cloth open it up just go round and keep that on there that's not going anywhere now yeah what we've got to do first is whisk nice and thick so we can take the oil whisk with one hand sunflower oil in the other thumb over the end of the bottle tip it upside down slowly drip it feed the oil in whisk whisk whisk drip drip drip and stop whisk and change hands that way nothing's getting tired whisk whisk whisk drizzle the sunflower all in stop once you've got that nice base you can add the oil quicker it's so easy delicious when it's reached a luscious thick consistency add a squeeze of lemon juice and that's your basic mayonnaise done but i'm going to thin it down with water because i want it much much lighter almost like a vinaigrette which is perfect for the salmon nicoise it's all nice and creamy now add chopped tarragon the aniseed taste works really well with the eggs and lemon zest to liven it up and now the seasoning always at the end salt pepper i just mix that round look beautiful it's got the texture of a custard almost like a lemon curd it's incredibly rich and it just falls off the spoon it's traditional to use boiled eggs in salad nicoise but i'm going to do mine differently i'm going to cuddle the eggs first put some water onto heat then coat espresso cups or similar oven proof containers with butter next season each cup with pepper and lime with a couple of basil leaves which gives the eggs a lovely herby note [Music] we're going to season it with a classic nicoise garnish anchovies just roll that round like a little ring and sit that at the bottom of the basil then crack in your eggs every little component going on that plate makes a big difference taking it up to that little extra special level place the espresso cups in a bath of boiling water and bake in the oven for about eight minutes so the yolks are still soft and creamy with the eggs in the oven it's time to bring the final components of the nicoise together to add color and freshness to the salad marinade cherry tomatoes and olive oil with shredded basil and lemon zest the lemon goes brilliantly with the salmon the salmon's fragrant just take those tomatoes even further because this is a salad for winter i want some of my ingredients to be hot after parboiling potatoes and green beans i soated them together you just give them a little toss [Music] what do you think of salad nicolas you think of a beautiful summer salad the exciting way of doing it now at christmas is having a really nice hot meal when all the ingredients are prepared it's time to bring the dish together and dress the serving plate the secret dressing is starting from the center and working your way out first of all crispy salad leaves just in the center of your plate what we're doing now is building a base i don't want a flat salad i want a salad with energy excitement and more importantly i want something that looks visually stunning slice the baby gem lettuce hearts into wedges and lightly roll them in the tarragon mayonnaise and this is really important because in 10 minutes time this salad will still stay nice and crisp buoyant exciting and more importantly packed full of flavor next i sauteed potatoes around the outside i want the color now i want the visual of impact then i'm going to sort of interlink the green beans next add the marinated smarters and some black olives now for the exciting part removing the eggs from the espresso cup that little basil leaf is the crucial secret because that's like a little blanket that slides it out fingers crossed out bang and i want that yolk still nice and creamy inside the saltiness from the anchovy it's almost pureed at the bottom of that egg and that nice fragrant sweet basil almost like they've been rolled in perfume delicious and finally the salmon and just peel off that skin wow the silver slipper carefully flake the salmon and then drape it on the salad fillet amazing salmon over you see the pinkness incredibly aromatic and more importantly every sliver of that salmon it tastes amazing and that is a perfect salmon nicoise for christmas [Music] so you

If...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.927159, one of the key elements in lifting a dish from the ordinary to extraordinary is texture get the texture right and you take food to that next level of indulgence [Music] my aim when i'm cooking at home during the christmas holidays is to make dishes with the minimum fuss that still deliver the wow factor my next recipe for panna cotta takes all the right boxes it's easy to make and has a silky smooth texture that makes it one of the world's sexiest desserts first add 250 milliliters of cream to a pan then pour in 50 mils of milk and add 50 grams of caster sugar get the sugar in early because it stops the milk and cream from boiling over give that a little stir bring that out to the bowl panna cotta which means cooked cream in italian can be flavoured with anything from vanilla to coffee to chocolate i'm giving mine a grown-up kick with a splash of rum in once the cream has come to the boil take it off the heat and add a couple of leaves of gelatin that have been soaked in cold water and squeezed dry then whisk them in the gelatine sets the cook cream so we want that really nice sort of blemonge texture rich silky and incredibly smooth once the gelatine has dissolved pour the panna cotta straight into serving glasses traditionally it's set in moulds then turned out onto a plate but i'm keeping mine simple leave a little space on top for the glaze now set them into the fridge [Music] beautiful next the pomegranate glaze add some caster sugar to the pan and pour in pomegranate juice then simply bring it to the boil and reduce it down to the consistency of a sticky syrup [Music] in iran where pomegranates originated they used this sweet sticky syrup to flavour chicken and game birds a beautiful rich sticky glaze pour that into a jar leave that to cool down take the panna cotta from the fridge they set beautifully and they're not too firm just slightly bouncy a little bit springy on top carefully pour the cooled pomegranate glaze over just roll them around a little bit just to fill those edges finally take a bar of chocolate that's been chilled in the freezer so it's easier to use and scrape off thin shards almost like sort of chocolate gold leaf and sprinkle it on top [Music] when your friends or neighbours pop round for tea at christmas it's great if your biscuit tin is well stocked having a homemade shortbread on hand is an ideal way to revitalize spanish guests it's delicious on its own or can be quickly dressed up if they demand something fancier first slice open the vanilla pod and scrape out the seeds now the flavor in those seeds is mind-blowing look at it beautiful now two whole eggs in two give that a whisk [Music] next add 125 grams of unsalted butter to the mixer once the butter's soft add 90 grams of caster sugar and cream them together until they're lovely and smooth gradually pour in the beaten eggs and vanilla seeds add a pinch of salt and beat thoroughly until the mixture becomes paler [Music] then put in 250 grams of plain flour and mix until it forms a dough should just be nice and firm slightly soft and not too wet perfect be careful because you're holding your hands for too long it starts to melt flour your hands on the board and shape the dough into a circle it's got a really nice soft sensual sexy feel really nice and creamy now roll it out to the thickness of one centimeter cut out a large circle then put it onto a baking tray lined with parchment and decorate [Music] half again just like my grandma's tonight thumb in and in chill the shortbread for an hour to help it set then bake it in a medium oven for 20 minutes until it turns a pale golden color just sprinkle a little bit of sugar really nice to do when it's just come out so it's sort of it melts into the shortbread nice and generous and that's perfect for a cup of tea mid-afternoon as well as filling your biscuit tin over christmas this shortbread can easily be transformed into a great festive dessert [Music] using a hot spoon scoop out lozenges of creme fraiche and sit on top then grate over the zest of a clementine and finish with clementine halves the tartness of the creme fresh works with the sweetness of the clementine another thing i always do the day before christmas is knock up a batch of mint chocolate truffles their child's plate to make and have a wonderful fresh mint flavor the perfect after dinner chocolates right megan jack i need some help yeah chocolate mint truffles first things first yeah what we should do is get this block of dark chocolate and just break it up into small pieces okay make this for you jack that's for you mate where did you get that time from not a tie but very smart right mint chocolate truffles the cigarette here is getting that mint flavor into the chocolate so look best thing to do get a little bunch of mint and just lightly bruise it you can flavour the truffles with whatever takes your fancy from fresh chili which gives it a surprisingly delicious kick to orange zest to a splash of brandy right double cream and single cream in [Music] the cream makes the truffles wonderfully soft luscious and rich next add a generous pour of honey which helps to sweeten the dark chocolate now bring that out to the boil now the secret is we pour that on top of the chocolate okay so we literally got two minutes to get this done quick that's why i need some help in half dad yes can you beat this up with a rolling pin it's a very good idea oh would it be too small no it's a very good idea because what we can't afford to do is for the cream to reduce if the cream reduces then the consistency of the truffle becomes too hard but it's a very good idea jack you know that now gently with that i've got your boyfriend a present yeah just ask it all right just ask him what's he buying there them what your big sister's got more than one boyfriend i haven't got one giant slop oh go got my girlfriend jack what's her name emma what you bought emma for christmas don't tell seriously dad yeah a tablet too daddy's restaurant next add 130 grams of softened butter to give the troubles a glorious richness and sheen break up into small little bits yeah nice good once the cream of milk have come to the boil yeah really nice i can really smell the mint strain over the broken chocolate that smells delicious push that mint flavor through there so it really does come out yeah so it really does come out give that a nice stir oh look i can see the chocolate at the bottom see how the chocolate is dissolving and that honey has given it a really nice glaze sweetness as well because it's bitter chocolate that's right dark chocolate and then the butter starts to give the chocolate a really nice shine so then what will actually happen it happened that look at that beautiful right that will let the spoon put your tongue out right then pour the chocolate into a container and chill in the fridge for about an hour to firm up jack i don't want any fingers in there you can see let it go nice and firm as the truffle mixture sets prepare the coating so have one for the adults and cocoa powder yeah and one with flakes you know there's a surprise surprise so wait put your hands down put your hands down so look you just go like that and twist the flake onto the plate you can coat the truffles on anything you like finely chopped pistachios or almonds work really well with the mint or to give them a bit of crunch plain brown sugar [Music] once the truffle mixture is set it's time to roll out the chocolates mega two oh dear right okay i'm gonna show you one first yeah so hands really nice and cold now the secret is in there wow that's really going hard manipulate it first like that and then look roll and then quickly bang look nothing on my hands shake off excess and then just on beautiful now in there and let's go come on jack dear hello when you're ready we've been using by the time we get one done [Music] try and drop it on there rather than place it on there mate okay the nice thing about making them by hand they're not all the exact same size yeah handmade chocolate mint truffles jack the secret is a truffle it's a one bite wonder not a golf ball how'd you hurry up because the ganache starts melting we're in trouble i thought you said there wasn't going to be any chocolate on your hat that's because you're slow show me your hands all right let me help you here yeah not so big around like that like that yep and then like that in straight in daddy [Music] try and put yours in cocoa bear this time look put it in closer [Music] hi jack what i've said quick um and whilst he's gone let's turn these into proper little truffle shells cut them down when the truffles are coated and the kids are cleaned up decorate them with sprigs of mint so look slicing chris yes christmas here that's right would you like to try one oh yes please okay which one should we go for fake or coco flake [Music] really taste the mint you can really taste them in candy then price the travels away from the kids and pop in the fridge ready for christmas day another job done [Music] every year when i was growing up my mum made a traditional christmas pudding now i'm getting her back in the kitchen to help me cook my updated version a modern light steam pudding with whisky cream it's super simple to make and deliciously delicate to eat and it can be flombated at the table so you don't miss out on all that drama all right mum welcome to a proper kitchen now today we're not going to burn anything we're going to make a really nice fragrance steamed yeah sponge pudding why are you looking for christmas yeah sponge well i mean we never get to eat christmas pudding because always a little bit too full so i want to make something a little bit lighter people like to stick to tradition and christmas coming would you mind if i just try something a little bit different first mum grates the zest of an orange into a lightly buttered pudding basin whilst i get on with a sponge mix add 210 grams of butter and 210 grams of light brown sugar to the mixer and beets do you think your weight is good trust me mum i know it's my kitchen but there's only one way and that is my way that would be cheeky now is that enough chef um did you use all the orange i don't like waste so sorry then pour a few tablespoons of maple syrup into the pudding basin and put in three bay leaves bay leaves are an extraordinary versatile herb their bittersweet spicy taste works brilliantly in everything from meat stews marinades and fish dishes to sweet custards and rice puddings to finish the sponge mix beat together four eggs and slowly add to the cream butter and sugar [Music] and again please nice and slow slowly there you go all right now the flour and baking powder sieve in 100 grams of self-raising flour and three teaspoons of baking powder then add a teaspoon of ground cloves it gives that really nice sort of and a cd richness to it there you are okay thank you you look at the measuring so you get that nice right a little pinch of salt and i'm just going to give that a nice little mix fold

Gordon Ramsay's Ultimate Fit Food/Healthy, Lean and Fit – http://po.st/REpV...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.927159, christmas morning in the ramsey household always starts with a late breakfast of deliciously creamy scrambled eggs and smoked salmon this recipe is a ramsey family tradition on christmas day smoked salmon scrambled egg and croissant it's rich sumptuous and incredibly easy to do first the croissants slice them into rounds and season them lightly with salt and pepper the secret behind a really good breakfast is in the timing all the questions on first smoked salmon on top and then the scrambled egg put the quetzals in a dry pan and toast you don't need oil because the questions have a lot of butter in them this is a great way to transform day old croissants giving them a delicious new life just start to see them toasting almost listening in the pan and that's the butter inside that smell is amazing almost smells like a sort of caramelized waffle absolutely delicious toast them all around both sides and then out next just get the smoked salmon and sort of twist it and let it fall over the question let it sit naturally on top of the toasted cressel [Applause] a little twist and over right scrambled eggs eggs into the pan never whip up the eggs beforehand you break down the egg too much what i want is really nice rich creamy scrambled egg eggs in no seasoning at this stage a nice generous knob of butter now from there onto the heat and all we're going to do now is stir stir and stir and stir [Music] now the butter's melting and it's giving a really nice creamy texture to the eggs it looks rich delicious sumptuous luxurious if you're very careful making scrambled eggs all of a sudden it looks runny and within 30 seconds it's cooked working it all the time right after stirring i place this scraper in there take the pan off the heat and just work round the pan cleaning up all that scrambled egg that's sticking to the bottom and now look we're getting that really nice sort of creamy beautiful texture a little touch of butter in there now i'm going to start with the seasoning 30 seconds on the end salt pepper back on to the stove and a tablespoon of cream the cream actually stops the scrambled egg from overcooking cream in and then fold that in there now keep that off the heat but look at it look at that color beautiful and then finally some fresh chives [Music] that is a ramsay classic smoked salmon toasted crescent and a delicious scrambled egg the best start to christmas day anyone could wish for christmas is a really expensive time but with a little understanding of finesse you can use up every edible part of your christmas shopping just like we do in my restaurant kitchens otherwise it's money down the drain [Music] soups are one of the secrets in a chef's arsenal for delivering amazing flavor whilst watching the pennies my next recipe for sumptuous pumpkin soup uses the whole pumpkin the leftover hamstock and i'm getting the kids involved toasting the pumpkin seeds as a snack nothing goes to waste in my kitchen but most importantly of all the soup tastes absolutely delicious and with the addition of sauteed wild mushrooms it's fit to serve in my three mission style restaurant right listen i need some help okay we're gonna make the most amazing pumpkin soup feel that's heavy it's very heavy but it is gonna be absolutely delicious right you can always tell okay if it's ripe [Music] what does that sound like um drums that's right and if you push your thumb in there it should be just a little bit soft right at the bottom of the root yeah right first of all i'm going to cut it in half and very carefully just cut through i'm using a french pumpkin but these versatile vegetables come in all shapes and sizes and colors at this time of year their nutty sweetness is ideal for warming soups curries and roasts wait and see what happens when we open this up wow right holly that's for you now this is where it's going to get a little bit gory okay you get your hands and you scrape the seeds out i like getting messy rub them together and just give them a little clean nice and gently good yeah nice look at that yuck what do you mean yuck come on holly that's it into the water now once the seeds are out we're going to toast them in the oven as a little snack so this is a really nice way i'm not wasting anything get your fingers right in there tilly there you go [Music] once the pumpkin seeds are out score the flesh to help it roast and absorb flavor season and add a generous amount of rosemary take the garlic rub around the outside so it perfumes the inside then add a large glug of olive oil and as the garlic grows with the rosemary its sweet almost buttery nutty taste will mellow and flavor the pumpkin all the seeds done yeah almost good after the pumpkin seeds have been cleaned dry and season them ready for the oven now they're gonna roast in the oven for about 45 to 50 minutes well done good and wait smell the house in about five minutes time tray please holly so beautiful straight in right well done uh big question have you wrapped mummy's present yet no let's go i'll give you a hand quickly got that garlic smells amazing [Music] holly tilly where's holly she's going to a party she's going to a party oh no any boys there i don't know oh you're so diplomatic right look they are now toasted hear that right have a little taste one of those nice yeah but look at this wow that looks amazing and that is your roasted pumpkin now you put the spoon down the side okay yeah scooping out all that lovely roast pumpkin we don't waste anything eat that skin all into the center roasting a pumpkin intensifies the rich sweet flavor of its flesh which is lovely for soups but also great as a filling for ravioli or making a delicious mash with butter nutmeg and salt and pepper that's the pumpkin done now what i want you to do is get these mushrooms here and just peel them lengthways okay onto the plate okay and i'll get my onion chopped olive oil in okay nice and generous with the olive oil because i want this soup to be really nice and velvety onions in [Music] and then scoop out that wonderful garlic that's been roasted on the pumpkin lovely little bit of nutmeg on top of the onions onions garlic nutmeg yeah and now the pumpkin say that and you would come in handy somewhere this little baby it's for you there you go perfect now i want you just to grate some parmesan like that for me okay just so i can start roasting off the parmesan as well so we get this really nice rich delicious pumpkin parmesan's brilliant for enriching this soup it's mellow caramel flavour and saltiness provide a lovely balance to the sweet pumpkin now what i want you to do is dip all that in there okay yeah good [Music] look at that now that huh [Music] roasted sort of cheesy rosemary garlicky yeah olive oily beautiful so far nothing's gone to waste we've used the whole pumpkin now i'm gonna add the stock my hand was cooked in it smells like cinnamon it doesn't doesn't it smells christmassy delicious that's just from cooking our ham bring that up to the boil we'll let that cook out for 10 minutes cream really important that it's boiling when the cream goes in okay you'll see the color lightening so that's going to give it a really nice rich creamy taste okay now we're going to study the mushrooms a little olive oil in there yeah get nice and hot we'll go first with the trumpet de la more there you go good girl then the pier mutong in and then finally chanterelle nice lovely i want to put a little bit of butter in there don't forget good girl a little bit better there nice i love the deep complex flavor of wild mushrooms but if you can't get them chestnut or filled mushrooms still deliver great taste mushrooms work really well with pumpkin because they have a warm earthy flavor that complements the pumpkin beautifully so mushrooms into the center yeah from there we get the parmesan and just peel nice long layers watch very carefully no just sit there on top on the parmesan helps to season the mushroom and really give off an amazing flavor okay we're going to blend the soup and what we're going to do is half fill the blender so the soup gets really nicely aerated now there's a bit of a naughty chef's trick a little knobber butter in there just in top so when it blends it gets really nice and smooth lid on onto the blender and we'll just pulse it on and off first nice wow and this is the moment we'll be waiting for just one side of the bowl so that's daddy's portion that this little bit is yours now a little taste blow gently [Music] to keep things fresh and interesting chefs have to be open to new ideas so we're always looking to innovate or update old recipes my next chef's secret for the ultimate christmas is give your classic christmas recipes a nice revamp because i work long and unsociable hours throughout the year i really look forward to catching up with friends and family during the christmas holidays it's a time to be sociable parties drinks guests dropping by and having a warming jug of aromatic mulled wine and some spiced nuts on hand really puts everyone in the christmas spirit love that sound christmas is here mulled wine is a real christmas classic but i'm going to give it a modern 21st century twist first pour red wine into a pan and gently heat now i'm gonna make a fragrant bouquet garni basically a really nice aromatic tea bag muslin cloth absolutely perfect for this if you haven't got muslin cloth a brand new j cloth is just as good now first off cardamom pods they are incredibly aromatic and more importantly gives a really nice dense spicy flavor next add a pinch of cloves close the dried flower buds and add a lovely pungent sweet flavor then drop in a couple of star anise which adds an aniseed note a cinnamon stick cinnamon sticks are made from the bark of trees native to sri lanka break one in and this gives a warm sweet spice to the wine lemongrass so this makes it slightly asian here a little bit more sort of exciting but gives a really nice light twist to the wine i'm gonna do first is just press down on the lemongrass and what that does it starts to release all that oil and flavor once it's crushed just cut it over the muslin cloth once all your spices are in fold up the muzzling cloth and tie tightly and look that is like a little miniature perfect chest pillow into the wine next add orange zest twist then cut the orange into wedges and pop those in too to sweeten the wine put in a tablespoon of demerara sugar next stem ginger gives the mulled wine a little bit of a sort of kick almost like that really nice sort of ginger beer aftertaste at the back of your throat finally a couple of tablespoons of the ginger syrup and then simply heat the wine gently for four to five minutes to infuse all the fantastic flavors but don't let it boil or the alcohol will evaporate and to go with that the most amazing spiced nuts [Music] i love nuts so i'm using brazil's almonds walnuts and hazelnuts and then finally pistachios lovely really nice festive mix as the nuts toast they start to release their natural oils then add a couple of pinches of salt and then just let them lightly toast once the nuts start to color add half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper which is made from ground chilies then sprinkle in half a teaspoon of paprika a mild spice made from dried pimentos for sweetness and depth [Music] and now you can see the nuts absorbing all that wonderful flavor delicious finally put in a sprig of rosemary give the pan a good toss to make sure all the nuts are thoroughly coated and they're done [Applause] [Music] christmas dinner wouldn't be complete without brussels sprouts but when i was a child they were boiled until horribly soft i want to keep my sprouts crisp vibrant and fresh sauteed with pancetta and chestnuts these are sprouts like you've never tasted before and brussels sprouts are delicious when they cook perfectly packed with texture and the flavour is extraordinary take off the outer leaves trim the bottom and cut in half that's a big step up from the crisscross on the bottom that my mother used to do every christmas i'm cutting them in half so when i soda them they cook evenly and look it's like little baby cabbages it's so compact then blanch them in salted boiling water for two minutes [Music] now this is the most amazing pancetta lightly cured pancetta is a type of italian bacon which is brilliant for adding a lovely rich meaty flavor to dishes i want a really nice robust flavour to go with that earthy texture of the sprout it's made from pork belly and is dry cured with salt and aromatics like juniper bay leaves nutmeg dry thyme and garlic as it hits the pan that fat on top of the pancetta melts and gives the sprouts this amazing flavor after removing the skin cut into small chunks if you can't get hold of pancetta smoked streaky bacon is a good alternative now hot pan a teaspoon of olive oil give it a like seasoning with salt and pepper as the laven start to crisp up take your sprouts out drain them [Music] sprouts in now give that a really nice little toss then chop up a handful of chestnuts now the chestnut has sweetened the flavor of the sprout really importantly you don't put the chestnuts in too early otherwise they'll go mush and then just sprinkle the chestnuts over lovely so we've managed to turn a sort of plain jane sprout into something quite delicious you've got the texture of the smoked bacon the sauteed sprout and that nice crunch and sweetness of the festive chestnut ten seconds before they come out lemon zest over now that makes the sprouts and the bacon harmonized and then just a squeeze of fresh lemon juice over the sprouts beautiful this right now is the ultimate and for me that's a really nice modern 21st century approach to cooking an old-fashioned vegetable with the sprouts done i'm ready to serve my ultimate christmas dinner making a stunning pork apricot and pistachio stuffing the day before is a great way to get ahead it's easy to do looks a million dollars and tastes absolutely delicious christmas dinner for me is not about food piled high on a plate less is more i'd rather have five or six things on a plate that tastes absolutely delicious than 10 items tasting average stuffing for instance i'd much rather put a lot more effort into the stuffing and enjoy it but eat a lot less of it first add pork mince to the bowl season with salt and pepper and mix take your grater and a bravo and apple just get the grater and grate the apple in there usually stuffing is cooked in the turkey but i'm doing mine separately so i can make in advance and get the flavor and presentation spot on now the nice thing about the apple it goes brilliantly well with the pork it makes it a little bit sweeter it also makes it a lot lighter as well which is really important next add a handful of chopped apricots which gives the stuffing another fruity note and a lovely texture the apple disintegrates but the apricots stay really nice intact nice little bite then chop a handful of pistachio nuts again i'm thinking of the buildup of textures flavor and also color pistachios in now give that a really good mix grating some lemon zest the zest is packed full of intensely flavored essential oils which gives the stuffing a vibrant citrus zing [Music] and for freshness add a handful of coarsely chopped parsley the balance of flavors is nice and delicate and it sits beautifully with a turkey now sage and pork and apple that's the perfect marriage now i'm going to think about the presentation skills tim fall a little drizzle of olive oil and then we get a really nice fragrant sage leaves the sage leaves are used to wrap the stuffing start by overlapping them it's almost like rolling a cigar but we're going to roll it in sage leaves taste is paramount but presentation is really important too so it's worth spending a few extra minutes to get this right because it will make the final dish look amazing now a little season across the top [Music] and then take your sausage meat and we want to do now is put half it onto the [Music] i plate want to run your finger along the stuffing this is where it takes on a completely different flavor again i need some spice in there i want a little bit of heat in the stuffing so it's exciting to eat murgays murgays are traditional north african sausages made from beef or lamb and all we're going to do now is take the sausage and lay that in the middle they're flavoured with harissa a fiery chili paste which gives them their heat and distinctive color it really does give that nice sort of wake up call inside the stuffing if you can't get hold of merguez other spicy sausages like srizzo would work well too take the rest of the stuffing and we'll sit that on top so in cases that merge [Music] once you've got it like that lift up the tin foil very carefully and roll that over let the temple do the work roll it nice and tight there fingers underneath [Music] just pull that back and double check lovely look at it it's not even cooked yet and it looks delicious the ultimate christmas cracker fantastic that sage will cook and really perfume the sausage meat and you cut through to the center you've got a nice spicy sausage lovely in now roll it across twist at the ends and then from there up into the hands and you push it in and twist and turn and all that's doing is just making the perfect cylinder beautiful the stuffing can be made wrapped and stored in the fridge a day or two in advance that's the first part of my ultimate christmas dinner ready on christmas day simply pop it into the oven and cook at 200 degrees for 40 minutes [Music] sources are one of the important ways chefs add extra dimension and flavor to dishes you can use this trick at home my caramelized cranberry and applesauce is another recipe i always cook a day in advance it packs a wonderful punch that really lifts the subtle flavor of the turkey it's simple to make and with its deep red vibrant color looks fantastic on the plate the secret behind any good christmas is in the organization and preparation anything you can get done in advance do it apple and cranberry sauce is a prime example first things first we're gonna make a really nice caramel sugar in add 150 grams of caster sugar to a pan followed by a couple of star anise that helps to really give a nice sort of aniseed flavor to the cranberries next lightly crushed four cardamom pods this has a lovely warm spicy sweet flavor then wait for the sugar to melt and form a caramel really important at the conference now to colour that caramel so it gets really nice and dark before putting the cranberries in [Music] wow the smell of that caramel is amazing now cranberries in [Music] crammies are very tired and acidic but balance with the sweetness of the caramel and apples they give the sauce a lovely dry sharp note to tell if they're fresh drop them on a hard surface the higher they bounce the fresher they are the cigarette now is sort of caramel to blister the cranberries and really start to break that down smells fantastic next core peel and thinly slice two apples and once this sauce is finished it really just helps to sort of wake up the flavor of the turkey now the cranberries are starting to break down apple in smells fantastic a touch of salt and pepper that's really important really helps to balance that tartness against the acidity of the apple salt pepper really brings it back the smell is fantastic it's a sort of sweet sour spicy nice now from there delays the pan with a touch of port around the side deglazing dissolves all the lovely sticky caramelized bits of food that are stuck to the pan and incorporates them into the sauce next add the zest of an orange and for another layer of fragrant sweetness squeezing the juice lovely then cook on a low heat for five to ten minutes to thicken but remember the sauce will become even thicker once it's cooled down now that is the right texture i don't want a runny sauce i want something really nice and thick delicious packed full of flavor perfect if you really want to get ahead this sauce can be made three or four days in advance and kept in the fridge which allows the flavors to develop even more [Music] then on christmas day simply bring it up to room temperature and serve another job done leaving you more time to enjoy this very special day [Music] you

If you...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.927159, stuffed meats are perfect for special occasions they look impressive taste amazing but more importantly they are so simple to do pan on for the stuffing it's a saddle of lamb basically a sort of rolls-royce cut perfectly shaped and it suits stuffing to an absolute tea for the stuffing finely chop an onion garlic nice thin slices oil in onions and garlic in salt and pepper make sure the stuffing is beautifully seasoned so it helps to season the inside of the lamb now we've got the color on those onions we're gonna throw in some pine nuts and that helps to give a bit of a texture here's where it starts getting really exciting spinach in and just lay the spinach over the pineapples it looks like a lot of spinach that's going to condense and disappear almost instantly there's so much more flavor in spinach when you saute it as opposed to steaming it or boiling it gas off look at that now to bring that together no eggs no breadcrumbs crumpled feta over the spinach feta cheese adds a beautifully salty sharp and creamy flavor what this does it brings our stuffing together now open up the lamb keep those little fillets to the side that's the channel that we want to stuff so i want to just open that up a little bit there salt and pepper lightly and before we put our stuffing in we're going to season it with suman sumac is a wonderful lemony spice that goes brilliantly with lamb and you can get it in most big supermarkets and it sort of cuts through that thick rich sweetness of the lamb open up that lamb there take a spoon if you're preparing this for the day ahead then let the stuffing cool down it's inevitable when you start rolling it and tying it something's gonna squeeze out so load up the ends take these beauties these little fillets and just support that stuffing and sort of increase that beautiful tunnel and then from there over there and bring that towards you and then roll like i said some of the stuff is going to come out now to tie it first off around the side and don't worry about some flash butcher's knot just tie it one in the middle you can get butcher string from your local butcher or at cookware shops i got two ties go too tight it just forces all that stuffing out of the lamb when it's in the oven nice now we just season the top of it roll the joint to make sure all the skin gets seasoned now you think normally that just goes in the oven like that that's how my mum would do it but get your tray onto the gas oil in get it really nicely colored none of your stuffing is coming out the sides really important look at that color beautiful does kickstart the roasting process gas off into the oven cook for 45 to 55 minutes depending on how pink you want your lamb lift the lamb out of the fat to rest resting it raised up in the tin will stop it cooking but not cool it down too quickly and means you won't lose any of those lovely juices next i'm making a simple but sophisticated accompaniment for the lamb top and tail the cucumber peel it cut the cucumber into three and just core taking out all that it's just sort of watery seedy and it spoils the flavor slice the cucumber cucumber in really nice way of making a cheap and cheerful cucumber look glamorous we're gonna dress that cucumber with a nice fresh yogurt couple of tablespoons next some fresh mint dressing a touch of salt a touch of pepper and then pomegranate molasses that just sweetens it up finish that with lemon mix that up lamb it's rested carefully take off the string and then just gently pull them back straight edge knife is going to cut through that crispy fat on the outside instantly i tied it purposely so i can get my portion control from the lines hold it nice and firmly look at your line where the string was and look this one is going to be amazing lay and down just in those two slices there it proves that stuffing meat is for special occasions because that is a saddle of lamb at its absolute best stuffing meat and fish not only makes them look fantastic it also gives them an extra added flavor dimension too once you've mastered the technique you'll be able to turn out dishes that will guarantee you'll have an unforgettable feast cooking's all about being bold and adventurous and this dish is exciting because it's slowly cooked and the longer it cooks the more flavoursome it becomes marinating the lamb first chilis we're going to use a mixture of red and green take off the tops and just slice in garlic crushed don't worry about chopping these ultra fine just get it in there cooking for up to three hours everything sort of blends and almost sort of purees itself together smoked paprika goes brilliantly well with the chilis two teaspoons in a touch of dried oregano some little cumin seeds the blend and the fragrance that they give out is extraordinary they release a little oil as well and helps to tenderize the lamb a touch of salt pepper cinnamon that sort of sweetens up the lamb olive oil just a tablespoon and the olive oil helps to sort of stick all those wonderful spices to the lamb jump in just start really rubbing at this stage you can leave the lamb to marinade for anything from half an hour to overnight allowing the spices to really penetrate the meat giving amazing results when you tuck in delicious vegetables carrots and onions and that's it sliced secret slicing vegetables for brazing is not getting too thin you slice the onions too thin they burn you've got that horrible char taste on that slow braised grazing it's just a chef's term that means cooking in liquid on a low heat making the meat incredibly moist and beautifully tender so the secret of braising is having a really nice thick durable pan get that nice and hot just a touch of olive oil lamb in hold the bone because you're in control then into the pan i want that white fat to start rendering so it'll add more fat therefore making it a lot more flavoursome as it braises chilies cinnamon in mix that up and don't be scared you're not burning this you're sort of searing the lamb shanks and this is the important part right at the very beginning we're getting the color on the lamb which washes off as it braises in the oven so be generous with that color vegetables in wow and then a couple of baileys so now you lift the lamb up and get the lamb sat on top of the vegetables now just glaze the pan with red wine the glazing means that you're you're cleaning the bottom of the pan and you're getting that amazing flavor washed off and lifted up into that sauce can really transform that dish always delays then bring to the boil and cook for about 10 minutes to reduce the wines reduce down by half now with the stock bring that stock back up to the ball and then into the oven now don't cover it when you cover it all the condensation comes off the lid your lamb becomes gray all this effort and that exciting spice gets washed away no lid and into the oven for three hours a slow cook on a low heat of 160 degrees gives the spices time to work and transform the meat so it's mouthwateringly tender now look at those out on to a plate you can just see that meat sliding down juicy and crazy tender grab it by the the shank roll around that rich delicious sauce look at that and get your sauce nice beautiful just get some mint don't chop it just pick that fresh mint and let it snow and there you go a very spicy delicious melting in the mouth lamb shank amazing one of the secrets to slow cooking is to be robust and really get stuck in big bold flavors work really well so don't be precious this is gutsy cooking at its absolute best these are lamb breasts a beautiful cheap cut and it's sort of tucked alongside the rib they've been boned out the skin has been taken off we're going to roll them stuff them and braise them braising simply means cooking in liquid on a low heat making the meat divinely tender now open them up and give them a really good season season them both sides inside and out really important it doesn't look like a real weighty dense cut of meat but once it's beautifully slow braised it's just like melting lamb it's incredible i'm going to season the breasts with some dried oregano put a heat in there some chili flakes [Music] lemon zest put some amazing salted anchovies in there now they almost melt inside the lamb so the balance of flavours work beautifully now pull it down towards you and roll that nice and tightly that's what i'm looking for string i just need to tie them three times one at each end and one in the middle i fell in love with this dish years ago when i first started working in paris because we had all the lamin from the pyrenees the nice thing is they can be done the day before pan on olive oil in get their oil nice and hot lamin really important to get some nice color on there whilst they're browning slice the onion the lamb's gonna be cooking for two and a half hours so don't slice the onions too thinly otherwise they'll burn garlic and leave whole got a color on them look at that beautiful take them out onions in and garlic straight in lovely that's the secret about slow braising you never change pans why all the goodness is in that one pan a few chili seeds in there oregano nice pinch a little bit of lemon in there i'm gonna do the onions what i did to the lamb [Music] next my capers fry them off get them exploding at the bottom of the pan they get nice and crispy next my black olives now white wine mmm bring that up to the boil deglazing the pan as well i rinse in the bottom of that pan and now the flavour in there is just extraordinary now where that tomatoes [Music] puncture those plum tomatoes [Music] then simply place the lamb breast back in the pot and remember to taste [Music] that's nice lid on into the oven 170 two two and a half hours and forget about it [Music] wow beautiful all that has reduced down to this amazing nice tomato sauce and the lamb has kept its color look at that it's braised beautifully very carefully get your little bits there slice off pull off the little bits of string this is why i get really excited the secret is not to slice it too thinly look at that i can smell the lemon it's hard to believe when you slice through the center there that that is a very cheap cut of meat i'm salivating i love this i mean it's just incredible pick up the tomatoes and the olives and the onions an amazing rich sauce take your lamb sort of just sit it on it looks incredible and that for me is why chefs get so excited with cheap cuts because the end results are incredible breast of lamb with lemon anchovies chili and oregano you

that if you want to go on a crash course and you want to lose weight eat sean evans hot wings because within 60 minutes the pounds are gonna drop man for days after tana kept on looking at my trousers and said what are you doing you're spending more time in the loo than you are with me it's that source it burns and burns and burns and you know what and you know what today it's kind of a crazy ride you know like last time you did the show we do 10 wings 10 saucers and it ends up in a crazy place here the good news is we're only doing five wings today so it might seem like we're taking our foot off the gas a little bit but we are not because the ramp up here is extreme over here in the middle we have the brain burner we have the eye of the scorpion we have hot ones apollo these are three extreme super hots the eye of the scorpion with trinidad scorpions apollo is just from the mad scientist brain of smoking ed curry and we fed him off in kind of a easy zone on the first two but after that it is crazy so we are putting on a show for the people today uh i had like lumps and bumps on my pallets for like days on end my chefs are saying gordon if you ever go on the hot ones again and we lose our third missionary star i honestly i'm gonna kick you up the ass so i know there's only five sources but just go easy on the old man please i will i will try i will try and if you guys were to lose the michelin star i wouldn't be able to sleep i would take that personally i would feel like it were my fault so not today gordon i'm going to take good care of you and we'll start with the classic which is this important the other one the classic with the red lady yes that one there so this is our first one it's it's just the first sauce that we use in the in the show as you remember nice and easy not too bad here to start us off yes okay um did you check out those wings your bugger they don't look like my granddad's toes these are a proper wing well you know what gordon ever since you're on the show and dogged the wings a lot of people have been complimenting us we've stepped up our game since uh since you were on the show so we're doing much better right um if you don't mind me i've got a quick tip you line your tongue with cheddar cheese cheddar cheese stops the actual tongue from burning this is amazing okay did it work it does work but this is quite fruity so not spicy but it's actually quite fruity it sort of tastes um of a lot of tomatoes a little bit of um almost like a sort of a nail but it's not super hot by the way nope just like your everyday sort of table sauce to start us off here so with the holiday season in full swing you know gatherings will probably not be as big this year but the feasts we need to keep them in mind as a brit who spent a lot of time in the states what do you see is the biggest difference between holiday priests in the uk versus the holiday feasts in the u.s i've just taken shots of um the most amazing pepto-bismol smoothies so i put some protein powder after ginger and they're like a sort of traffic light in front of me so all nice and cool and all jokes apart having been you know in the u.s over the last well just under 20 years now thanksgiving and christmas is pretty much similar i get so frustrated when that bird gets deep-fried um and the vats of oil and this thing gets wound down like medieval days and they deep fry this thing there's a reason why we only eat turkey once the year okay and come on you know there's nothing worse than the dry bird at christmas so i'm a big fan of deep frying that turkey but i like to put the butter under the breast um fragrant with some thyme lemon citrus um and then once it's cooked i like to let it rest for as long as i cook it but the garnishes the sprouts the parsnips um the only thing we don't do uh over here is that sort of pecan pie the sweet elements it's very similar all the garnishes and the roast potatoes and duck fat but honestly i always treat thanksgiving as a warm up for christmas but then i'm thinking no please do not deep fry that turkey and then what do you see is the secret to a great good roast potato when i have the when i have the sunday roast whenever i visit london that stands out to me it's a unique item yeah good question so the secret between a great roast potato is like partly sort of boiling them and then take them taking them out to sort of steam once you steam them they get fluff on the outside and then from there they literally get nice and crispy but they need to be steamed and then roasted christmas pudding overrated or underrated oh no no it's underrated honestly i mean the sad news about the christmas pudding is that you feel like taking a two-week holiday after you've taken a bite but sometimes there's a lot of rum in that thing and between you and i it's a great way to get the kids to sleep on christmas day a couple of mouthfuls um they think it's a creme anglaise with custard but i've laced it with baileys and then two minutes later they're faster sleek that's the pro tip are you ready to move on we have some very special guests joining us for this next wing yes please so this is los calientes moho and then joining us here we have shelby and jim shelby of course you remember in 2013 granted a wish where she got to meet you on the set of hell's kitchen she has since then beaten cancer gone on to culinary school and now is a trained pastry chef and then jim also showcasing his cooking skills on the bearded home cook channel let's bring in shelby and jim oh my goodness um first of all happy holidays to you both uh shelby you know seven years ago when i first met you um and understand the diagnosis what you're faced with i said to my three daughters i've just met a girl that has strength beyond belief but more importantly um has the remarkable sort of power to overcome this when i'm looking at your feed on instagram and watching the way you post and then obviously watching what you've done through culinary school and now progressing brilliantly um let me tell you something when you want to come and work for me my door is open because not only do you become a dear friend but the talents of what you're producing is incredible and you know dad as a as a father of three daughters how proud are you she's amazing absolutely amazing every day in treatment and after this kid never stops smiling she's inspired so many people uh i wake up every day blessed to be her dad it's amazing yeah shelby gorgeous how are you doing i'm doing very well thank you how are you yeah all good indeed thank you it's about 7 7 30 here oscar's gone to bed and i'm just going to go through these wings with my man and then crack on for dinner so it's been a crazy day but um shelby what's been the what was what was the the most important thing that you focused on because i knew food was important for you but what did you what did you hold on to getting through that treatment what was the the light at the end of the tunnel that kept you going um honestly just kind of doing what i love doing which is putting art into food um like everything i do on paper i just like how i made you that scratch board honestly i just put that into like baking cakes and decorating cakes and cookies as well so i just kind of put my art onto something edible yeah amazing and i love that edible art but since we last met as you know we've opened the hell's kitchen restaurant in vegas uh sean's been a few times he has his own table now he's that famous in vegas with his name on it they bring his napkin out with his initials on the table class got his initials on the hot table for the hot host um i'd like to invite you uh and a group of your girlfriends to come uh as guests uh for dinner whenever you like whenever you're ready uh yeah i promise you my darling across 2021 you you you just tell me and we'll sort it out okay okay that's amazing that is amazing thank you take them up on that they treat you very well right i'm so excited are you ready are you ready to get sweaty yeah so sean sent us some sauces but he didn't send me any wings so uh in the in the pre-show we threw it out there that if we could raise a thousand dollar increments five times i would put them in on cookies because we have lots of cookies so we're gonna do hot sauce cookies uh and right at the end as i was about to get away with two hot sauces taylor and meredith who have been huge supporters of make-a-wish here in north carolina dropped 10 grand so guess what i'm doing all five sauces on cookies so if i don't talk while you guys are doing your thing you're just going to be sweating back here according that's amazing bought a cocktail i mean [Laughter] okay our next sauce is los calientes rojo if you watch the show it's it's the halfway mark it's it's halfway down the lineup so a little bit of a kick but not too crazy not too wild i have to know how it tastes on a cookie though that might be a first it is really weird yeah but what's hot yeah oh i'm okay thank you though wow i think there's lemon in it i also brought my own i don't know if i'm supposed to wipe my backside with them or not gordon taking down the flight of antidote um so now you've just kicked up a notch that is a raw spice super hot and uh it's very uh it's rough right it's sort of um it wakes you up okay because right now in between my big toe and my pinky i've started to sweat which is never a good sign because it starts to move up shall we i'm going to stop there but not decent so gordon last time you're on the show besides all the sweating we talked about some of these more bizarre food trends like spaghetti doughnuts or black burger buns and since then tick tock has really taken over the world and you've kind of turned to discovering these bizarre food creations on that platform and uh you know shelby i'd be curious your thoughts on this as well gordon shelby jim what do you think of social media and how it affects or changes or influences how people cook at home yeah that's a good question um tick tock originally was set up to sort of bring that level of fun in dancing i got size 15 feet matilda uh our youngest daughter she's always dancing on there so she said dad you got to do this tick tock thing i said really tilly she then made me switch the light off and jump into her clothes she jumped in mine was slightly weird because it didn't go down well with the dear wife because she said what are you doing a man of your age dressing your daughter's clothes however the whole excitement around tick tock now is about having fun i think tick tock's been a breath of fresh air across the pandemic and more importantly it gives a lot of hope to having some fun especially through dark times and you know watching what make a wish have done in terms of sending videos and sort of little anecdotes there's now a brigade sean of t tick tock chefs out there they're sort of obsessed they can't cook for crap but they edit their videos down where they make themselves look good but to be honest that's the editor so it's very funny and last week a girl uh i think she was in boston took a rib right there on your eyes gordon oh yes she was in boston and she stuck two rib eye steaks inside a toaster to cook the rib eyes in a toaster i saw that come on shall we you must have seen some crazy nuts on tick tock i've actually seen that rib eye one but honestly tic toc has also shown people how to make that like whipped coffee which a lot of my friends have made that was kind of in the beginning of like the whole stay-at-home order and everything everyone was making it i was not one of those people unfortunately but i should have um no i am enjoying tick tock yet because i feel like i'm the old guy that when i like facebook everybody goes to instagram when i go to instagram everybody goes to tick tock or snap or whatever else so if you think i need to put food on tick tock just know we're going to scare away millions of youth well i haven't really been cooking on tick tock but i have recently into a new apartment and done a lot more home cooking than i used to do i used to be just straight a diet of crap service but now i'm actually in the kitchen doing my thing i i have some samples uh some pictures of some recently cooked dishes and i'm just curious what you guys think of each so this first one that's up it's kind of it's seasonal very autumn like so this is a apple butter pork tenderloin and then you have some roasted carrots beets that's little uh goat cheese milk with there with that the sauce is like applesauce cinnamon cream sort of thing that i made i have thick thick skin dude i mean there's a great color on the pork portion slightly tiny but it looks like the cat's puked on the side of the plate what is that is that a sauce it's a sauce yeah it's a little little apple apple sauce little cinnamon uh little cream sort of situation that i put together now you sort of stuck a uh a dessert on the side of the pork um promise me you won't bottle that sauce i i i promise you i promise you on shelby jim do you guys have any uh thumbs up thumbs down what do you think so apple butter is super famous here in north carolina we absolutely love it would you agree um but when you put it on a plate that light of a color it reminds me of something that comes out the wrong way um thank you it looks great yeah pretty tasty all right let's move on to the next one up next this was actually my first one like my first home-cooked meal in years it's a sherry glazed chicken with zucchini and then i think those are some uh asiago stuffed tomatoes alongside i mean what a donut first of all you don't put cherry on a freaking chicken now you keep that for your trifle your muppet secondly the zucchini looks shocking at least turn the pan on to get some color i mean of all the food chats we've had over the years you present that to me honestly it looks like the sort of leftovers from a frat party not for me all right one more hopefully i can win you over with this last one so this is actually this is actually this next one this is my first attempt at a home style fried chicken then you have some corn and then some green onion mashed potatoes alongside that okay so listen you got a great color on the chicken there so i like that um that corn looks like a leftover succotash from last thanksgiving so again come on some chili some shallots and garlic give it some love and and the mash that looks like it's just been whipped out of some bears backside [Laughter] oh goodness gracious i'm humble i'm humbled i'm humbled before having you guys we need to spend more time in the kitchen mr evans a hundred percent you know uh i'm i'm there anytime anytime but i'm i'm working my way i'm working my way you got to start somewhere i'm working on it has been a lot of fun it has been a lot of fun it's all the people out there who are who fear it or who are worried about it or like oh it's so much easier to order this sort of uh i've kind of fallen in love with the ritual of it all with sort of music and chopping stuff up and preparing the ingredients like the whole part of the experience for me is something that i've really fallen in love with good all right i haven't done enough stalling as we move on down the line up so yes brain burner is that right it gets pretty crazy here oh excuse me please man why am i burping already that is that the brain burner this is the brain burner this next one and it is pretty crazy hot it's a wild one look at what's in there jesus so so this one it's a mix of scotch bonnet peppers carolina reaper a six-figure scoville rating it is like a prank gordon i can see it in your face jimbo i can see it in your face yeah yeah yeah no that's uh that's uh that's rancid yeah that's uh that's rough man that's uh man that's like eating a mouthful of bobby flays cuisine that's gross you can still burn you still got that you still got that dragon fire gordon ramsay burn there's no flavor in the chicken wing you've just decimated any taste of chicken you don't know flamethrower but through the pain through the burn through the fire gordon ramsay i'm very curious you know um this year uh you know we have people outside the workforce but i know that the second we can get back out in the streets the thing that i'm looking forward to mostly is returning to a buzzing dining room i think yes on your world travels if you close your eyes and think of your most memorable food experience what first memory that comes to mind two secs yep um i would have to say um something like um cambodia we were there recently filming and you know vietnamese cambodian cuisine you know very little dairy you know the incredible broths the paste the make out of shrimp you know indonesia again just incredible so yeah i'd go for a vietnamese um because that level of you know humble cooking was just exceptional especially when they do it properly there so um breathtaking and then the big surprise this summer was when we went to visit um croatia croatia has sort of always played second fiddle to italy but the croatian cuisine and the truffles that we discovered in croatia and the shellfish was just exceptional so yeah croatia and vietnam jim how you feeling after that last sauce i can't feel my lips my nose is running and i'm sweating like a pig inside yeah all of us all of us that same exact way i've had that sauce many times before you never fully get used to it after that sauce we'll try to move a little bit quicker towards the finish line this next one is the eye of the scorpion as the name would imply it has a combination of trinidad scorpion peppers very very spicy brutal hot sauce it looks like the smell honestly it's so strong man chocolate chips and hot sauce there's just something wrong about this brutal absolutely brutal no no no no no no no that was disgusting capital d not good people discussing the difficult here to close it out but we're almost there we're approaching the finish line here and you're on the topic of spicy foods you know obviously as you can tell we push it to the extreme here on hot ones but it does seem like the palette for spicy foods does seem to be growing whether it's these spicy chicken sandwiches that you see on fast food spicy cocktails spicy gum but one place i don't really see it is in fine dining gordon do you have any insight as to why you don't see that same sort of spice bubble and fine dining i've had the opportunity to take on some tasting menu since the show's blown up but you don't really see spice in the same way that you see other food categories yeah the idea across the fine dining menu you donut is to entice you across the 15 courses so if we obliterate your palette with spice on course number three how the hell are you going to spend all that money on wine enjoy an amazing dinner when you can't taste anything for the next 15 courses you bloody idiot so we have a blend of spice that we build ourselves up and we make things a little bit more sort of uh you know enticing but without being too spicy right oh excuse me why do we put it in dessert yeah yeah just putting on a dessert the the cookie spicy food situation man we are on now the last chicken wing level one this is the last dab of apollo and uh full disclosure i i accidentally on the first wing did take a bite out of this one just just going from the wrong side of my paddle here so here i am bringing it all full circle excuse me i got blisters on my lips oh my god it smells like a sweet disinfectant [Laughter] good way to put it disinfectant jim going down the hatch i'm actually really happy i'm not trying these i'm leaving at all to him i'm good thanks actually the guy being dummies out here all right jim and gordon i'd be curious on your answer for this one because gordon last time you were on the show i could tell that there are certain sauces certain wings that you weren't really impressed with so here we've swapped some of the old out and put in some of the new take in your chef's palette test can you tell me which sauce here did you like the most and then what are some qualities that go into the ones that you like the least which one did you like the most first two are pretty good i'm bleeding again down below are you serious out of those five no that's not hitting my menu man is insane the last one i had to dip inside my pepto bloody smoothie in order to down and taste something um no the first one was slightly fruity i'd take that one again in a heartbeat but those last four no no no no i told you last time my nose was running faster than mo farah this time i've got a usain bolt 9.967 of each nostril no chance not for me every time he do it to me jim if i could talk i really kind of like the second one i thought that there's a lot of flavors and it just kept building and building i mean it's it's the most chunky one of them too which i think is kind of neat because you get those flavors in every bite if you will um yeah yeah that's what i got for you uh sean seriously i mean honestly uh i'm i'm sweating so bad that i'm actually wearing waterproof pants well you know when we put on a show like that for the people watching i just want to say thank you for watching please we are so close please don't please donate if you're watching to make sure that we all didn't just burn our insides yes over here i've burned more than the insides i said to you last time shame on you then you made me made scrambled egg so i'm not making any more bloody scrambled egg but um donations are rolling in michael's just put two and a half grand in very kind uh oh reaper's just putting a hundred dollars and then mark from the kick club has just donated 70 grand and we're into a hundred and ten thousand to what jim and i sweat while you sit there laughing you head off i swear to god uh i'm gonna i'm gonna wrap you in plym film and stick you on the top of caesar's palace next time i see you in vegas all right all right as long as i can as long as you can give me a table at hell's kitchen i'll take you up on that absolutely um listen sean thank you so much and i i'm i'm i'm i'm touched because seven years ago shelly when we first shelby we first met and i saw just your situation and then i think about the incredible work that make-a-wish do and now that you've become this beacon of hope and joy um you spend many many christmases uh just promise me this time next year we won't be spending it eating bloody hot wings again with the man okay take care jim thank you sir shelby a beacon of light um stay focused and uh lots of love sure i'm gonna get you back buddy i'm gonna keep i'm keeping my hair on the level i'm keeping my i'm looking out for you gordon i'm looking out for you really nice to meet you it was a lot of fun thank you mate

If...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.927159, for me the secret of a great brunch is fun and casual fuss-free cooking and everyone helping themselves this is the ultimate steak sandwich you want the rolls royce of beef it has to be fill it now season it beautifully i like to open up the top of the peppermill to increase the size of the pepper in the steak so it gives that bit of heat nice little chunks you just roll now nicely all the way around now slice the garlic in half pan nice and hot olive oil in hold the steak and just place it into the pan don't drop it at the front of the pan we're going to tilt the pan forward cook the back of the steak dual purpose now roll it back and sear underneath next my garlic and roast that garlic thyme fry that time i want to hear it we're not looking for a lot of color because you're going to dry out the fill it so just one end turn it back down and steer the other end in lift up your time place it on top of the garlic there lift up your fillet and sit there on top of your garlic butter in take a spoon tilt the pan gently lift up and baste i've got that scented garlic thyme flavour the steak is going to cook evenly because it's sat on a little a little bed in the oven for eight to ten minutes [Music] pan on for the relish you think of a steak sandwich you think of a sort of nice heated tomato relish to make the relish finely dice a red onion three finger rule one in front two behind through and chop wow next roughly chop a chilli keeping the seeds in for extra heat start off with the olive oil into a pan onions chilis [Music] generous with the olive oil i want a nice sort of rich silky relish on there take your tomatoes you can't just use red tomatoes but these yellow and red make the perfect combination now put your salt in pepper and then roast those tomatoes off take a wooden spoon and just sort of break them up once the skins blister the whole tomato just starts to release all that really nice sweet texture a little teaspoon of cherry vinegar gives that nice acidic balance the sweetness of the tomatoes turn down the gas and just let them sort of stew perfectly now a steak sandwich would not be complete unless it had the most amazing mustard mayonnaise simply add three tablespoons of mayonnaise to three teaspoons of whole grain mustard [Music] now i've got the reddish almost down to like a really nice jam now i want to make that relish a little bit more fragrant some basil slice it through sprinkle that basil in there [Music] beautiful look at this there she is my crown jewels time to take it out smell is incredible just based one more time to fill it touch is quite soft in the center so it's just coming up to mid-rare let it rest at the same time you cooked it it'll be nice and pink evenly throughout the steak to make my sandwich i'm going to char grill some sliced chipatta bread season it nicely just a little drizzle of olive oil i want to get that bread nice and crispy pan nice and hot bread in push it down smell is amazing that char sort of charcoal flavor once you've got those marks on the bread it just stops the bread from becoming soggy and look at this here it is stunning on slice it gently one beautiful slice wow it's nice and pink all the way through and the beef is so soft it's almost like slicing through butter let the knife do the work take a little bit of mayonnaise spread that the back of the spoon on both sides next lettuce take that beautiful slice of beef and then relish on top of that beef and just slice the sandwich in half beautiful now that's what i call a steak sandwich trust me serve the sublime sandwich for brunch and you'll put a smile on everyone's face [Music] the great thing about brunch is there are no rules the only thing i insist on are it's got to be fuss-free easy to cook and so delicious it puts you in a good mood for the rest of the day and for me pancakes always hit the spot here are three of my deliciously different recipes certified to liven up your mornings first up fluffy blueberry and ricotta pancakes with yogurt start by adding 125 grams of plain flour a teaspoon of baking powder a pinch of salt a tablespoon of sugar then create a wet in the center separate two eggs and add the yolks keeping the whites for later beat the yolks into the flour pouring in milk gradually to form a smooth batter [Music] next fold in 125 grams of

...",2022-12-03 22:16:02.927159, now we all know you love chicken i do but we're gonna do it's a way that daddy used to eat it in paris okay now i'm gonna hold that up okay season inside please why is it yellow because it's a corn fed chicken obviously he's corn and if you eat lots of corn turn yellow turn yellow now what are those chickpeas chickpeas yeah a little taste first yeah we're gonna make them taste even better salt pepper in there as well please now chilies when you hear that noise is that made the seeds have come out that's right take off the tops we're gonna add the chilis to the chickpeas in and then zest the lemon in there please you love your zest i love my zest you're absolutely right a little glug of olive oil come on holes don't worry about your nails now come on baby you can do it now time you peed off all those wonderful little buds see so as we stuff the chicken with the fresh thyme the chickpeas become sort of fat and juicy from all that wonderful flavor chickpea stuffing done next we're going to make the herb butter to flavor the skin now what's that tarragon what's slightly vinegary yeah yeah a little bit anna cd yep so imagine that flavour going into the chicken that's going to be delicious now nice soft butter in with the tarragon is that lovely yeah now i want you gently to put your fingers through there and just so we get that butter under there but i need those small beautiful little hands ew what's wrong it's yucky come on holes nice well done i want you to get a nice handful of butter lift your hand up and push under good now see that there yeah you push it all the way down there and you let that slide and that's how you get all that wonderful yeah butter running down and the breasts stay nice and moist and like you yeah put all those chickpeas in there nice your hands have never been so dirty have they no here we go good and push down come on okay now place my lemon in there right take your garlic shall wash my hands no not yet we lay the garlic onto the tray now onto the garlic salt pepper make your skin nice and crispy and then i'm just going to drizzle some olive oil that will stop the butter from burning and look at that please open them door thank you there she goes beautiful good job thank you really good nice to see holly get our hands there do i i think we all agree for dessert it's an incredible but easy hazelnut meringue tower guaranteed to wow your mates start with the basic meringue separate four egg whites [Music] and whisk [Music] gradually add caster sugar [Music] until the mix forms stiff glossy peaks gently fold in ground and chopped hazelnuts a trick we use in the restaurants is to use the mix to stick baking sheets down which makes them easy to spread and stops the sheets blowing around [Music] top your meringues with more finely chopped hazelnuts and bake for 25 minutes and the trick to stop them cracking is to turn the oven off and let them cool inside for the filling melt dark chocolate in a bowl over simmering water and slightly cool whip the cream until it forms soft peaks and gently fold in three quarters of the melted chocolate until combined build your towel with alternate layers of chocolate cream and meringue [Music] finally drizzle over the remaining melted chocolate to decorate a simple yet luxurious dessert your friends will love but be warned they'll all want second helpings [Music] the chickens in the oven and the desserts sorted now for a big easy green salad so let's start off with one nice tablespoon dijon say a nice little squeeze of honey love honey good a little splash of aged balsamic and this is your favorite this one isn't it i just like the it has a nice sweetness but then it has a bitterness to it too nice next to virgin olive oil why do we have to use a whisk not just a spoon the purpose of using a whisk is so it can emulsify and more importantly you're bringing all the ingredients together taste it's so yummy that is delicious isn't it a good tip to loosen any vinaigrette and give it a lighter taste is add a spot of water now the juice of a lemon squeeze the lemon in nice now use some butter lettuce start placing the salad around the outside this one is a la la rosso okay so we'll put that one on the inside we're sort of making a nice flower and you put your heart in it's just like a there that's exactly what i'm trying to do a nice beautiful flower now from there you crisscross your avocado what does crisscrossing do instead of just exciting i'll show you now you put your spoon in there and look that's so cool got all these nice little bits i want you to sprinkle those little bits in here i'm telling you that first dinner you cook for your boyfriend it's going to be extraordinary that romantic dinner the roast chicken the beautiful salad okay yeah to the way your father taught you and how nice will that be all three of us sat down eating at the same time very nice are you gonna do that with megan all of you all of you and i'd grab the chicken okay now look at this beauty that looks amazing doesn't it right so a little bit squeeze all that garlic down see how soft and beautiful it is smells amazing the lemon that we stuffed inside the chicken roasted what we do now is just squeeze all that through look at that nice garlic puree i'll tip all my chickpeas in there from there some of your vinegar in now you crush them and because they're still nice and hot they absorb all that wonderful garlic and lemon puree the rich delicious creamy vinaigrette the chilis i can guarantee you young lady that they are the best the finest the most delicious chickpeas you've ever tasted [Music] go on then it's yummy right in now little drizzle extra virgin olive oil over them beautifully done [Music] on chickpeas and that is a roast chicken fit for a kingdom this looks really yummy this is my ultimate home-cooked french dinner first job my chicken frigge tilly would you mind helping daddy with the chicken fricassee please we're gonna start off with browning all the chicken off nicely pan on get that nice and hot what i want you to do for me first is to season the chicken with salt and pepper please thank you so that's on one side then we turn the chicken over so we season it on the other side salt good girl and pepper nice now this is almost like a chicken stew okay what's that there [Music] um time time good girl what's that one there that one's real that's right originally and because this is quite a rustic french dish we don't need to chop everything so you get the garlic and you just bash it like that now smell right so that's nice and hot put a tablespoon of olive oil in there a couple of gloves one two good girl put the chicken in and you lay away you got that nice and brown i'm getting good at this you are skin side down so we got the color on the skin now i just want you to cut the mushrooms in half the belly please okay these are chestnut mushrooms there are lots of different kinds of mushrooms out there there are lots and lots of different types of mushrooms which one's your favorite one of my favorites is the giro mushroom i like mushrooms that are a bit bigger than this and um some dinners with mum we cut out the middle put pesto and cheese in it and then we bake them ah so i want you to sprinkle the pancetta over the chicken please good girl nice mushrooms not yet because i'm gonna get some color on the chicken first okay and as that pancetta starts to cook down it puts a really nice flavor on the chicken yeah so we're sort of soaking everything okay all right garlic in please good girl just throw them in and i want you to sprinkle the mushrooms on top of that good girl and then there's the rosemary you can get your fingers like that and you pull it down you take it all off hold it put it down good girl so now you've got the nice little rosemary sprigs and we do the same with the thyme now the thyme flour is a little bit smaller what different flavors do they give so the thyme is a little bit sweeter okay and the rosemary a little bit more savoury which ones you like i like them both because they both get a nice smell don't they so bay leaf in i'd like you to put that rosemary and thyme in there please lovely sprinkle it over right i'd like you to stand back now because we're going to flambe this i do not want to get those little slippers caught on fire what are the names rampa and judy julia nice okay great ready yeah in with a brandy and then just tilt the pan gently [Music] whoa whoa how cool is that a magical like a cauldron all the cognac has been flambe so there's no raw alcohol anywhere so we've got a really nice deep rich flavor i'm going to add my chicken stock you know rampo likes that not my slipper rump for the dog ah rumple the dog well he likes chicken stock yes when he's a good boy he gets um he gets it in his um with his biscuit it's gone in like wow really quickly simmer and reduce the stock for around 10 minutes now we're gonna cook the most amazing potatoes soda potatoes are really simple to make and absolutely delicious start by slicing the potatoes into finger whipped pieces then parboil them for five to six minutes when you cook something like rosemary or thyme or basil does it slowly let off the flavor into the bottle very much so in a hot pan add a tablespoon of goose fat and saute the potatoes until they turn golden and add in shallots garlic rosemary and thyme that goes in over top that goose fat now is starting to fry the potatoes you just leave that sat there to complete my ultimate french dinner my version of a classic a glorious lavender creme caramel for dessert the first job is the lavender sugar you can buy this ready-made or simply add dried edible sprigs of lavender to caster sugar and store you can also try this trick with vanilla pods and cinnamon to bring new subtle flavors to sweets and bacon [Music] for the creme caramel melt plain caster sugar until it turns dark golden pour into ramekins sprinkle with lavender flowers and cool now to make a simple custard gently heat whole milk in a pan until steaming meanwhile whisk together egg vanilla seeds and lavender sugar until golden and fluffy then gradually pour the hot milk into the mix whisking continuously until the custard is smooth and creamy to set cook in a water bath or bamboo a good tip is to line a roasting tin with a cloth to stop the ramekins jiggling around pour your custard boiling water around the ramekins until halfway up the sides then cook in a preheated oven for around 30 minutes until set cool in the fridge then when you're ready to serve dip the ramekins in hot water to loosen the creme caramel [Music] ebola lavender clean caramel [Music] look at that chicken now so i'm just gonna turn the gas right down and put the lid on just like that but leave a little bit so it can net out some stuff so i can let out some steam that's right now what i'd like to do is to chop daddy some parsley crunch it up nicely tuck your fingers in and take your time [Music] now my hands have got lots of different flavors all those wonderful flavors you could almost be french sprinkle that on there good girl nice messy buckle nice now potatoes i can tell jack's gonna love this is he looks the nest doesn't it smells delicious look at that i could smell that even before you took the lid off let's kill my darling good job by the way thank you i can't wait for the others to try it i hope that i love it this is my ultimate french dinner chicken fricassee with sensational herbie sauteed potatoes and lavender creme caramel

If you liked this clip...",2022-12-03 22:16:02.927159, more exciting than breakfast and a lot more enjoyable to cook brunch is ideal for sharing first up my simple and delicious frittata eggs are great they are so versatile and once you've mastered how to cook them trust me the door then opens to a wide range of delicious options this is like a triple omelette but a lot more ingredients than a normal mesh we'll start off with some lovely smoked bacon slice the bacon bacon in no salt little touch of pepper start off on a high heat get that bacon really nice and crispy otherwise you just boil the bacon and it's got that soft unpleasant texture in the frittata turn down the gas and now start adding your veg roughly chop a red pepper and add it to the pan the peppers and the bacon take the longest so they've always got to go in first now soak them off and the peppers have been cooked now from that sort of rendered fat from the bacon and then the spring onions just bunch them up slice them i want them on an angle so they come like little green diamonds spring onions in now for the eggs cracking the eggs for that size pan seven or eight eggs i want to fill it right to the very top and more importantly when i turn this out i want it like a gato nice and thick so slice through and seal those wonderful verge [Music] i'm gonna season the eggs with some parmesan cheese be quite generous because it adds a really nice saltiness [Music] fresh ground pepper and then whisk whisk up those eggs nicely then add peas to the pan and to give the dish a wonderful aromatic freshness some fragrant chopped basil i want to chop that sort of roughly because i want to see those flecks of green going in i want it looking charming and how many times have you seen a dull omelet frittatas in my mind really helped encapsulate the magic of having savory eggs cooked beautifully but with texture now just before we add the eggs i've got this beautiful little goat's cheese and it's strong and powerful so i want to slice it into little chunks and then just have it dotted around i want to discover these little pockets of creamy goat's cheese now slowly add the eggs fill that right up and get your spoon now just let all that egg go down to the bottom bring it back up to the boil and sort of clean around the sides and then some of this delicious salty creamy goat's cheese over the top now i want it melting like a perfect slice of cheese on toast nice now from there turn the grill on for four to five minutes now just looking at that delicious take a little paring knife and just make sure it's released on the sides just take your panel tap that will hopefully release the frittata from the bottom of the pan now the board over the pan turn that gently and just shake say a little prayer and lift off beautiful now from there on there it's there look now slice through you can see how soft and creamy that is in the center and that goat's cheese is just melting almost like a little sauce inside it's so exciting but more importantly so easy to do it's got texture it's got creaminess and that for me will beat any omelette for brunch serve with a stack of hot buttered toast and a steaming pot of coffee this easy frittata turned the humble egg into the perfect dish for kicking off the weekend [Music] soft fiery and irresistible spicy pancakes one of the secrets to good cooking is learning to use your imagination when it comes to brunches you don't have to stick to the old standbys these delicious spicy pancakes are really great alternative but more importantly so easy to do start off by toasting your cumin [Music] it's a dry roast basically non-stick pan just a touch of seasoning the salt helps to dry out the cumin even more and then fresh ginger slice them nice and thinly stack it back up and then just slice nice little thin slices in there and then keep that bunched up shake the chilli removing the seeds will prevent things getting too hot now garlic nice now add olive oil to your toasted cumin seeds and then with the garlic ginger and chili lovely and it feels strange when you talk about garlic for breakfast but the time i spent in india everybody was eating something savory for breakfast it was extraordinary into your bowl and set aside next the pancake filling add olive oil to a hot pan mustard seeds in now they'll start dancing the minute they hit the pan then finely slice an onion onions in a little teaspoon of turmeric sprinkle that in and look at the color an instant change leftover potatoes just slice them the smell is incredible potatoes in now spread the potatoes across the pan while the potatoes stained i want them sort of absorbing all that really nice turmeric actually like a sponge season those potatoes and it really helps to bring out the spice beautifully [Music] they're ready turn off the gas and let them sit there and absorb all those flavors back to the pancake batter add plain flour to your cooled garlic chili ginger and cumin seeds touch salt and pepper nothing worse than the bland pancake one whole egg milk hold the jug with one hand and whisk we have a secret to get that really nice smooth paste but whisking that egg first and brings it together and then you're milking don't put all the milk in because then you're gonna get a lumpy pancake mix and if you put less milk in it really helps it not going lumpy look at that milk here and the secret for me is to have a nice thin mix now just a little teaspoon of oil that helps to bring a nice crispy edge to the mixture now just taste it that's the texture pan on the larger the pan the better it helps to create a nice thin even surface i want that mix going all the way around the pan before you put the mixture into the pan make sure you give your pancake mix a really nice stir pan it's nice and hot turn down the gas a touch of olive oil get that nice whisk with one hand pan to the mix in one and a half ladles and then roll it round so it's really nice and thin i want to see the ginger the garlic that's what i'm looking for in there now back onto the heat it only starts to remove from the bottom of the pan and lifts itself up once it's cooked these little bubbles confirm that it's just starting to lift off the pan a little shake that releases it and then just shake it to the end and toss if you haven't got the confidence tossing then use a spatula and turn it over now that's exactly what i want that nice sort of crisp edge around the side the color on the pancake is so important now roll it around and just let it slide out beautifully now for the exciting part filling them take your potatoes just sort of have a really nice imaginary line and then just very carefully roll that nice and tightly tuck it underneath there pull it back and roll useful the delicious pancakes are ready to eat but with a simple dipping sauce there'll be a real treat just mix chopped coriander with natural yogurt that's really nice cooling agent sit there on the side and that for me is a great brunch delicious spicy pancakes amazing

Gordon Ramsay's Ultimate Fit Food/Healthy, Lean and...",2022-12-03 22:16:02.927159, now we're going to make an amazing butter and this is sort of the start of the the most important part keeping that bird incredibly moist soft butter a touch of salt and pepper little touch of olive oil in there that stops the butter from burning next add the zest of two lemons and their juice this gives the flavored butter a wonderful citrus zing three cloves of garlic turkey's a very delicate dainty meat and that's why i want the garlic pureed so it sort of disintegrates and flavors a turkey gently without becoming too overpowering then add a generous handful of chopped parsley wow that smells incredibly light give that a good mix turkey's a very very very lean bird and it dries out so it's so important to make sure that we help it to cook perfectly butter done now prepare the turkey we'll season the bird inside the cavity and pepper next half two onions and pop them in as they roast they steam inside the bird giving it a lovely sweetness put in the lemon and a couple of bay leaves for their bittersweet spicy flavour [Music] we're sort of lining the inside of the turkey with these fantastic sort of flavors you can see the bird is upright and it's looking sort of like it's standing to attention now it's time to add the flavoured butter just very very carefully open up the skin go through over the back of the breast and keep the skin intact the idea is to gently loosen the skin with your fingers so the butter can be stuck underneath it now once you've loosened all the skin off the top of the thighs turn the bird round and just go through here again hand up and just release a little bit but don't completely break it because i don't want all that butter to run out right from there now take your butter put it into a bowl it smells amazing lemony citrusy and just sort of flatten it and stick that in there underneath one side now once you've got it in there pull back the skin and just use that to sort of slide all the way down what we want to do now is line the top of the breast with all that butter there that butter is going to keep the turkey breast really seriously moist turn the bird round and finish covering the breasts with the butter turkeys originally came from north america and they are best young and plump my favorite breed for christmas is either north of black or norfolk bronze both of which have a wonderful gamey taste take the rest of the butter and carefully massage over the breast legs and wings you can do all this the night before and simply cover the turkey with tim fall and keep it in the fridge ready to be cooked on christmas day into the tray a little touch of olive oil now olive oil on top again that protects it gets that skin really nice and crispy and it stops the butter from burning now in the oven at 220 for 10 minutes to get really nice and brown quickly in she goes beautiful [Music] that smells fantastic after 10 minutes take the turkey out of the oven and baste then cover the breasts with smoked streaky bacon what i want to do is add a little bit more flavor i'm already starting to think about my gravy so the bacon protects it stops it from drying out but it's going to start to really give my gravy a wonderful base turn down the oven to 180 degrees this five kilogram bird will feed eight people comfortably it needs roasting for two and a half hours or half an hour per kilo basting every so often [Music] back in and now she's on the way look at that beautiful that smells fantastic wow look at that beautiful that is 90 of your work done there to test the turkey is cooked stick a knife into the bottom of the thigh and if the juices run clear it's done the secret now is to let the turkey rest uncovered for two and a half hours as the meat relaxes it reabsorbs its juices making it succulent and tender plus it'll be easier to carve it might seem like a long time to let it rest but remember the turkey doesn't need to be piping hot because i'm serving it with hot gravy that looks like a million dollars let that rest because the flavor will be 10 times more exciting once it's rested as that turkey's resting i want to make the most amazing gravy when i say amazing i really do mean amazing drain the excess fat from the roasting tray and put it back on the heat then remove the bacon from the top of the turkey and the roasted onions from the cavity look at them my god they smell amazing finally take out the roasted lemon first of all cut up the bacon lovely bacon into the tray you know how crispy that is that's the start of our gravy the onion look at it beautiful doesn't get any better than that chop that up onion and bacon in that smells incredible when i first got the chance to cook christmas lunch for the chefs in paris they taught me one crucial thing i was only 21 at the time and they made me rest the turkey for as long as i cooked it so i cooked it for three hours and i rested it for three hours what a difference incredible next chop up the roasted lemon and add to the tray put in a couple of sprigs of rosemary to give it a lovely aromatic punch and fry then add three chopped tomatoes which helps thicken the gravy and give it a lovely fresh taste [Music] now it's time to really get the turkey flavor into the gravy snap off the wing take off all your little trimmings all these little bits here add that into your crafty these are the bits we never use everyone throws them away off there that little baby there take him off i want that bang flavor delicious try that off it smells incredible next pour in the dry cider this adds a lovely subtle apple flavor that really lifts the taste of the turkey meat as the cider starts to reduce pour in the delicious resting juices from the roasted turkey wow there you go the most amazing flavor [Music] when the liquid has reduced by half crush the vegetables and the turkey pieces with a masher to extract the maximum amount of flavor and basically what's happening now is that we're giving the gravy a little bit of body pour in the chicken stock and reduce again in now a little taste wow i mean just close your eyes and wow it oozes flavor and turkey now sieve it use the back of the ladle to push it through the sieve extracting every last drop of flavor pop in a sprig of rosemary and leave to infuse ready for the finishing touch [Music] simply add crushed walnuts to the bottom of the gravy boat and ladle in the hot gravy i'm just going to do again a little twist the potatoes we do need some goose fat no no goose fat and we're going to do a really nice lightly spiced roast potato okay little chili flake really yeah chili flake just put a little bit of heat in there for the christmas lunch yup chili flake and a little bit of turmeric i can't believe you're doing roast potatoes for chili now would you be so kind just to give them a little cuts cut their peeled potatoes into quarters and put into salted cold water in they go okay bring them up to the boil and simmer for around eight minutes drain and let them steam then season with salt and pepper on there and just a little teaspoon of chili flake no that's the sort of thing i would make for supper and a saturday night or something really chilly flakes in add a teaspoon of turmeric turmeric is a member of the ginger family it stains the potatoes a wonderful golden color and has a lovely earthy taste next drizzle in a little olive oil and shake to coat them just let them roll around yeah that smells nice beautiful could you get me the stuffing please from the fridge put in a preheated baking tray with extra olive oil and cook at 200 degrees celsius for about 40 minutes give it a little shake to make sure they don't stick and then i'll just stick the stuffing up on top yeah now that will take roughly about the same time as potatoes stuffing in potatoes done nice why are you gonna play with the kids i will do here okay see you shortly thank you bye-bye now they look and smell fantastic look at that beautiful chicken with garlic and chestnut stuffing packed with flavor and earthy richness for the stuffing fry finely chopped onion garlic and celery in hot olive oil next add pine nuts which have a lovely creamy taste and chopped earthy cooked chestnuts both add a wonderfully chewy texture and richness to stuffings season and add chopped parsley [Music] then stir in cooked wild rice [Music] next take a whole deboned chicken it's fitting to do at home but if you ask your butcher will do it for you and pile the stuffing mixture along the center now simply roll the chicken up tightly and tie it with your butcher's string [Music] then roast in a hot oven for just over an hour [Music] simply carve into magnificent thick slices so impressive so easy and trust me this is a dish guaranteed to get a fantastic reaction on any occasion turkey the one hit wonder i'm absolute amazing bird stuff onion orange garlic thyme and bailey season truffle butter this little beauty helps to take the turkey to a different division these cost 50 quid for that size yes it's expensive but boy is it worth it [Music] [Applause] don't chop the truffle too small because we want to taste and identify the truffle parsley tarragon salt touch of pepper tablespoon of olive oil and that stops the butter from burning take your piping bag and fill it separate skin from meat [Music] bag in butter massage salt pepper olive oil roast citrus breadcrumbs [Music] pancetta [Applause] onion [Applause] thyme good old chef trick and pull down and just peel it off his lovely flowers pine nuts butter [Music] [Applause] bread orange lemon [Music] [Applause] and to start browning sprinkle the orange and lemon breadcrumbs lemon juice [Applause] there we go beautiful rest tin foil keeps it nice and warm and it cool down slowly so the breasts become really nice and moist calm what you can smell of course is that amazing truffle absolutely beautiful turkey with truffle butter and citrus breadcrumbs done

with protein low in cholesterol and so it's like the rolls-royce cut it's phenomenal i'll cut it into four marinade olive oil salt pepper thyme is a very sort of dainty soft sweet herb and it goes brilliantly with the rich gaminess of the venison juniper berries the flavor is almost like a sort of rich bittersweet slightly peppery flavour garlic get the back of your knife on it get the loin place it on top olive oil season leave that to marinade and that's ready for the pan cooking the venison you've got to be a lot more delicate than you were if you're cooking a fillet of beef because it's very lean hardly any fat on there hot pan olive oil keep on rolling it around should become nice and springy and slightly bouncy and that indicates that it's slightly pink but a little bit firm in the center butter baste the venison and then just take it out of the pan and just spoon it over there leave that to sit now for the sauce we're gonna do a really nice sweet and sour pepper red and yellow pepper just stand the pepper up on its base and just cut around like we're segmenting an orange and look you've got the seeds there fit for the bin olive oil in peppers into the pan a little bit of salt and by having the skin on the peppers it doesn't allow the peppers to become too soft and overcooked it keeps them really nice and robust thyme this is where it gets really exciting white wine vinegar smells amazing but it starts to glaze the peppers i cut the tablespoons of water in there you've got this really nice sweet and sour peppery vinaigrette at the bottom peppers out carved nice thick slices and look the juice is coming out the peppers a little bit of salt just glaze the venison with some extra virgin olive oil and there look venison with sweet and sour peppers done okay

mashed potatoes on come here please tom yes yeah you you chase them that's kind of fun i thought you cooked a wreck of lamb last night i did check but this is venison i don't want to take these out if they're not ready i love your [ __ ] arrogance you know that i've never met someone so [ __ ] full of [ __ ] in all my life corny is answering you back he's not arrogant and you can answer me back we're in the [ __ ] we've got nothing to answer back about no one's [ __ ] losing an opinion every time i tell you something it's like [ __ ] bite back bite back what i do want is 50 customers served that's what i want my kitchen my [ __ ] rules uh so far you're the strong i need some [ __ ] help right now everyone wants to [ __ ] argue and [ __ ] piss around all i want is a customer that's nicely cooked let's go on there like that let's go it's olive oil let's go time to kill some giant crabs they're big they're ugly and they're coming together it's the invasion of the monster king crab king crab is the largest crustacean in the world and they're heading for britain norway has a massive problem with these huge giant king crabs they're just breeding and breeding and breeding reducing the fish stocks and causing a huge problem all the king crab that come to england are frozen so i'm now going to catch one kill one and see what it actually tastes like fresh from the sea two flights and eight hours later i landed kirk and s where i met my local crab hunter lars peter oy welcome to northern oregon thank you yeah very happy to be here never been this far up it's [ __ ] freezing here there's only one way to get around in norwegian lapland and it's not my car we're heading over the mountains and down to the frozen fjord which is where the crabs hang out unbelievable you get like a child again you know yeah that was extraordinary good to see you 50 000 crabs live under this ice and if you want to catch one we're gonna have to dive down beneath it did you ever try ice diving i've never been nice diving i've done lots of diving but it's a special kind of diving and you need the special skills but uh we will try now don't make the hole too small i want to get out easy just in case those [ __ ] things are huge will we stay completely dry hopefully yeah so i've never dived in a dry suit before that's one leg there's not any water get in there is that feel like a big [ __ ] condom at least you're very safe oh god bloody condom oh that was hard work though yeah right ice diving can be extremely dangerous as it's so easy to get disorientated in the freezing dark water i'm [ __ ] myself when you fetch a crab you should just grab one of the legs the claws are very strong so they can snap your finger and even uh yeah more so if i'm swimming over one yeah watch out for my widget yeah it's gonna be cold down there it'll be frozen i don't know what it snapped off okay [ __ ] me it's freezing oh [ __ ] my [ __ ] boots we could get hypothermia if we stay down too long so we've got to be quick but that's easier said than done i can see the crabs but i can't see the surface these freakish beasts grow up to six foot wide and have no natural predators so it's down to us to bring their invasion under control so a lot harder than i thought it would be yeah the size of the thing good sizing and look at her beautiful my balls feel like two big [ __ ] ice cubes laza showed me how to catch a giant crab now i'm going to show him a new way to eat it but first i've got to kill it okay yeah yeah then it's dead actually now it's bleeding out yep yep we cut off the legs and boil them in seawater for 15 minutes discarding the body which isn't that good to eat because the quality of the king crab is so delicious it doesn't need much more no so i'm just going to do something very very simple with the creme fresh mayonnaise and some tarragon and some lime okay i'm making the sauce by mixing equal amounts of mayonnaise and creme fraiche with some lime zest salt and pepper roughly chopped tarragon and freshly squeezed lime juice delicious nice lovely you can try to to break the main joint here and if you're lucky keep it whole the meat will come out like this lovely it's the size of a lobster tail isn't it now look at that that smells and looks amazing this is what i've been waiting for beautiful that's delicious my god i actually now think i prefer it lobster so much softer and sweeter is there any more what do i have to go back down and get another one maybe you have to go down again okay now i'm pregnant right what do you think of the venison i liked it very much the texture was fantastic it melted in your mouth really good i quite liked how crispy it was on the outside um do you get a chance to watch food programs on telly um i do a bit uh-huh but i i to be honest too many men uh there is the sort of saint denia of these worlds yes there is dania fantastic yeah but let's be honest she does seem a little less steady on her feet nowadays yes ready there is nothing wrong with that delia is passionate lots of people think delia are very controlled is passionate and she's passionate about football but if a man was passionate about football you'd be going yes that was a difference the reason why i'm sort of concerned about the dealers of this world is the fact that we've got no one else coming through no that's right no young ones coming through i knew the younger ones yeah have a quick look at this oh bless fabulous hair look at that yeah then you add a little tawny port i'm not going to explain to you why now it'll be quite clear to you in a moment move that candle will you johnny love this worth a ton thank you to me who did you support didn't you of course one small wine glass full of tawny poor that's all right then she was ahead of the time she's knowledgeable and she was she was out there yes i'm gonna search high and low to find a talented female that's good enough to fill the shoes of funny credit and then finally get her own slot on the f words i need somebody with triple a fanny factor unique discipline tenacious and some of them love beating the cup out there for this top top fanny right andy all we have to do okay is visit the website and log on get details and send me a three minute segment of their fanny credit action funny videos is that what you're actually asking people to send

time yeah yeah okay all right gordon one last place no i just thought the mate was absolutely stunning it was well cooked it was well seasoned and um i'm never gonna eat venison again because i don't think that can be surpassed it took a very long time for it to come to be honest i think that would put me off pain it tastes really nice i don't think the peppers are that sweet and sour but they taste very good okay result of the main course come over tom please yeah okay tom i think we did 50s 50 okay the dining room decided to pay for 34 out of 15 main courses that means 16 refused to pay why um mainly the meat was right the meat was dry yeah i'd like to think that i stopped all that stuff going out so i think that's a little bit harsh in terms of 16 yeah not agreeing to pay for it i listen it's not perfect but it's a comeback on the back of the starters yes yes okay so now dessert 50 out of 50. okay let's go next on the menu i take on natasha kaplinsky the recipe challenge would you prefer the bottom and janet street porter sings her teeth into prince charles caramelized sugar sugar welcome back the f word now time for the recipe challenge when i take on a celebrity and beat

kamlinsky household you get a carrot cake made for you lovely now when was the last time you made it um i've made about nine in the last two days you're joking seriously it's the first for me you know that i don't believe that no i'm serious trust me the first time you've baked a carrot first time okay in 11 years i've made a camera then you'll have beginner's luck well fingers crossed right okay so i'm going to sift my dark brown sugar first yes that makes a nice sort of smooth center so it's not too lumpy what are you doing i'm putting my flat all my dry ingredients going in first actually right two teaspoons of cinnamon you must get a lot of attention outside the newsroom yes you do get the occasional in fact i've got this one chap at the moment who seems to every time he misses the news he sends me a bouquet of flowers but i don't think he realizes that i can't actually see that he's not there yeah just sipped in my brown flower my mixed spice and bicarbonate soda fold that in to the oil the eggs and now i'm just gonna add the carrot grated the zest of an orange and the zest of a lemon it's really important to keep the carrot fairly wet that gives it really nice carrot flavor i have mixed all the dry ingredients in one bowl and all the wet ingredients in the oven um and then basically you mix both of those together add some carrots nuts raisins dates and then that's the carrot cake and now that you've invited me very politely into your yes this is a big initiation okay if i just quickly give your father a call okay hello hi it's gordon ramsay i've got natasha in

the excuse that they're too busy to cook so every week i'm gonna prove how little time you need to create a delicious healthy meal this week's six rapid response nurses on a hectic 10-hour night shift for them being fast is critical but their diet is seriously slowing them down if we could learn to cook something quick easy something healthy and nutritious energy yeah right we wouldn't be a supersonic nurse oh yeah no stopping us how long has that been around i mean it's older than fanny credit we've never used it no we don't oh my god so freeze is jam-packed yeah yeah with [ __ ] how

promise me something yeah we're gonna do this again yeah i'm gonna cook it again i'll help you to cook but i'm not staying through the whole [ __ ] night okay guys let's go as you leave lift up the piping bag right finger in and just put it on top of that little point there yeah that stops the point from burning right time for dessert for fiddler rolls with chantilly cream and chocolate sauce for fitter rolls throwback to the 80s something that we've all forgotten about how to make the perfect shoe pastry first and foremost important turn the oven on 125 mils of milk 200 ml of water in to the pan it's important that we bring it to the boil slowly butter caster sugar salt it stops it from becoming over sweet and gives a really nice sort of rustic flavor to it off the heat 150 grams of plain flour vigorously fold that flour in back onto the heat like that look beautiful just hanging off the spoon cool eggs it's really important you put the eggs in one at a time therefore you get this really nice incorporation of the white and the yolk look beautiful piping bag one nice lump and look just coming through there she is there greaseproof paper stop them from sticking to the tray down push and twist away perfect now finger into a bowl of water and just push down those little pointy bars this stops with it all from burning into the oven 18 to 20 minutes chocolate sauce we use between sort of 60 and 70 percent pure cherry the better the chocolate the better the sauce simple as that and the secret now is to melt this chocolate over a pan of simmering water that will melt within three to four minutes butter honey just look now that's beautiful smooth and just this wonderful texture there take it off the heat and that that looks perfect milk out creme chantilly basically a really nice flavored cream icing sugar vanilla and then mix it nice piping bag push in fit a roll generously fill up to see the cream bouncing back at you and just stick them together lovely icing sugar chocolate sauce into a jug buffet rolls with chocolate sauce and chantelle cream done come on guys the customers are waiting yes come on and the secret of using fresh minted of course it's a thousand times more exciting than vanilla extract and the flavor is extraordinary yes yes chef you're a possible you should always be using fresh cheese yeah good now i use that for my caster sugar afterwards there you go good all right guys start playing up two break away play it up two back up please let's go okay quickly i'll break away let's go come on fight please yes chocolate leaves right a question four four of you yes while storm french was waiting for her main course yes yeah her and the table played shag or died which one do you think won the horn dawn has definitely got the horn tom it was really cool what do you think lenny would think of that congrats right be afraid the teeth are back and the voice fast food i hate it a big mac will never pass my lips i'm a food snob there you are i've said it now i've always associated salt and sugar with dreadful common fast food until now when prince charles allegedly called for mcdonald's to be banned the press claimed that his very own dutchy originals range was even worse than mcdonald's but do people believe it so if you had a choice between a big mac and a dutchy originals organic pie which one do you think is the healthiest i think this one if i said to you you could have a big mac or a dutch european big macs never ever okay i'm far too healthy for that i would probably say the pie touch the originals yeah i'm confused and what to find out for myself what duchy food is really like i'm going to dutchy supersize me and for the next 10 days eat exclusively from prince charles organic range so let's get the sausages on the go a couple of rashes the bacon well chutney you'd like to do instead of tomato sauce oh that is so sweet so now i'm going to eat this for breakfast every day fresh tomato soup with rosemary organic parsley organic sugar what's sugar doing in soup sugar what's sugar doing in my cornish pasty fresh gravy obviously for people who don't cook [ __ ] gravy raw cane sugar caramelized sugar there's no sugar in my chicken and mushroom pie i can't eat it i can't face it i mean my body is a temple i can't stomach the thought of another nine days of duchy nosh so i'm handing the challenge over to two younger fitter identical twins to make things more interesting i'm putting lisa on the mcdonald's diet can i have a bacon egg and cheese bagel please well julie is chuffed that she gets to choose from the posh duchy range the twins will be attempting the diets for 10 days during which time they'll be closely monitored by a doctor now i ate opacity and then i discovered that there's more fat saturated fat in that pasty than there is in a big mac this does contribute around 90 percent of the guideline daily amount of saturated fat for an adult woman that's an incredibly large amount a duchy's cornish pasty contains as much saturated fat as four ginster's scotch egg bars or three rustlers microwave bbq ribs sandwiches or one and a quarter tesco's micro donna kebabs unlike me the twins managed to stick with their menus for 10 days what i want to know is how has the royal regime measured up to mcdonald's it was time to find out what effect it had had on their health well really the key thing is the cholesterol now it's the same sort of news for both of you the percentage of good cholesterol that you've got has absolutely dropped like a stone oh really so the ratio of good cholesterol to bad cholesterol is now in the range that would be potentially dangerous long-term in fact the cholesterol ratio of the twin on the duchy's diet had changed even more than her sisters if she continued eating her royal regime it could have had some unexpected side effects lost concentration loss of libido loss of to tell libido all we can say is that in this little experiment that we've done with you too it has had a profound effect on your cholesterol yeah right so i've [ __ ] up your sex life you can't remember anything you kept putting your phone in the fridge otherwise okay i see all of that in a nutshell really janet i do feel bad about it pretty shocking stuff but when i tried to talk to prince charles about it he passed it on to duchess who said duchy's originals are designed to be enjoyed as part of a balanced diet all our products use pure and natural ingredients with no artificial ingredients or flavors they clearly state the ingredients and nutritional content on the packets we are considering adding nutritional information on our website not good enough charlie i've decided to issue my very own f word asbo to prince charles for anti-social food behaviour prince charles this is what you've got to do stop adding sugar to your savory products stop making products with high levels of saturated fat and finally start giving your customers a full nutritional breakdown of all your products i took charles's asbo to his mansion on the mao but he didn't answer the door there you go charlie there's your ass bow hello what's that you've got there this is a special pie duchy pie how are you fine considering i had tweaked that stuff 10 days no i lasted one day and you know the reason why i lasted one day on the dutch original dart nothing to do with my loathing of the monarchy no nothing to do with the fact i couldn't give a toss whether i'd get a night or not unlike you honestly yes thank you i ate that food for one day and i felt unbelievably awful pretty sweet it's really sweet why is the pineapple why is that i got sugar in it i make a chicken pie i don't put sugar in it do you put a chili out pasty that was a real [ __ ] body bloke i can't believe you're capacity not very janet you know what if he doesn't do what i've asked he has both i'm gonna go back to clarendon's house and i'm gonna post his

i want you to give them a really nice season with salt and pepper on there please so beef cheeks very cheap i cut that takes sort of a long time to cook yeah but give it a bit of love let it cook in the oven it comes out like a dream a little touch of oil in the pan what you want to do is get them really nicely colored sid sid into the pan oh cool lay away you see what that is um [Music] sitting at the dock of the the beach baby and then i want the onion chunky because i'm gonna cook it for like three three and a half hours so you go down down down and then again there and there so it doesn't overcook so a really good color on the cheeks like that so how do you cook these at our restaurants if they take so long they go in the oven literally half past six seven o'clock in the morning three and a half four hours to be ready for lunch and the longer you leave them in their juices and the cooking liquor the better three nice cloves of garlic good onions in and garlic in please nice where's your baby there it is good get those onions and that garlic really nicely colored put the cheeks back in please right red wine in cool okay and the red wine is going to deglaze the pan so delays will basically sort of rinse all that flavor off the bottom of the pan yeah okay because that's going to make the most amazing sauce now you could use tomato puree but chopped canned tomatoes you'll make a much better sauce i'm going to top that with some stock so the secret braising is having little of the meat exposed and 90 of it submerged see them now yeah they're like little crocodile heads popping up out the water turn the gas off and leave the lid just off at the end there if we had to cover it completely the steam hits the top yeah the lid and all that water comes very badly solar still that's right in the oven 140 150 for about three and a half to four hours good job boom for pudding i'm making one of my absolute favorite italian desserts banacotta with that quintessentially italian flavoring espresso [Music] start by immersing two leaves of gelatine in cold water and leave to soak into a small saucepan add caster sugar cream milk sugar and a shot of good strong coffee [Music] gently bring to a simmer and remove from the hob [Music] squeeze out the soaked gelatine leaves and stir into the hot cream until completely dissolved pour your cream mixture into a jug and fill your moulds just short of the rim rinsing your molds in cold water before filling will make it easier to get your panna cotta out once it's set [Music] leave in the fridge for at least two to three hours

are packed with flavor and a little goes a long way and nobody knows that better than deli maestro antonio born in italy and start eating italian food and i love it i want to change it for nothing else that's why i'm fat he's been selling delicious cured meats in the heart of london soho for more than 35 years this is the best prosciutto they come from italy this is curing parma because it's parma ham divine people love it and it's wonderful the fat is good because you make the meat sweet this should be cut thin like this there is more flavor you can eat with melon with figs with pears with everything any sweet fruit is good it's wonderful you really enjoy when you start eating you can stop wonderful this is called prisaola it's a hair cured beef come from uh north italy voltelina is so different from pork there's no fat at all it should be no fun otherwise it tastes greasy it's good when it's very dry and you slice it thinner you just eat it like that or you can eat with a bit of rocket or you shave some parmesan on top i love it a bit of lemon if you like or olive oil it's delicious this is called felino for me is the best salami take the name for a little place near parma and other is country salami very nice it's one of my favorite because it's not too spicy just meat flavor just salt and pepper i love it i can't resist when i take some meat home i don't need nothing else especially in the evening just meet with a melon or fish or whatever a few slices of bread couple glasses of wine that's my meal you don't need nothing else you know you antonio's right incredible italian hams and salamis are fantastic in simple salads sandwiches or even eaten by themselves and you don't need much to make an impression an amazing selection of delicious meats from around the world that are great to use in the kitchen another simple meaty staple that's perfect for quick easy suppers with a difference are the exotic regional speciality sausages that have such distinctive tastes and are a million miles from the great british banger here are four of my favorites that are definitely worth your money chorizo from spain these have an incredibly deep red color are full of smoky spiced paprika and are great for stuffing stews and paellas merguez from north africa made from beef or mutton these cook super fast because of the long and thin shape and can be used in tagines or served with couscous fennel sausages from italy made from pork and packed with sweet aniseed flavoured fennel seeds these are perfect with pasta or as a topping on a pizza finally jerk sausages from jamaica full of blow your head off scotch bonnet chilis these are super spicy and great in tangy casseroles or simply sauteed with onions and garlic be adventurous with your sausages learn about the different flavors and you'll soon be using them to add extra flavor with ease so spend your money wisely and you can have amazing midweek meals that don't cost the earth my next recipe is all about great flavors and it's as cheap and easy to make as it is delicious spicy sausage rice whatever you're cooking the secret to making great food is to ensure you're locking every last ounce of flavour in that pan and this spicy sausage rice does exactly that [Music] take the spicy sausages and pierce that skin because i want all that delicious spicy sausage meat out of this casing and you get more flavor from the sausage when you take them out the casing sausage is ready turn on the gas bred onion less acidic than a big white spanish onion and a lot more flavoursome tablespoon of olive oil a tablespoon only because i want all that fat coming out the sausages to sort of really help flavor the onions onions in and the onions go in first because you can never rush cooking an onion it's really important to sort of give them five to six minutes in the pan so you can really start to caramelize them from the out of my pepper slice around wasting nothing i want to see that sort of little core those pips in the center no fine diced pepper the rice is going to be cooking for 20 minutes so i want the veg to sort of have texture after it's cooked peppers in a bit of garlic two nice cloves just slap down off with a shell garlic in now i want to turn up the gas get the pan nice and hot because the minute that sausage goes in everything cools down and you'll end up boiling the peppers and the onions and the garlic so heat up to maximum and then just make a well in the center in now start stirring quickly this is where you get so much more bang for your buck out of sausages because the skins off and the real flavor of that spicy italian sausage is gonna come through what's great about this recipe is that you can use any type of sausage to get the flavor and the heat you want i've gone for the spicy italian but it's just as good with merguez or chorizo a teaspoon paprika in give it that really nice smoky flavor rice in and we're gonna sort of basically sear the rice we call it in the kitchen blasting the rice where we sort of soaked the rice for 30 seconds and it takes on all that flavor next white wine so the wine sort of deglazes the pan and washes all that flavor from the bottom of the pan into the rice stock in bring it up to the boil turn it down and let it simmer [Music] double stop to rice turn that gas down and let it simmer for 12 to 15 minutes and just give it the occasional stir keep an eye on it now get ready to finish it slice spring onions diced sweet juicy tomatoes and roughly chop earthy flat leaf parsley springiness in tomatoes in off with the gas really important otherwise everything becomes overcooked flat leaf parsley in but look at the volume in that pan now that is an amazing way to take spicy italian sausages to a completely different level [Music] beautiful and prawn balls in aromatic broth [Music] for the pork and porn balls in a bowl add pork mince then add finely chopped prawns [Music] diced ginger and chopped chives [Music] season and roll into ping-pong size balls [Music] for the broth eat fresh stock and add styronesis oyster sauce soy sauce and sliced ginger gently simmer fry the pork and prawn balls in a pan until golden then transfer to the bubbling broth [Music] add handfuls of spinach then serve topped with finely sliced spring onions a gorgeous healthy dish that uses great value ingredients with amazing results pork and prawn balls in aromatic broth ready to eat in under 20 minutes

If you liked this clip check...",2022-12-03 22:16:02.927159, [Music] some of the best food i had in india was street food and every little food stall was cooking up something spicy something delicious a little teaspoon of oil gonna toast off a teaspoon of cumin mustard seeds a touch of salt and pepper lightly fry them off it's really important to cook off the spices it intensifies the flavor but really draws out that nice spicy deep rich flavor so onion three fingers one in front two behind nice and fine onions in now we're going to caramelize those onions mustard seeds have started to infuse cumin has that nice kick now with a little touch of butter in there get it nice and sort of rich gas up nice and high and really caramelised onions now once the onions have turned a rich golden color that's what i'm looking for that is beautiful add baby spinach keep that pan nice and hot if you don't cook it out the actual breakfast ends up watering when the spinach is cooked set aside and it's onto the spicy eggs now the breakfast really starts to come alight four nice eggs now give those eggs a little whisk a little touch of butter into the pan a little teaspoon of oil so the butter doesn't burn when the butter and oil are hot add a teaspoon of garam masala and turmeric cook that out now take your eggs into the pan almost gonna make like a really nice spicy scrambled egg turn the gas down now as the scrambled egg comes together just finish that with a little bit of butter i quite like the sort of creaminess makes it so much more delicious and then from there you get my spinach chop up and then fold in the spinach to your scrambled egg something quite exciting about eating spice for breakfast but it's served in these wonderful little thin naan breads this will work with any flatbread or wrap you fancy and then lightly toast your naan take the eggs off the heat whilst you get on with the last job add quick mint and spice yogurt dressing couple of tablespoons of fresh yogurt in there's always something to take out the heat then add chopped mint salt and turmeric mix that in now take a scrambled egg and half fill banana it smells incredible get your yogurt down on top and lift that over and for me that's what really stands out with street food in india how delicious they can make street food with a little bit of spice amazing [Music] once you try this spicy wrap i promise you scrambled eggs will never taste the same the secret to a really good madeline is it's light fluffy delicious and it's perfect with the coffee in the morning so melt the butter gently next crack three eggs that was one of the most exciting things about living in paris there was always something there in that little pastry shop that used to live above gotta incorporate the sugar and then give that a really good whisk because it's important to incorporate some air now the secret to whisking is a big beautiful balloon whisk the bigger the balloon whisk the more aeration you'll get in the mixture so best thing to do is just go from left to right and then change hands every 15 or 20 seconds so your hands never get tired and tilt the ball to your advantage as well now you can see the mixture starting to air it's almost double in size the more you whisk this the lighter it becomes so it starts to almost look like a light whipped cream gone is that dark rich egg yolk color beautiful once the eggs and sugar become pale creamy and thick sift in the self-raising flour sieve in the flour now i'm giving my madeline's a twist by adding poppy seeds for a crunch and lemon for flavor the zest of lemon in there generous on the lemon lime is wonderful orange zest again beautiful i've even made pink grapefruit madeline's with poppy seeds delicious but lemon for me is the best pour the melted butter down the side of the bowl so it cools down even more and then combine start mixing that in it's really important at this stage that we don't beat the mixture i want to keep that nice aerated texture across the madeleine mix so i'm going to use a spatula now and just gently mix my butter in now give that a good mix and they say that the longer you make them mix up in advance the higher they raise in the oven look at that it looks beautiful leave that to sit there [Music] and we'll butter and line our moulds you can make these in little miniature yorkshire pudding molds i've even seen madeline's been cooked in espresso cups so if you haven't got the traditional madeline tray yorkshire pudding trays are just as good lightly butter the inside of the tray take a tablespoon of flour and the secret now is to lie in the mould with a flour that stops any chance of the madeline sticking tap the sieve into all the little grooves and this will ensure that they'll come out instantly then all you do then is just stand up the tray and tap it two or three times and you'll see the flower roll out so there you go the baking sheet lined beautifully no excess butter and no excess flour the beauty of this recipe is that you can make it the night before and then simply bake it in the morning when you're ready to go put the mixture into a jug to make it really easy to pour into the tin give it a little stir so you've got that nice even distribution of those poppy seeds and just gently lovely film up to the top oh beautiful so much easier pouring this from a jug because you get the exact amount in in the oven 180 degrees do not open that door before 10 minutes and wait for that wonderful surprise [Music] they smell amazing now a little tap on the side of the tray and this would just all pop out beautifully that smell is unique that nice soft crisp outside with this lovely fragrant fluffy center and the secret of a great madeline as the french would swear by it is this lovely little mound on top they call it the nipple but that is the confirmation that is perfect my poppy and lemon madeleines are a sophisticated continental start to the day and take me straight back to paris the secret of a good chip butty is in the potato now these are desiree potatoes one of my first ever jobs was working in a chip shop i used to put sacks and sacks of potatoes into the rumbler which will send the potato peeler all day long today i'm gonna do something a bit healthier for my oven chips with a twist simply peel slice and blanch for three to four minutes drain season and cover well with propeca spread evenly over an oiled baking tray and place into a preheated oven for 20 minutes simple as that next up easy fish fingers this is pollock a really nice firm delicious fish got the fish in finger size batons of fish put them onto your plate and just lightly salt them you can do that literally 20 minutes 30 minutes before you start cooking the fish it firms the fish up beautifully and it allows it to become a little bit more durable especially in the pan now for the coating start by thoroughly coating the fish in seasoned flour and then just roll it to get rid of those little sharp corners because then it stops those corners almost burning in the pan in to your egg wash and really coat them wonderful and then this is dill goes brilliantly well with a fish and run the dill through my breadcrumbs that makes it more aromatic lay them onto your breadcrumbs nothing wrong with the chip butty nothing wrong with fish fingers just give it a lovely modern twist beautiful once the fish fingers are thoroughly coated they're ready to pan fry and they'll need around three minutes on each side i want the fish fingers to be nice and crispy get a really nice color on them first and then we'll flip them over and finish them with butter bring the heat up into the pan nice little knob of butter that'll work wonders with the breadcrumbs and the dill nice and carefully take them out they look and smell incredible stay nice and crispy now to assemble my chip butty starting with buttered thick crusty bread a slice of bread mop up that amazing flavor on slice in half never slice in an angle my mouth is salivating beautiful on with the ship butty there's one thing missing and it signifies that i've never forgotten the joy i've come for food but my god that makes me feel like a nine year old excuse me for a moment when you want to stuff my face [Applause] [Music] homemade fish fingers and my ultimate chip buddy so simple to make but trust me it tastes amazing

Gordon Ramsay's Ultimate Fit Food/Healthy, Lean and Fit – http://po.st/REpVfP...",2022-12-03 22:16:02.927159, my guide to buying the finest shellfish whether it's scallops prawns crabs or lobster spanking fresh shellfish never fails to make an impression and when you want the best crustaceans it pays to ask an expert 19 pound it's a bargain at 20 pounds fishmonger roger barton really knows his shellfish inside out hello he said can he go back home so i'm sorry brother you're with me he's been in the fish game at london's billings gate market for over 35 years glean some of his knowledge and you'll never be at a loss when it comes to shopping for shellfish right what we've got here are corvettes some people known as prawns and these are a picture they've got to be lovely and shiny you'll find if they're too limp the head starts coming away from the body not a good sign looks a bit like me worse for the whale chop your old garlic up get the old wok lovely bit of olive oil lovely lovely jubbly lovely lovely jubilee in they go absolutely fantastic and if you like prawns as much as me then you'll love all these different kinds here are my favorites brown shrimps might be tiny but punch well above their weight in terms of taste i love them potted in spice butter and spread on toast atlantic prawns are great value and packed with flavor fantastic as tapas or in curries small tiger prawns are also good value and great for asian salads stir fries and fish stews whereas these massive ones are so spectacular i just keep them simple marinated in garlic oil and chili char grilled and served in their shells and longustings are one of my favorites you can buy the succulent beauties whole just roast or boil and serve with garlic mayonnaise [Music] people used to eat winkles goggles they're not doing it anymore it's such a shame they should be more daring all due respect you wouldn't make love the same way for the rest of your fat life wrinkles there they are lovely they smell of the seed a little bit of pepper and salt and a dash of vinegar then that does enhance the flavor in this country we have got the finest oysters in the world i die for these the only thing you have to look for with an oyster that is tightly closed if it's open avoid be adventurous come on try it nothing ventured nothing going get the right recipe and the freshest shellfish and you'll guarantee success in the kitchen whether it's in one of my restaurants or back at home i know that as well as delicious food one of the fundamentals to making guests happy is creating a great atmosphere vietnamese style fresh prawn rolls one of the keys to cooking for crowds is creating the atmosphere and that buzz getting your guests to sort of almost get involved and dip in and dip out this is an exciting fragrant wrap that is so easy to do first off soak the noodles these are thin glass noodles basically bring the kettle up to the boil and just pour just let them steep there for a couple of minutes the noodles are for my prawn rolls as they soak i'm gonna make a spicy dipping sauce to go with them start off with sugar we're trying to create that sweet sour salty but a really nice sort of heated sauce as well rice wine vinegar that will dissolve the sugar fish sauce now that's going to give it saltiness next the chili i want the seeds left in because i want some power chilli in a little bit of garlic don't need to chop it too finely just slice it take a spring onion just top and tail them slice the slices bring it in nice and thinly so it sort of almost permeates that dipping sauce i grew up with the love of spring rolls but on the back of my visit to vietnam it sort of transformed my respect for a spring roll give that a little mix a little bit of coriander and fresh mint roll them up and chop herbs in there's no olive oil in there there's no cream there's no butter it's just a really nice light dipping sauce and wow all those senses going on now we're gonna make the filling for the wraps a really nice fresh noodle salad rinse the noodles in cold water then chop them into bite-sized lengths prawns peeled and cooked slice them up the prawns give a really nice sweetness next the vegetables i want crunch freshness texture baby gem lettuce and just shred that lettuce next spring onion the good news about these wraps is that you can make them up in advance sit them in the fridge and then take them out literally seconds before you guess arrive peel the carrot so you got really nice fresh crunchy carrot now fresh mint fresh basil and fresh coriander together it sounds a little bit bizarre but it tastes amazing don't hold back with the herbs they'll really help make the filling vibrant fresh and aromatic finally touch a lime just squeeze that fresh lime juice over there a couple of tablespoons of your dipping sauce don't put too much in there it just makes all the filling too wet just give that a really good mix that's a very quick simple salad to eat now but let's get it into a wrap now take your rice paper wrap literally 30 seconds in warm water you can get rice paper wraps from your local asian supermarket or buy them online gently lift it out the water there beautiful lay it carefully onto your board [Music] place the mixture at the bottom don't overfill it because it'll be a nightmare to roll fold them over first nice and tightly halfway then tuck in the ends make sure nothing's coming out the sides beautiful it's so light fragrant incredibly simple to do and there you go a very delicious fragrant asian wrap certainly different to the chinese spring rolls i grew up with to prep it get the head and twist keep hold of those heads make the most amazing stock and then with your thumb get underneath the shell and just peel off that beautiful little layer now with your thumb on your finger push and shake and look the whole tail comes off you don't have to peel the whole thing from there get your knife and just gently cut the surface of the prawn and what we're looking for there is that little dirt sack that's got to come out otherwise if you cook the prawn with that sack in there it's crunchy it's not very nice and it ruins that sweet flavor and there you go the most amazing prawn ready for cooking

Gordon Ramsay's Ultimate Fit Food/Healthy, Lean and Fit...",2022-12-03 22:16:02.927159, my shopping guide to buying spices [Music] when i buy my spice i only want the best and it always pays to get expert advice burger erath has been selling every spice under the sun in london's knotty hill for over 20 years so she really knows what she's talking about i love spices the smell the texture the color spices are so versatile something very very simple can be really transformed into something really delicious with thousands of aromatic ingredients on her shelves if it smells good she sells it if you buy spices buy them whole then you can try roast them grind them when you need them and then they will release the essential oils whole spices you can keep for years give them a good brushing wine bottle with your rolling pin or whatever and you see there is still aroma and you can taste it you smell it then it's fine there's four main spices one is sweet one is sour one is bitter and one is hot this is cinnamon and that is really a great example of a sweet spice when you buy a cinnamon quill like this you have to check that you have loads of different layers in here then you can either grind this or you'd break a piece off i mean this doesn't smell of anything now but if you roll it in your hand just quickly like this and then you smell it again this is just unbelievable if you have spaghetti bolognese put a pinch of cinnamon in it to bring out the flavor so monk this is one of those really special spices sour like a lemon but it has a salty aftertaste i use this anywhere from marinades to salad you haven't lived unless you tried it a great example for a bitter spice would actually be a turmeric this is actually a root it grows in the ground like ginger use it very very sparingly about that much will actually color you a curry or rice dish wonderful yellow watch your fingers you get really yellow fingers from it and then we come to the hot spices one spice that i couldn't miss and that is hungarian paprika paprika is the powdery form of a bell pepper what makes the hungarian paprika different is that they actually crowd on vineyards it's sort of between the vines it has a sweetness and it has a sharpness to it i have it in ice cream i have it on fish i have it everywhere burger spot on about the power of spices to transform dishes whether savory or sweet here's my quick guide to the spices i use most black pepper this is the spice i couldn't do without always buy a whole and grind yourself so you get the freshest flavor cardamom these pods come in green or black types and have a fantastic spicy sweet taste brilliant for everything from curries to rice dishes and puddings coriander these citrusy seeds are perfect hole in pickles or grind to use in fragrance stews and soups cumin a savory spice that's pungent and nutty it's great in marinades for delicious meat and fish then cinnamon sweetly fragrant and great with apples or in cakes and nutmeg warm and spicy it's delicious and a bechamel sauce finely saffron these sweet strands infuse a brilliant bright red color and are great in risottos and even though it's more expensive than gold a pinch goes a long long way store your spices properly and they'll last for years you keep it air tight in a tin or in a glass jar in your cupboard don't be scared of spices like an aftershave or perfume you have to select it yourself it has to fit in with your taste and with your kitchen supermarkets and good local shops sell an amazing array of different spices so there's no excuse for not being adventurous be bold find what you like and spice up your cooking marinade in the lamb first chili's we're going to use a mixture of red and green take off the tops and just slice in garlic crushed don't worry about chopping these ultra fine just get it in there cooking for up to three hours everything sort of blends and almost sort of purees itself together smoked paprika goes brilliantly well with the chilis two teaspoons in a touch of dried oregano some little cumin seeds the blend and the fragrance that they give out is extraordinary they release a little oil as well and helps to tenderize the lamb a touch of salt pepper cinnamon that sort of sweetens up the lamb olive oil just a tablespoon and the olive oil helps to sort of stick all those wonderful spices to the lamb jump in just start really rubbing at this stage you can leave the lamb to marinade for anything from half an hour to overnight allowing the spices to really penetrate the meat giving amazing results when you tuck in delicious vegetables carrots and onions and that's it sliced secret slicing vegetables from braising is not getting too thin you slice the onions too thin they burn you've got that horrible char taste on that slow braised grazing it's just a chef's term that means cooking in liquid on a low heat making the meat incredibly moist and beautifully tender so the secret of braising is having a really nice thick durable pan get that nice and hot just a touch of olive oil lamb in hold the bone because you're in control then into the pan i want that white fat to start rendering so it'll add more fat therefore making it a lot more flavoursome as it braises chilies cinnamon in mix that up and don't be scared you're not burning this you're sort of searing the lamb shanks and this is the important part right at the very beginning we're getting the collar on the lamb which washes off as it braises in the oven so be generous with that colour vegetables in wow and then a couple of baileys so now you lift the lamb up and get the lamb sat on top of the vegetables now just glaze the pan with red wine deglazing means that you're you're cleaning the bottom of the pan and you're getting that amazing flavor washed off and lifted up into that sauce can really transform that dish always delays then bring to the boil and cook for about 10 minutes to reduce the wine is reduced down by half now with the stock bring that stock back up to the ball and then into the oven now don't cover it when you cover it all the condensation comes off the lid your lamb becomes gray all this effort and that exciting spice gets washed away no lid and into the oven for three hours a slow cook on a low heat of 160 degrees gives the spices time to work and transform the meat so it's mouthwateringly tender now look at those out on to a plate you can just see that meat sliding down juicy and incredibly tender grab it by the the shank rolling around that rich delicious sauce look at that and get your sauce nice beautiful just get some mint don't chop it just pick that fresh mint and let it snow and there you go a very spicy delicious melting in the mouth lamb shank amazing you

Gordon Ramsay's Ultimate Fit Food/Healthy, Lean and Fit –...",2022-12-03 22:16:02.927159, and when you want a simple supper herbs are perfect to use in your cooking they add vibrancy and amazing depth of flavor and once you get the hang of them they are so quick and simple to use and one woman who really knows these chef's best friends is expert herb grower lorraine melton i love herbs i love the way you can cook with them i love the smell of them she's been growing an incredible array of herbs in the wet cambridgeshire countryside for over 20 years and can smell a bay from a basil at 50 paces we grow about 150 varieties of herbs it's always interesting to grow new varieties see what they taste like see what they smell like it gets a bit addictive after a while broadly speaking you get harder herbs and softer herbs softer herbs are things like parsley basil rocket coriander we grow um two main types of parsley we've got flat leaf parsley and curly parsley flavour-wise i think they're very similar although a lot of people would say that the flat leaf parsley has got a stronger more aromatic flavour this is your common basil sweet genevieves this is a purple variety called ruben we do greek basil thai basil holy basil when you're looking for a basil you want a bright fresh basil nice leaves no blemishes and nice strong stems it's got a lot of oils in it and it's very strong smelling it just tastes a summer basil lorraine certainly knows her stuff and she's right soft herbs are delicate so for maximum flavor always use them at the end of cooking or simply add as they are to cold dishes here are my top five soft herbs that i could never live without [Music] basil as lorraine said it comes in many types all with an amazing sweet punch and flavor great blitzed in pestos sprinkled whole over mozzarella and showing its versatility it even makes a wonderful ice cream parsley beautifully earthy and intensely fresh use both the leaves and the stem for great depth of flavour in savey dressing soups and salads coriander for an amazing hint of citrus often used in thai dishes coriander is perfect in curries and chutneys but it bruises easily so treat it with care tarragon a staple of french cooking this has long soft green leaves and a distinct anti-seed flavor great with chicken or in rich creamy sauces [Music] finally chervil both mild and sweet a perfect pairing with fish an incredible mix simply with melted butter for a quick sauce those are my favorite soft herbs what about the hard ones the harder ones tend to be a more woody plant things like thyme rosemary you've got your common time which is your ordinary general bog standard cooking time and then you've got things like lemon thyme we do an orange thyme which is actually one of my favorites it smells like thyme but it's got a deep sort of musky scent as well which is going to give you a slightly different flavor in your dish hard herbs like thyme can take more intense cooking than soft herbs so they're great in stews roast or pan frying choose the right one and you can add wonderful depth of flavor to your dishes here are my top five i use day in and day out rosemary amazingly robust with great bittersweet green leaves it's a classic paired with lamb delicious sprinkled over speciality breads like focaccia or great as toppings for fruity sorbets lorraine's favorite thyme a heady aromatic pungent herb which adds delicious flavor to a sandy roast it's amazing with wild mushrooms and is perfect in marinades oregano warm and full of delicious aromatic oils a staple of great italian dishes and perfect sprinkled on pizzas or in pasta sauces [Music] sage a strong tasting herb with a deliciously bitter flavour incredible in stuffings and with rich meats like pork or duck finally bae bitter sweet and spicy it's delicious simmered in soups stocks and risottos and just as good dried or fresh grown herbs is a lot easier than people think it is on winter boxes in balconies and it's great you can just open your window put your hand out and snip some off when you're out looking for hers make sure they're nice and healthy no blemishes stems look strong they should just spring back it's a nice springy sort of herbs smell obviously is quite important not all things smell but obviously if you think it's one that's going to smell like lemon thyme you should have a nice fresh lemon scent and obviously the final one is taste you can tip a bit off and taste your herbs and you can see what they taste like them whether bought from a supermarket or pig from your window box herb's a great way to add fresh flavors to your dishes perfect for delicious simple suppers i love this recipe why because it turns this humble ingredient a can of tuna into something delicious just open up and drain the tuna into a sieve just lightly flake that don't press it too hard otherwise you'll dry out the tuna now these are water's chestnuts just slice them nice and thin you can buy them anywhere any supermarket chestnuts in fresh ginger get rid of that rough skin on the outside by grating the ginger you get to get all that really nice sort of juice in take your spring onions and just slice on an angle i like the texture of the water chestnut with a spring onion or touch of fresh coriander lovely next remove the seeds from a chili to reduce its heat without losing any flavor and finely chop chilis in kaffir lime leaves roll them up nice and tight run your knife down the center and just chop and that makes the fish cake nice and fragrant touch of salt a touch of pepper fish sauce just lightly season the tuna to bind all those wonderful ingredients two whole eggs and give that a nice little whisk and then add your eggs get your hands in there and start mixing get the mixture roll it hand to hand and the palm pat them down nicely to cook add a little ground oil to a hot pan at the face of a clock i'm going to go from 12 all the way around first one in these fish cakes only take a few minutes to cook so keeping track of the order they go in the pan means you know which one to turn first [Music] give the pan a nice gentle little shake make sure that nothing's sticking to the bottom spatula two fingers on top turn them over beautiful that crackling noise is something you always want because the tune's already cooked so we're just lightly frying them and get a nice crisp outside gently take them out smell incredible let them sit there we're gonna make a really nice delicious simple dipping sauce start off a little pinch of sugar fish sauce two tablespoons that gives it the saltiness one tablespoon of rice wine vinegar and some fresh lime juice squeeze all that lime in there your fresh coriander lots of coriander and then give that a little mix and then you have the most amazing spicy tuna fish cakes who would have thought something as delicious as that can come out of a can a simple supper in minutes that's so mouth-wateringly easy and delicious you're guaranteed to cook it again and again you

flavoursome flatfish twice as much flavor as the dover salt and more importantly half the price skin side down skin just nip at the end grab it like you're sort of almost pulling hair and let the knife do the work season dill dill and fish go brilliantly because it's got that really nice sort of fennel flavor that sort of aniseed flavor and just roll almost like a sausage leeks carrots spring onions garlic it's a very delicate dainty fish this so we don't want to overpower the garlic and then something to sort of wake them up a little bit thyme rosemary the time goes brilliant with the leeks and the rosemary goes fantastic with the carrots baking paper if i had to put them on my board like that then they're going to curl up so i turn the paper almost inside out add veg we're looking for a bed like a nest of vegetables season and then just drizzle generously with olive oil it looks delicious now it's not even cooked second piece of paper that goes over the top wrap you get the top right hand corner and you just fold that over and then over again fold and push and just follow it round fold and push we've left almost like a little snout white wine what the wine does as that soul is steaming there it makes a really nice aroma with the vegetable the olive oil and keeps everything really nice and light and fruity seal pan on there and push down and look just seals the paper hot oven 20 minutes and this is the bit of magic in and just look oh look at that absolutely delicious and a perfume of the herbs extraordinary soul on papillon done now barney chef yes sophie ollie tommy

the same time thanks a lot let's go good come on come on come on come on what time it is no no no but put them in the oven they look at your watch oh my god nice and tight quick yeah okay so um which level can we we don't sit there and discuss timings open close straight away with the soul i'm serving potatoes with mint and charred with garlic now that's loads before getting it back off a little bit more seasoning yeah and then all we do is just toss it that's all toss it it cooks so quickly that's it so we take it off the stove off the heat okay see how it breaks down yeah yes and we just wilt it very quickly watch watch please there that's it cooked done the lightness of the chard with the jersey royals is a perfect accompaniment you know that see how we still got texture in there so come on please let's go right hello yes taste that tell me what you think it needs that's normal yep more garlic there's not even salt in there either can we have the chard cooked nicely with a bit of texture yes and the reason why it looks like there's nothing in the bowl because we're overcooking it it's like a spinach leaf like a wilted lettuce sleeve nice texture there as well yes put the pan down please straight off there into there and out give it a little shake okay then back into your pan like that and then from there into there okay my mission to get the nation cooking sunday lunch has thrown up some real challenges none bigger than the family without a dining table [Music] we never sit down any together you know the three boys uh liam jordan and luke they're all playing football at different times during the week they're coming in from school and it's everything's rushed so when was the last time we actually sat down together as a family um all together literally yeah all around the table three boys and yourselves i can't remember it's as long ago as that so where would you eat we have like a little bistro table now family of five table could only fit two yeah yeah every night we're out um and our work shifts so there's terms out on nights the only way around this to eat around the table is to come up with something like a stew or casserole right so yeah prepare it on a saturday to reheat for a sunday first off we've got to get a table [Music] we're happy with this one yes yes it's quite nice i think you go well in the kitchen now that's just a really nice chunk of braising steak can i just say though if i was buying this yes um i would be put off if there was a bit of fat like that if there's no fat on there it will go dry so you've got to look for the fat okay whilst mums do that i want you to do the vegetables okay first of all shallots take off this that's the root but we don't take the whole thing off because if you cut the whole root off all the juice will come out of it and then you'll start crying now what the flour does all right it coats the meat and so when the casserole is cooking it gives it a little bit of body and the nice thing about this casserole you know that is the fact that you don't have to be precious with it i've noticed that i thought you were a bit rough yes well nothing with a bit of rough trust me you just take your braising steak don't be scared of this because you're putting color on it and color means flavor yeah i'm gonna put in some really nice smoked bacon i'm gonna smell that try bacon you don't like bacon oh luke i thought you were a chef my man what i'm gonna do now is cook that bacon and then we're gonna put the vegetables on top of it then at the time bay leaves tomato puree the brown meat and finally the stock looks if you think that's tasty now just imagine what it's gonna be like in two and a half hours time so just after 15 minutes preparation tomorrow's lunch is sorted

time supporting luke and the nice thing about it is that everything's done at home lift [Applause] all right guys you ready yep let's go we're two minutes away from getting everybody around the table for the first time in a long time chin chin chin cheers it's not that difficult is it really no absolutely no i'm really confident i'll be able to do it myself okay all of you around the table i want

let's do three yes yeah service please finally i'm gonna do your potatoes as well okay what is your spoon olive oil you need one more [Music] potatoes yeah can you do me a favor and do your own and stop depending on each other to do because that's what's confusing just do your own pan one each one for five one for four end of story there's one more table to come please okay now you can see it's enough for five in there easily yes that's right it's got texture there it's lightly wilted taste it please understand what we're doing yes let's go [Music] service please we're going to 14 yeah [ __ ] listen to me please yes my handmade pigs have been really fattening up nicely over the last couple of months but now the clock is really ticking the pigs won't be around for long but while they're with us i want them to have the best life possible constant access to water every day they can drink up to five liters each a nutritious breakfast of wholesome grains [Music] and these posh pigs have their poo cleared up twice a day the 70 square meters in their pig pen gives them plenty of room to play [Music] these two are very social animals who love each other's company see you later and the pigs spend more than 70 of their time sleeping but the good life doesn't come cheap the way we're keeping these pigs is turning out to be very expensive in terms of just on what they eat every week is on average between sort of 35 40 quid a week on feed for both of them um and so far we spent just over two and a half grand on getting them where they are today they don't look like they've got to worry in hell to be honest what a happy life for a piece of bacon christine co who i bought my boxers from is a passionate advocate of free-range farming but her concerns go way beyond the flavour of meat and she's come to show me how some commercially farmed pigs are kept so i'm fascinated to see how a real commercial pig is sort of reared okay sure look at this yeah most british pigs are reared in commercial unis like these now you see how many pigs are in a very small area god they've got food constantly which is which is good and they've got water and then the whole aim is to just fatten up so don't go outside no they don't i mean an indoor weird pig does not go outside you see fairing crates are used to stop the sows lying on the piglets but it's not natural in the sense that normally a sow would build a nest she would make sure that the piglets were were in a particular place two-thirds of pork in britain is imported from europe and it seems that their standards can be much lower the sours are literally put into rows and rows where they can't turn around these are not legal now in the uk all day all day i mean they can just about lie down but they can't turn around yeah that's gross look at that how many are crammed into an area and bear in mind that we import 858 000 tons of pig meat into the uk yeah again 70 of all of the imports would not meet uk welfare standards but there's another unpleasant practice which is common in the uk and europe tail docking so what they do is because pigs are social animals and they like to have lots of space to run around as we've seen the girls doing if they're in cramped circumstances and they get bad habits and one of the bad habits is they chew each other's tails so so what what they do is they actually take the tails off to save them chewing them oh dear flipping egg but the most disturbing thing for me is castration it's rare in the uk but common in holland and denmark my god i mean just getting a ball in the nuts by playing football or getting kicked in the nuts imagine getting them cut off it looks painful but if it's done in accordance with eu guidelines then piglets over seven days old should be anesthetized as bores get get older and their hormones start coming through then the smell of their urine is very very strong so you get that with a load of of sort of nearly mature bores the smell is going to be horrific so they cast some producers think this smell can tame the meat but whatever the reasons i'm still shocked by what i've seen from europe um it's enough to make anyone turn [ __ ] vegetarian for god's sake and i've always sort of knocked vegetarians and vegans for you know missing out on you know the most amazing flavor you get from meat but you can see why so many people change instantly i didn't think he'd be quite as shocked as he was he seemed really taken aback and it touched him [Music] no way would we ever treat you like that you know hey good girls hey love the flavor of the dill went very well with the with the fish the vegetables were fantastic just thought it was a really good uh good dish i enjoyed it but it wasn't amazing good flavor was simple simple was nice subtle flavors and uh loved it loved it i paid for it where is it okay guys let's go sophie barney let's go okay gordon ollie come over please result to the main course yes yeah he went you went very well 38 upping so only 12 non-paid yeah and what do they say the 12. um slightly too watery but that was the main complaint when they really love it actually it's a delicate dainty

anyway do you [ __ ] mind excuse me okay so i'm frying the onions off first and frying them away they give a little bit of color and then the mint once you've got color on the mints we're just gonna put it in a colander and just leave it to sit there that stops a really greasy sort of film of oil on top of the cottage pie which i don't want so drain it off it's fat and fry off the onions i've drained the mince and i've used the um the water from the carrots to make a stock so i'm putting my potatoes back in the pan basically to dry out and then we'll put them through what they call a ricer and everyone should have one of these at home have you got one of these at home no no what's it do it just pushes the potatoes posh things that it's not posh oh it is look and it just makes sense

state of me when was the last time you worked this hard long time ago i can tell you right we're going in right we're in the oven yes cottage pie with michelle collins shepherd's pie oh [ __ ] here now don't start that again cottage pie oh right are you happy with that why not cappy right it's in there yes actually it looks all right yes but let's just hope it tastes right [Music] i'm really passionate about sourcing fresh local ingredients and you can't get any more local than that the [ __ ] river thames running past your back door there's nothing more british in the pot of jelly deals and for hundreds of years they were our favorite fast food snack but now they're so unpopular the wildlife fish industry is in danger of dying out altogether no no no no no that's disgusting they're slimy nobody's sick the thames is the cleanest metropolitan river in the world it's teeming with life above and below the waterline including the much maligned eel so why is dave pierce the only commercial ill fisherman left oh really the market has dropped a lot and when the market drops the money drops yep why is it not a trendy thing to be doing on the thames because there's so little demand for eels in britain dave sells his entire catch to holland where wild eels are considered a great delicacy right how do you catch an eel we're going to show you shall we yep i can see him coming through there oh yeah and now you pull up billy oh thank you i've never caught a wild deal dave now you've got three there by looks of it okay yeah there's three hills in the first end nice size there's a big one though yeah yeah that's the size you don't want them too big they're too big to eat if you're getting too big in there yeah they're showing yeah there's a pound and a half come on two-pound lady it's beautiful look yeah and that's nearly 20 years old that day could well be here thanks dave all right mike good to see you man it's crazy that we're ignoring our wild eels they're part of our culinary heritage and i want to make sure that they don't disappear from our tables [Music] first stop frank bradley who after 40 years in the ill business is an expert in the art of killing eels apparently it's a bugger of a job how many years have you been headed oh i don't know we do three times a week so it's about three tons of meals a week yeah so it's a lot of hills so the secret is what the secret is when you get older you yeah that's it then gut then when they're live like this that's always trying to turn up here split the bow and knot that guard shall we go yeah so down down straight on on the fins ah for [ __ ] sake yeah i'll take the one on the bench there you go on the side of the fins there like on the side of the fence just straight down oh my god say the art is to hold them gently that's it [Music] the [ __ ] thing's still moving oh he still wants to take it's just like a chicken unbelievable i mean i was every day i'm getting past myself by the day your heels keep me young you're famed for your jelly deals what's the secret behind the recipe in terms of you know jelly deals the only deal is that the the art of cooking eels is when they're overcooked they fall apart yeah but if they're undercooked they're hard as rocks and what'd you cook yours in we just boil them in water and water yeah and so much comes out and then all you do is add a little bit of gelatine a little bit of salt and then when we get them out so they're beautiful jelly meals [Music] that is delicious the flavor is amazing huh i'm gonna get these off cook them and help sort of change the nation's attitude to something squeamish that can be absolutely delicious jelly deals have been served in london's traditional pie mash shops for years daily deals not as popular as i used to be mate really hopefully i'm gonna change that i'm gonna do something a little bit more sort of um not delicate but just a little bit more flavor sounds lovely yeah ready yeah kitchen where is it kitchen's that way help yourself now there's more than one way than cooking an eel and it doesn't have to be in a jelly now i'm going to boil them in water and then coat them with breadcrumbs almost like a really nice posh fish finger into the pan salt pepper two thirds of the way with water bring the water up to the boil and then just poach them for three or four minutes while we're waiting for the eels to boil i'm going to season the breadcrumbs now that's just normal white breadcrumbs in here we've got some nice fresh chopped parsley salt a teaspoon of cayenne pepper and some finely grated nutmeg now drain the eels once they've been poached get your butter lightly melted and then just drop that into the breadcrumbs this is where the posh fish finger comes out pat them nicely and look how sexy is that into the oven and then just before we serve them a drop of fresh lemon juice there's nothing squeamish about that bait teal in the herb crust beautiful not even a hint of slime let's see if this persuades those winds to give eels a chance you're happy with that yeah nice thank you have you eaten meals before never tried them why not because it's just something i've never even thought about being don't like the look slime jelly or just yeah probably it's all that right really yeah as i thought take the eel out the jelly and bob's your uncle i've been fine they're [ __ ] beautiful excellent delicious yeah so what do you think thank god for that okay did you enjoy the main course no no go on it was like a fedex package in the middle like that i couldn't get boot with the knife some sort of like parcel and when i got in there unpappy never mind that papi art it was not good but we've got pictures of that garden i heard you've got pigs in that garden i have pictures are they old sports are they no they're little baby pigs they're bred to be small that's sugar pie that's not a pig it's a little baby pizza sweet pig and we used to have them in the house is it duracell battery people was it a real pizza it's a lovely sugar pine she's nice i pick her up and cuddle her and she she used to come and sit on my lap while i was watching doctor who you do and if it was scary it's a couple of eyes look there's jack who's our [ __ ] so having a talk with them and you leave them outside or well we did have them living in the house but unfortunately the smell of piss got too much even for me okay did you enjoy the film uh yes i did enjoy seeing neil from i like it but i tried cooking some for my wife once i bought you because she loved you all fresh no i didn't my friends i bought it frozen right and also it was a couple of days past the sell by day but i thought that wouldn't be bad and it smelled like when i got it out but i thought once i cook it up she won't notice the rice was perfect cheapskate the ear wasn't so good and then i put more sauce on the normal and shaved it and she was vomiting in the bath within an hour but i like that because the view was spectacular you're fluent in japanese not fluent well getting a little bit tsukashi that's not bad you love japanese cuisine i love it yes i've got the most amazing treat for you in the kitchen by a top japanese eel specialist i'll wait you know you'll make me kill it you eat them you've got to kill the bloody things i don't know that's what i play less something to do right listen it's enough for dizzy actually jane's going to love it oh she will and this is an expert she's just saying she needs to laugh with this you have to get yourself in the mood no no no this man is an expert and he's going to show us how to prepare an ideal okay so very gently pull this away please there you go don't upset him we're about to kill it there you how long does it take to become a skilled eel man chef is very unique one unique yeah yeah so at least five or six years five or six years yeah they're specialists aren't they yeah so it's not just like filleting a normal fish no no but when you kill it like this does it feel any pain i don't think you cannot feel it no then just don't because it should be very hard to stay here being because you cannot open it you see you just realized i've got i'm on a parking meter look i'll see you stay here you win how can i get cleaned wait don't yes have you seen this done before no not in japan no amazing absolutely amazing never seen anything like that it's still beating several hours after oh my goodness look at that why is he still going what's your gun what did did he have a red ball before you killed him because he was a very strong creature um how would you eat that in japan now still pulsating what would you do just to put on your tongue then jonathan what did you have a bite oh i go on then if you have someone i'll have some toss a coin all right oh yes that way it's fair all right yeah heads or tails okay it's still [ __ ] pulsating yeah so how do you do it just on your tongue with water i'll do it i'll do it you're sure or swallow not chewy just swallow it without it then just good later yes okay thank you very much right dessert yeah the secret behind the tatang is getting a really nice caramelization on there it's the same with apples pears even pineapple to a certain extent yeah first thing you need is a basic caramel using butter and sugar you can do in advance and leave it to cool so your pans are ready when you are so plums now like any tatan try and compact them in there like that yeah so when they compact like that okay basically okay they don't move okay yeah yeah so there's eight seven or eight six of the big ones okay pastry nip it with your fingers at the end and we do that to tuck the pastry yeah under the plum pastry over see and that's wider than the pan so over yeah get the back of your spoon lift up the pastry lift up the plum and tuck it's really important to manipulate the pastry with your fingertips okay this is even simpler than the [ __ ] prawn toast push down tuck the pastry under that's ready to go you put a little hole in the center there okay and that lets the air come out okay and that stops the plums from steaming okay into the center of the stove yeah and what we're gonna do now is we're gonna bring it up on the stove to melt we're not gonna melt it in the oven okay yeah if we put in the oven straight away it just boils it i want to get a really nice color on there yeah get the camel really nice and hot now it's coming up to the top okay you can see the steam coming through the little hole there now if we didn't put the hole in there it goes soggy underneath and everyone thinks the pastry is undercooked but it's not it's just soggy pastry from there into the oven eight to ten minutes oh that's sorry that's the first one right okay watch again please be very very careful that is piping hot out in oh wow with a juice like that that's a nice smell for you now we're getting part of that come fresh clean bunny right we've got to do that now judy everyone is capable of doing that out here that's amazing the plums have still got a nice texture the pastry's cooked it's caramelised yeah let's stick together on this one yeah yeah and get 50 customers paying double for that yes yes let's go next on the menu i find out if michelle collins cooks better than al del zilli what they say they like both of them but there is one who actually they prefer and my student brigade get their results okay john baptist hey got it remove the results um [Music] [Applause] welcome back now judgment time for michelle collins ready to serve they don't like nipples actually they do lower nipples hello okay first one very creamy creamy isn't it no i don't i like the mashed potatoes it's not too crispy either it's nice it's a gravy i actually really like that see this looks like a cupcake i prefer the actual look and really crispy are on the top this time as well there's no sauce okay they went down well yes very well yeah what they say they like both of them but there is one who actually they prefer of course and uh i'm sorry michelle's gordon yes i'm sorry yeah yeah they're very close they thought that gordon's ones were a bit more flavory the mash was more uh you know just because they used a well done my darling but no now do me a favor yes yes i'm up to my eyeballs and shake all right go pop out the kitchen thank you my darling good luck okay [Music] we take these over to the hot plate watch service please table one first yes right barney come here yes please cloudy cream in the center two seconds in the center on top they look fantastic by the way yes right please uh table one john baptist yes clear that way please again please be careful yes watch the juice look very very careful go table one please yes let's go jump back to stable one let's go they start sticking yep okay just release them again on top of the stove okay they're beautiful they are fantastic just worked i thought it was really soggy and really sour as like at all the pastry was sweet the plums were a bit bitter and it just worked perfectly i absolutely adored it i'm going to 100 pay for that course i like this you like that yes was that butter or cream on top uh no that was a like a clotted cream a devonshire cream nice rich i like that yes what about the tart the plum tart it's not eel hard but it's not bad jean-baptiste yeah come here please yes john right this is getting more and more like jimmy carr every time i see him okay ah this is this has been grilled oil by the way joe baptist is french there's no point in talking japanese to you know that you say he's not friendly from vermont [Music] that is good that's good very good you know he hasn't overdone the sauce often you get when you go to a knots it's a good japanese restaurant they'll overdo that sauce on top which is quite a rich like sweet sauce yeah japanese pepper i ate his pulsating heart and then i'm feasting on his flesh an amazing delicacy are you happy with that this is good i can eat this until the cows come home and you've started them good to see you i'm glad you're going to pay for dinner you're tight bastard some of it come on all of it come on you're not short of a penny well [Applause] [Music] done okay john baptist right got it what's the results 18 are paying and 32 are not paying 32 not paying yeah it's ridiculous quite a lot yeah why uh the main reason is it's too acidic it's not sweet enough it's a new season plan for god's sake they're just philistines yeah well let's have a quick look overall okay 83 paid out of 150 plates that's not even a [ __ ] 2-2 tommy is it no no no no no no ah if you're in my [ __ ] kitchen all four we've got sacked after the [ __ ] prawn toast now will you do me a favor [ __ ] off over there and get a drink yes absolutely you

Gordon Ramsay's Ultimate Fit Food/Healthy, Lean and Fit – http://po.st/REpV...",2022-12-03 22:16:02.927159, knowledge is crucial the more you know about where your ingredients come from and how they're produced the better so ask lots of questions and learn when it comes to buying pork you can't do any better than ask a butcher and award winning master butcher danny lidgate knows everything about the pig from trotter to tail this family have been in the meat business for 150 years so this man really is on the money in comparison with other meats pork's really good value you get some really good cuts at really reasonable prices and you can use everything from the tip of the trotter down to the cheek we can see here we've got the leg the leg is about this region really lean really good for things like gammons and hams coming down from the leg we've got the loin and that's where the pork chops come from if you take the bones out you can bone and roll it and you end up with a really nice easy to cook cylinder of meat really easy to carve carve like a loaf of bread coming away from the loin we've got the belly and you can see what belly is made up of fatty parts and meaty parts don't be scared of the amount of fat that's on it you need that fat to give give the flavours coming through also make sure you can possibly buy it with the skin on the skin will crispen up nicely give you good crackling also add flavor into the fat lower down from the bellies we've got the shoulders really the shoulders are a great meat they're slightly fattier than the rest of the animal you can see with this pork shoulder the amount of marbling you get in the mussels the interior marbling make sure you look for the marbling it's essential for the flavour and it's going to make a really good eating experience a pig there really is nothing to waste the trust is even a really good flavor because they're gelatinous qualities and the meat can be really really flavoursome also there's pigs cheeks which obviously require a little bit more cooking because of the use they get but the flavors you're gonna get are gonna be completely different to any other part of a pig pork is an incredibly versatile meat they say the only part you can't eat is the oink here's my guide to getting the best out of familiar cuts smoked or unsmoked bacon is not just for breakfast it's brilliant transforming salads gives a real depth of flavour to stews and is delicious in quick and easy pasta dishes the leg joint best known for ham also makes inexpensive delicious sunday roast and is great serve with peas pudding and the tenderloin fill it incredibly lean healthy and fast to cook you can stuff it cut it into scallops or strips that are perfect for asian stir-fries cooking dishes in advance is a brilliant way of taking the stress out of cooking at home and many dishes just get better and better with time first up my amazing sticky pork ribs one of the secrets to great cooking is patience leaving dishes to marinade for one or two days helps to develop the flavor in your food and the end result so much more delicious it's a method i use in the restaurants all the time first off get your roasting tray put the tray on the gas pork ribs 60 meat and 35 40 fat give them a really good season salt and pepper nice thing about this cut they stay incredibly moist when they're on the bone and the longer you cook them the more delicious they become just push all that seasoning in to the pork olive oil in make sure that tray is nice and hot and i really want that nice sort of caramelization taking place on the pork that's the nice thing about starting it on top of the stove use your roasting tray get them colored and then the oven putting the ribs straight in the oven you don't get the color it looks sort of boiled as opposed to a nice caramelized rib ginger you can't beat fresh ginger with sticky pork ribs place it down nice and firmly and slice the thinner you slice the ginger the more fragrant the ribs garlic now it's really important before you add anything to those ribs make sure you've got the color from the ribs first don't rush it turn them over that's what i want that nice crispy color as they sort of braise in the oven all that color just turns into the most amazing flavor braising is just a chef's turn for cooking something slowly in liquid right ginger and garlic in spread it around on all those ribs to sort of roast the ginger and the garlic chili flakes chili flakes in next sichuan pepper citrusy vibrant peppercorns incredible in next star anise that gives it a really nice sort of anisd flavor almost like you're roasting the ribs in fennel and now we've got the heat the spice i want to sweeten things up a little bit some fresh honey honey glazes the pork beautifully counteracts against all that spice in there but look what's happening a color on the ribs is extraordinary it's like a really nice chili sweet caramel now soy sauce brings that little bit of sort of saltiness to it really generous with the soy sauce japanese vinegar two tablespoons of vinegar in rice wine it gives it that nice sort of tartness the ribs if you can't find rice wine our dry sherry is a great substitute 300ml that takes out the heat of that szechuan pepper those dry chili flakes make sure they all lay down like a nice tight box of matches bring that up to the boil cooking is all about learning to develop your own likes and dislikes so always keep tasting to make sure you're happy with a combination of flavors it's lacking a little touch of vinegar what that sharpness now think what's going on the tartness the heat the caramel the color on the ribs is amazing i want a bit of a sort of oniony flavor we'll put some springs in whilst these ribs are in the oven the spring onions will sort of puree but give a sharpness to the final taste of that pork in with my spring onions and with my stock 400 ml of stock this is just a simple chicken stock the stock just sits underneath the ribs it absorbs into the rib and the top of the rib glazes underneath the rib that gets crispy and rich and that's what makes the ribs nice and moist really important into the oven cook at 180 for 30 minutes then turn the ribs over and cook for a further 30 minutes [Music] now wow they smell incredible each side has got that really nice crispy roasted edge becomes sticky and chewy and sweet sour the fats disappeared and the pork just melts in your mouth i want to take them to the next level gas back on now shake the tray and this is the sort of the way that we finish them in the restaurant but every minute they glaze in that tray they just get to taste better and better now look at them i'm so happy with those ribs done absolutely delicious now but if you want you can put them in the fridge and the flavor will keep developing then just reheat them when you want to serve so each rib has a nice slice of ginger on there

...",2022-12-03 22:16:02.927159, my shopping mantra is simple first rely on your senses make sure whatever you're buying it looks smells and really feels good and if you get the chance taste it before you buy it second is to recognize that knowledge is crucial the more you know about where your ingredients come from and how they produce the better so ask lots of questions and learn you're never too old to learn from experts and when it comes to buying great birds one person knows what to look for is award-winning fifth generation master butcher danny lid gain poultry is a great meat because there's many different types of birds it's worth tasting the variation of flavours between different first to birds is massive turkey's a great lean meat that's available all year round not just for christmas anybody who's worried about eating fatty meats it's a really healthy flavoursome meal game birds people don't try them often enough once they're shot they're hung up for a little while but a few days at least it means the meat's going to be more tender it all adds flavor to the birds we've got a wood pigeon and a red leg partridge both really good and cook really quickly when you're buying a chicken some of the things to look out for is obviously the smell and when you're smelling a good quality chicken you can tell the difference the skin's a nice white color and it smells like a fresh chickeny smell when you're buying from a good butcher you'll find you tend to get the giblets as well which is basically the neck and other organs this is great for making gravy once you have cooked it you can use all the offcuts for other things stir fries curries pasta dishes save the bones use the bones for stocks and soups they're really packed full of flavor and remember there are lots of different breeds of chicken all have different characteristics and flavors so shop around and find the ones you love here are three of my all-time favorites the label anglais these come from an old british breed they've got smaller breasts but the meat's delicious the black leg a fantastic french variety succulent with bags of flavour and really meaty thighs and the pulley divorce this is the rolls royce of chickens rich gamey and delicious one for special occasions i think people should maybe try and buy less meat but aim for the best quality you're only going to get out what you put in by putting the best quality into a dish you're going to get the best results my next recipe is an old classic roast chicken but with a simple twist it takes on a new life and is guaranteed to impress one of the things i love about cooking and that keeps me excited after 25 years behind the stove is that there's always something new to learn every day new ingredients new techniques and new cuisines start off with the stuffing it's amazing how exciting a stuffed roast chicken can be because it keeps the chicken incredibly moist and gives a delicious texture inside the bird i'm going to start off with cured ceriso this is a traditional spanish sausage and it's garlicky spicy incredibly meaty that gives a little bit of sort of richness to the stuffing get our chorizo in start cooking that down and getting all those oils out a little touch of olive oil in there to get it going right onions chopped add the onions to the cerezo and in a matter of seconds they'll change color as they soak up all the flavor that lovely spiciness has been stolen from that sausage now the onions smell incredible garlic garlicky fresh thyme just hold it down and put your fingers on there and it's a really nice way of taking off all those nice fragrant little time flowers you can hear it crackling in the background these are cannellini beans they're waxy very soft and so delicious but very dense but for stuffing they're so robust nothing breaks down drain them off in they're going to take on all that juice as well from the freezer i'm going to season them now because they're very dense so it needs some help i mean that looks like it's a dish on its own good enough to eat now i want to sweeten things up a little bit tomatoes half dried in that sweetens up the stuffing beautiful the stuffing's ready look at the color everything looks spanish it looks delicious now stuffing the chicken i like taking off these little knuckles as the chicken cooks the skin stretches over the bone you can get a really nice drum and take off those little wingtips as well salt pepper so important now you're stuffing i'm gonna go right inside the chicken push it down this really helps to cook the bird evenly because you're pushing out all the empty spaces in the carcass and take a nice large lemon push the lemon in pick up the person's nose pull the skin over olive oil on top salt and pepper a teaspoon of paprika sprinkle it on and then get your hands and sort of rub that in and see what the paprika is doing to the chicken putting this like sweet spicy marinade it's not even roasted yet but it looks delicious [Music] 400ml of white wine same quantity of water that helps the chicken to steam chicken in be generous with the time sprigs [Music] make sure the fall is folded tightly around the roasting tray so the chicken steams in the oven keeping it moist and juicy into the oven [Music] cook for one hour at 180 degrees with a foil on nice take it out and remove the full lid then give it another 30 minutes to crisp up that skin look at that it's so important to make sure you take that tinfoil off with half an hour to go beautiful pierce that open squeeze it in that delicious gravy mix that into the tray and sieve that that's really nice fragrant lemony spiced roasting juices to finish before we cut up the chicken take out that amazing stuffing [Music] incredible i'd have that with chicken over potatoes any day and then just get your chicken roasting juices now to cut the chicken up hold the drum and slice straight through and there's a wonderful drum and a thigh through the wishbone off slice with the point at an angle so you can see the texture of that amazing roast chicken just take my cooking juices just want to give a nice sort of lemony flavour over my chicken and there you go a delicious very charming stuffed roast chicken you

thank you really good nice to see holly get our hands to that door i think we all agree for dessert it's an incredible but easy hazelnut meringue tower guaranteed to wow your mates start with the basic meringue separate four egg whites [Music] and whisk gradually add caster sugar [Music] until the mix forms stiff glossy peaks gently fold in ground and chopped hazelnuts [Music] a trick we use in the restaurants is to use the mix to stick baking sheets down which makes them easy to spread and stops the sheets blowing around [Music] top meringues with more finely chopped hazelnuts and bake for 25 minutes and the trick to stop them cracking is to turn the oven off and let them cool inside for the filling melt dark chocolate in a bowl over simmering water and slightly cool whip the cream until it forms soft peaks and gently fold in three quarters of the melted chocolate until combined build your tower with alternate layers of chocolate cream and meringue [Music] finally drizzle over

favorite this one isn't it i just like the it has a nice sweetness but then it has a bitterness to it too nice thanks to virgin why do we have to use a whisk not just a spoon the purpose of using a whisk is so it can emulsify and more importantly you're bringing all the ingredients together taste it's so yummy that is delicious isn't it a good tip to loosen any vinaigrette and give it a lighter

green salad it's always a winner with your buddies work mates or family megan you gonna help with the duck danny your favorite yes it is now how's your boyfriend right i'm going come on that woke you up didn't it so what do you love most about duck the dipping sauce the dipping sauce i love that let's get the duck in the oven first let's get a bit of salt in there please then some pepper thank you some spring onion garlic and ginger now why do you think we pour that in there to season it and flavor it how come you put them in hole like that and not smaller it's going inside i'm not using it for sauce or anything so it's just gonna make it really nice star anise sorry so what happens as the duck roasts on the outside it creates this really nice perfume aroma inside tuck that in there to get it spicy rub all that chinese fire spice yeah over almost like you're massaging good so make sure you get it all in even the little wings you know underneath there just like i used to do to you my bath i used to wash your little handys i know those days are long gone i know i know i know i should die that is seriously spicy with the duck there's generally quite a lot of fat there yeah so we're gonna put it on this little bench okay and that goes there by slowly roasting it okay it's gonna get nice and crisp on the outside all that fat is gonna render inside the breast so therefore it's gonna get all nice and juicy yeah right ducks in three and a half hours at 160 degrees celsius your favorite part you said was the dipping sauce why is it your favorite part i think it really adds to the dark it makes it really tasty seen as is your favorite no you can make it i'm gonna do nothing okay daddy's gonna put his feet up so uh first off the garlic there's one good girl watch your fingers please always do good nice oh you're fast huh watch your fingers i am watch your fingers slide slow down please 14. all right that's enough right a little teaspoon of olive oil in a few years time i'll be teaching you how to drive as well as cook how exciting is that you know in a car scary okay garlic in crispy duck is traditionally served with hoisin sauce but my brood love the additional big bold punch of black beans nice megan and i add soy sauce and lastly for that classic chinese sweet and sour element brown rice vinegar and honey [Music] are you happy with the flavour i'm really happy you can taste everything in there dipping sauce done duck's in the oven let's start the dessert the most amazing tata tan are those pink peppercorns they are pink peppercorns they're really good they don't taste anything like black peppercorns quite sweet aren't they they're really sweet very fruity the pink peppercorns give it the sweetness the black peppercorns give the heat now what is that baby vanilla this is one of the easiest desserts in the world to make but one of the most delicious it's a sort of take on the classic apple or pear to tan but when you caramelize those bananas with the peppercorns and the vanilla i bet that tastes amazing oh my goodness incredible okay i'm gonna make the caramel start off with the coal pen first and you just press that butter in there how come do you do it like that and not let it just melt naturally because i want the butter to stay cold because i'm gonna stick the bananas in there okay and then we'll make the caramel and caramelize the bananas at the same time so in goes those vanilla vanilla seeds pods in there as well okay peppercorns done yeah well done good girl sprinkle them over that butter just naturally naturally yeah nice and then look just very carefully sprinkle sugar over that you're doing them all the same size roughly the same size wedge it into the butter well do you know what want the bananas really caramelised you just stuck them between if you cram them in like this okay it will stop them moving around nothing's moving nothing is okay it's all wedged in there spreading the peppercorns on top of the bananas so you've got that flavor in the caramel and the top and the bottom right puff pastry puff pastry is difficult and time consuming to make so i always buy ready made when i'm at home to get the best flavor and texture go for the all butter type and keep your pastry cold before using it this is where it gets really exciting you get your fingers you just pinch the ends so you thin the end if you do that for me very carefully have to be quick because the heat your fingers can melt the pastry how comes you do it dad because we get it nice and thin so we can clip it underneath now take a spoon and what we do is lift up that banana and tuck it underneath see little parcel like a parcel and see the thin bits of pastry yeah how easy it is to get it underneath yeah and that's why you thin them out you do it so quickly well because i have to be quick otherwise the pastry will melt notice how we're not using anything sharp so we're not would that cut the pastry that's right see how locked down that is [Music] gas on we'll start caramelizing that those three little holes are so important if we didn't put a hole in the pastry and it will cause a lot of steam so the pastry never cooks it just goes really soggy okay so really important the caramel is live now we're working the camel give a little shake how can you see the caramel through the pastry look what happens when it tilts oh yeah see all comes running down see yeah nicey now that pastry okay it's like clinging on to the bananas and so when we turn it upside down we've got this glove full of these caramelised bananas look at that wow it looks lucky look a locky look a locky ah look at likey got it now baby is your birthday soon 15. i've just worked out i'm my 50th you're 18. perfect we should do a joint party yeah love it 12 2 4 for the old ones twelve lunches time till four for the old one so they can go to sleep megan we'll go on later come on perfect this is where i get excited now look at the color of that caramel so tilt the pan again see how dark it is now yeah wow it's going a lot darker now it didn't take long didn't take long at all that's nearly ready for the oven but before i put that in i'll get the duck out wow how's the duck doing crispy wow and delicious how crispy that is it's really crispy that's what happens when it slow cooks so 20 minutes for the duck to rest and 20 minutes in the oven 190 to 200 degrees for our banana tartar tan time to knock up a quick hoisin and cucumber salad to put in our crispy duck pancakes for the dressing combine hoisin sauce rice wine vinegar soy sauce a dash of sesame oil and to give it that zingy asian punch some freshly grated root [Music] ginger [Music] for the salad trim and cut spring onions into very fine matchsticks peel a whole cucumber into long thin ribbons and shred in a couple of baby gem lettuces season and toss this fresh crunchy salad in the sweet yummy hoisin dressing a combination that never fails to get the kids eating their greens wow look at that so see now where that pastry is caramelizing the caramel so dark and just a little tip gas back on and that will release it because if you tip it and it's still sticking then some of your bananas will stick yeah so now see when it starts spinning around like that moving around and here we are the moment of truth when you know your daddy is the best chef in the world ready yep wow the vanilla how delicious you look at that amazing smells really good as well right start to stand out done crispy dipping sauce cucumber salad ready so if you take them and your dipping sauce take them over thank you i'll take the duck don't drop it promise oh okay my ultimate big and bold dinner of crispy roast duck with pancakes with a hoisin dressed salad and some extra oomph from megan's favorite black bean dipping sauce you

Gordon Ramsay's Ultimate Fit Food/Healthy, Lean and Fit –...",2022-12-03 22:16:02.927159, one of the biggest bills in the kitchen is going to be for meat so it's crucial you keep cost down but that doesn't mean sacrificing flavor especially when you use some slow cooking magic to get the best from cheap cuts to get value for money it always pays to ask an expert and fifth generation award-winning master butcher danny lidgate is a man in the know one of the great things about going to a butcher is they're gonna have more cuts available than most supermarkets so you're gonna see things that people don't know about so one example might be the beef ribs a great product for slow cooking in the oven especially cooking on the bone you're going to get more flavors from the bone and some really nice pieces of juicy meat these only used for mince in the past now people are using it for braising or slow braising or even barbecuing it with some really nice marinades the ox tail are less popular now than maybe they used to be small little mussels make up the tail once that's slow cooked they all fall apart really tender juicy meat also oxtail is sublime in stews curries and soups another great cheap cut for slow cooking is one you saw me using earlier lambs breast it's one of the least expensive cuts of lamb and it's also delicious slow roasted or stewed here we have the shin of beef where you can see in the shins made up of lots of little different muscles these are always moving always doing work so slow cooking will give the best end results it's gonna have fashion a little bit but it should be enjoyed by everybody it's a fantastic piece of meat here we have some ox cheeks and when they're trimmed you end up with a really lean piece of meat obviously with the cheek the cow's always eating munching on grass this means they need a lot of cooking but essentially it's a really nice healthy lean piece of meat with fantastic flavors ox cheeks also make an incredible ravioli or ragu and if you're a pork lover why not try pork neck it's a succulent alternative for a slow sunday roast here we have a muscle from the shoulder it's called feather blades the reason it's called feather blades because when it's cut each piece looks like a feather the gristle tends to be slow cooked and the more it's cooked will turn gelatinous giving a lovely jelly and juicy liquid to the meat fantastic for casseroling pies and stews there are so many cheaper cuts which are brilliant for home cooking it's important with all these forgotten cuts to find out how to cook them don't be scared of them they're really economic but full of flavor and the end result is fantastic meal as a chef one of the biggest kicks i get is taking an ingredient that doesn't cost much and turning into something that looks and tastes like a million bucks my next recipe turns what used to be a decidedly unfashionable cut of meat into the star of the dish fit to grace any table slow roasted pork belly with fennel roasting works better on fattier tougher and unfashionable cuts whether it's a cheek or even a neck or this amazing pork belly it's a fantastic way to transform cheap cuts into amazing melting perfection take a very sharp knife bring the pork belly towards you so you're over it and you've got all that pressure and weight using the tip of the knife i'm just sort of nicking it and go across the pork belly long strokes with a knife take your time turn it 180. this time what we're doing is just sort of cutting those nice little sort of diamonds but as that starts roasting on top it starts getting nice and crispy take your handfuls of salt and just sort of rub it in bend it over in all those cracks really helps to get a nice crisp crackling on top roasting tray getting really nice and hot take a hole over fennel to intensify flavor and to keep the meat succulent i'm braising my pork belly with strong vibrant spices and vegetables crush and peel three whole cloves of garlic and add to the fennel olive oil in fennel in i like the nice strong aniseed flavor that goes with that nice rich dense pork fennel seeds delicious star anise in and just a couple of cardamom seeds and wow they're like little bangers like little firecrackers incredible lovely fresh bay leaves get your pork skin side down just sear the top of that fat that locks in all that amazing flavor then i'm gonna flip it over and get it nice and crispy and then i want fennel seeds embedded in those little cracks now some white wine the minute that white wine hits that pan you can smell that light fragrance from the fennel allow the wine to bubble away and reduce until the alcohol has burnt off time out the stock now the stock goes in just underneath the skin so it roasts on top all that meat under there will be submerged because what happens in the oven the top goes crispy as anything and the stock reduces and brazes at the same time really importantly bring that back up to the ball before it goes in the oven otherwise it will never boil never get up to temperature smells incredible slow roast the pork belly at 180 degrees for two and a half hours [Music] look at that you've got that nice crispy skin on top you can see how much of the stock has evaporated put that onto the board it looks stunning to make a delicious rustic sauce with the flavour packed contents of the roasting tray first get rid of the excess fat take a couple of slices of bread it's like a perfect sponge because you just lay that on top and drag it almost like a net and it just absorbs all that fat if you want the perfect fried bread trust me stick that in a frying pan a nice teaspoon of mustard whisk that in and then simply simmer for a few minutes before pouring into a serving jug with your pork belly always use a nice serrated edge knife you can hear that that is amazing incredibly tender that belly of pork is gonna almost melt in your mouth you've got that sweet meat under that crispy belly of pork what an amazing way to cook a very cheap cut of meat [Music] first up easy bolito misto a classic italian mixed meat dish [Music] i'm starting with some italian fennel sausages [Music] fry them until colored making sure all sides are nicely browned [Music] set them aside then slice chorizo a spicy spanish sausage with a wonderful smoky taste and fries so releases all its incredible flavor [Music] next chop carrots celery garlic and add to the same pan this keeps in all the flavor stirring the pre lentils these are excellent for slow cooked dishes because they retain their firm texture and shape next add a bay leaf and some fresh thyme sprigs then the sausages go back in along with chicken stock simmer until the lentils are tender then season to taste finely sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve simple to prepare a cinch to make and packed full of delicious hearty flavors my twist on an italian classic magnificent easy bolito mister my next everyday effortless dish is slow cooked aubergine dice the aubergine and fry in hot olive oil until coloured on all sides then add a finely sliced onion and chop garlic cook until tender add cooked butter beans and pomegranate molasses which is a sweet thick and glossy tangy reduction of pomegranate juice season [Music] next add a can of chopped tomatoes bring to a simmer and cook until the aubergine has a gloriously soft and silky texture stir through chopped mint pile onto toasted bread and finally for a lovely salty tang crumble over some creamy feta cheese minimum preparation but slow cook for maximum flavor aubergines like you've never tasted before [Music] one more dish that uses time to transform a humble ingredient is perfect slow cooked beef start by frying the beef shin in hot oil seasoning as you go this is a very economical cut of beef as it slow cooks it also makes the most delicious gravy as the marrow thickens and flavors the sauce [Music] in the same pan sausage chopped carrots peeled whole shallots sliced celery peeled and chopped ginger and garlic next add tomato puree and cook for a few minutes [Music] add the shin back into the pan with a glass of dry white wine and the juice of an orange this deglaze in the pan adding incredible depth of flavor [Music] pour in chicken stock season and simmer for an hour and 20 minutes this dish is brilliant finished with gremolata a dry italian salsa made with chopped herbs simply chop parsley and garlic together and mix in the zest of an orange or lemon when the beef is cooked rich anxious and

If you liked...",2022-12-03 22:16:02.927159, my guide to buying the best beef and steaks if you want the ultimate brunch you can't do any better than start with a perfect steak and one man who really knows his steak is master butcher danny lidgate steak is my favorite type of meat and i think it's really good to enjoy different varieties of steak when choosing a steak that you want you need to look at exactly what you want out of it for my ultimate steak sandwich i used to fill it because it's the most tender the philip does the least amount of work than all the other muscles is tucked away in the rib cage this means that when you find a phillips it's incredibly soft like butter it's the most expensive but you get what you pay for there's a wide array of cuts to choose from all different in taste and texture if in doubt ask your butcher this would be the rump section where the rump comes from which is basically the back side take the bone out and what you're left with is a wonderful steak rum steak characteristically a little bit tougher than the sirloin or a little bit chewier than the rib eye but a really strong flavor for the steak again when frying rump look for the marbling try and get some fat covering on the steak you can always cut it off after it's cooked rumps one of the best value steaks i love it thinly cut and flash fried in stir fries or simply marinated and whacked on the barbecue another great value but delicious cut is the hangar steak known as the butcher's cut because they often keep it for themselves it's great marinated and cooked quickly [Music] with the sirloin which is basically the back of the animal a nice sirloin like this really well marbled don't buy too lean so once the sirloin is trimmed up it looks something like this not too much fat but you need a little bit to cook in it next to the sirloin is the rib really popular now with rib eyes small nice really tender juicy steaks it's really special for barbecuing or grilling fantastic probably my favorite steak would be a ribeye rib eye is especially delicious because the marbling in the meat loads it with flavor for a full-on steak experience try the t-bone steak with a small tender fillet steak on one side of the bone and a larger flavor some sirloin on the other [Music] take your butcher's advice and you won't go wrong the final word has to go to danny when buying me knowledge really is power so it's important to ask as many questions about the meet you're buying find out the breed how it's aged and decide exactly what you want to do each particular job that should then give you a really amazing end product one of my all-time favorites a dish that always creates a stir is the daddy of all brunches steak sandwiches [Music] for me the secret of a great brunch is fun and casual fuss-free cooking and everyone helping themselves this is the ultimate steak sandwich you want the rolls royce of beef it has to be fillet now season it beautifully i like to open up the top of the peppermill to increase the size of the pepper in the steak so it gives that bit of heat nice little chunks you just roll now nicely all the way around now slice the garlic in half pan nice and hot olive oil in hold the steak and just place it into the pan don't drop it at the front of the pan we're going to tilt the pan forward to cook the back of the steak dual purpose now roll it back and sear underneath next my garlic and roast that garlic time fry that time i want to hear it we're not looking for a lot of color because you're going to dry out the fill it so just one end turn it back down and stir the other end in lift up your time place it on top of the garlic there lift up your fillet and sit there on top of your garlic butter in take a spoon tilt the pan gently lift up and baste i've got that scented garlic thyme flavor the steak is going gonna cook evenly because it's sat on a little a little bed in the oven for eight to ten minutes [Music] pan on for the relish you think of a steak sandwich you think of a sort of nice heated tomato relish to make the relish finely dice a red onion three finger rule one in front two behind through and chop wow next roughly chop a chilli keeping the seeds in for extra heat start off with the olive oil into a pan onion chilies generous with the olive oil i want a nice sort of rich silky relish from there take your tomatoes you can't just use red tomatoes but these yellow and red make the perfect combination now put your salt in cut that and then roast those tomatoes off take a wooden spoon and just sort of break them up once the skins blister the whole tomato just starts to release all that really nice sweet texture a little teaspoon of cherry vinegar gives that nice acidic balance the sweetness of the tomatoes turn down the gas and just let them sort of stew perfectly now a steak sandwich would not be complete unless it had the most amazing mustard mayonnaise simply add three tablespoons of mayonnaise to three teaspoons of whole grain mustard [Music] now i've got the reddish almost down to like a really nice jam now i want to make that reddish a little bit more fragrant some basil slice it through sprinkle that basil in there beautiful look at this there she is my crown jewels time to take it out smell is incredible just based one more time to fill it touch is quite soft in the center so it's just coming up to mid-rare let it rest at the same time you cooked it it'll be nice and pink evenly throughout the steak to make my sandwich i'm going to char grill some sliced chipatta bread season it nicely just a little drizzle of olive oil i want to get that bread nice and crispy pan nice and hot bread in push it down smell is amazing that char sort of charcoal flavor once you've got those marks on the bread it just stops the bread from becoming soggy and look at this here it is stunning on slice it gently one beautiful slice wow it's nice and pink all the way through and the beef is so soft it's almost like slicing through butter let the knife do the work take a little bit of mayonnaise spread that the back of the spoon on both sides next lettuce take that beautiful slice of beef and then relish on top of that beef and just slice the sandwich in half beautiful now that's what i call a steak sandwich trust me serve the sublime sandwich for brunch and you'll put a smile on everyone's face you

sweet dishes next up my guide to buying chocolate chocolate gives you such an instant hit it's well worth knowing about the good stuff and who better to ask than award winning alchemist of the sweetest kind paul young even when i don't want to think about it i'm thinking about it his cutting-edge approach to chocolate making has won him accolades around the world so when you're not shopping the best way is to look at your chocolate bar look on the back and look at the percentage that gives you how much cocoa is in the bar and the more cocoa the more rich intoxicating flavor so the most exciting bit is tasting chocolate good quality fine chocolate should have that clean snap bite a piece off and crunch it in your teeth but stop chewing let it melt move it around the mouth and you'll find that by letting it melt even dark chocolate that you've had before that seems quite bitter won't be when you chew quickly it releases tannin it releases all the bitterness in the chocolate letting it melt it's smoother and richer and you get all the flavor and most excitingly is it releases something into the brain called dopamine which makes you feel good and that's how you get addicted to real chocolate chocolate is not just an addictive treat it's an amazing ingredient here's my take on which kind to use for what [Music] white chocolate with its sweet vanilla taste it's perfect used as a dipping or pouring sauce with fresh fruit or frozen berries for a quick dessert creamy milk chocolate is great for family friendly puddings and treats like quick bake cakes or melt onto homemade crepes or waffles dark chocolate is rich and intense i like using 70 cocoa stuff use it for ice creams that really pack a punch 100 pure cocoa has a very powerful intense taste and only the real chocolate geeks eat it straight and remember chocolate isn't just for sweet dishes for the famous mexican morally sauce this is the one to grab is there anything better than chocolate they say sex but that's totally overrated my next recipe will be right up your alley malt chocolate doughnuts street food is all about satisfying your cravings these donuts are sweet sticky and absolutely delicious first off we're gonna make the dough now this dough takes a bit of time but it's really exciting i'm heating all of the milk with the sugar this yeast easy to get hold of now when you make fresh doughnuts you need fresh yeast adding some of the warm milk to the yeast will activate it which will help the dough to rise just half give that a quick whisk the sugar is dissolved in the milk the fresh yeast disintegrates instantly set the yeast mixture to one side while it does its job to start the main dough mix i'm adding half the butter to the remaining milk that gives the dough a nice silkiness i want it light so melt the butter into the milk flour into a sieve that helps to make the dough nice and smooth and you know what when you've got a smooth dough it sort of rises evenly add a pinch of salt and two egg yolks pour in the warm milk and melted butter don't start over mixing it when you over mix the dough of the doughnut it gets really tight you're not gonna let it ariel yeast in nice and warm i love that smell now i'm looking for a sort of elasticy texture just dropping off the spoon nice flour the board take the dough out lovely lightly sprinkle a touch more flour and just pull it over and push in every time you're sort of turning it almost like you're turning the dough into itself the dough should just sort of relax and it shouldn't be sticking to your fingers now it's just nice and pliable set that in a nice clean bowl a little sprinkling flour in there so as it starts to rise it doesn't stick cover that with same film leave the dough to rise in a warm place for 60 to 90 minutes until it's doubled in size this stage is called proving now whilst that's proving get a panel for the chocolate filling or ganache pour 500 ml of double cream into a saucepan and add honey [Music] bring the mixture to a gentle boil [Music] traditionally we've always put jam in there but chocolate and donuts wow to die for add the cream i'll give that a good mix the butter elevates the ganache into a really nice shiny chocolate coat look at that whoa give it a really nice whisk the whistling gives it that aerated texture to the ganache you're just lightening the load a little bit nice chocolate filling done put it in the fridge to cool then it's time to gently roll out the dough just let it roll naturally about a centimetre and a half in depth slice one two place them on it's your tray and let them rise again once the donuts have had 30 to 40 minutes to rise it's time to shallow fry them in a pan filled one third full with hot vegetable oil risen but look they're sort of like little pockets of air right here we go place these in nice and carefully four maximum if there's too many in the pan the oil will go cold and the donuts will come out soggy turn them over beautiful we're gonna come out into some sugar mixed with some malt powder 50. how do you tell they're actually cooked in the center tap on top it should be hollow in and just sprinkle the malt and the sugar shake off the excess i get so excited every time i make donuts now look at those beauties these are delicious eating as they are but the ganache is gonna be the icing on the cake piping bag peel the bag over your hand don't forget to pop the nozzle in i want the texture almost like a little liquid inside so i'm going to pipe them with a little bit warm hopefully you've got that burst of magic operation donut lift up the donut squeeze push in and fill just to start seeing that chocolate coming out and sit that back down nice sit them on there they've got a little bit heavier and we all know why nice that one's got my name on it that is amazing [Music] you

If you liked this clip...",2022-12-03 22:16:02.927159, when you think of a burger what you need is a great sauce and a light smoky barbecue goes hand in glove with a great burger start by finely chopping one onion and three cloves of garlic nice hot pan tablespoon of olive oil onions and garlic into the pan nice seasoning salt and pepper now the secret of a good barbecue sauce is that really important caramelization to begin with a nice tablespoon of brown sugar it darkens the onions but it really starts to sort of give that nice syrupy body to the sauce and put a little bit of heat in there now a nice teaspoon of smoked paprika that's the important part of working with spices you've got to cook them out and almost sort of burn off that rawness especially with a smoked paprika that's exactly where i want it to go onions and garlic beautifully caramelized cider vinegar in reduce that down now i've got a fantastic smoky base to complete the sauce i'm making my life really easy and adding pre-made worcester sauce and tomato ketchup cook that out for two to three minutes now depending on how thick you like the barbecue sauce that determines how long you cook it out for i don't want it to be too runny but i don't want it too thick either that's the consistency we're looking for lovely turn down the gas charger seasoning now take that out it's the kind of sauce that i like to have sort of bottled up in the fridge it's great for sandwiches but goes brilliantly well with these sliders homemade smoky barbecue sauce [Music] give the pan a little wipe now start the mix for the sliders to give my mix a really interesting flavor and texture i'm gonna be using unsmoked back bacon i travel all over the world and i spend a lot of time in the states they know how to make a great slider pork sliders beef sliders chicken sliders and it's almost like a way of having a burger but on a much smaller miniature level a little teaspoon of olive oil i want that bacon to get really nice and crispy bacon in this just gives the really nice sort of chunky delicious mix i want texture and pork is perfect for slider [Music] and choppy shallot [Music] shallots are a lot sweeter than your normal white onion fine fine fine and in [Music] now that bacon's getting really nice and crispy i want a bit of heat in there a little teaspoon of smoked paprika in there when you see these sliders in the states for one portion there's like four or five of them little mini one biters incredible now take your pork just open up and give that a really nice seasoning so important you can't season a slider after you've cooked it it's impossible so season it nicely bake it now that's nice and crispy just take a little touch kitchen roll and just drain that off there nice pat that nice and dry i want all that nice sort of crispiness in there beautiful mix all that in take a nice ball and sort of roll it the size of a golf ball get it nice and round first and then three fingers just pat that down don't flatten them too thin otherwise they overcook and they go sort of dry because sliders are bite-sized burgers designed to go in small buns you don't want to make them too big good get the pan nice and hot tablespoon of olive oil when a slider is literally that thick about an inch thick we're going gonna take two and a half to three minutes to each side in turn them over lovely once you've turned them tilt the pan and just spoon all that juice back into them keep my mouth watering now very easy to dry the pork out so just feeling it now your fingers is nice and firm it's a little touch of springiness in the center i'm happy with those add your cheese now so it gets nicely melted i'm using wedgies or smoked cheddar and it has that nice sort of soury smoky creaminess to the slider finally shredded baby gem lettuce just take those buns make sure they're sliced nice and evenly take your lettuce be quite generous with the lettuce just a nice thin slice of tomato take your burgers you see that cheese you feed melted your bbq sauce place the top on and that is my version the slider that is small dynamic but packed full of flavour i'll take that over a hamburger any day [Music] first off get that pan really nice and hot these are sirloin steaks sear it in the pan with all that fat on i'll add flavor salt and pepper couple tablespoons of olive oil in pan nice and hot hold up the steak and lay it in always lay away give the pan a little shake and it stops the steak from sticking we're looking for color and if it sticks it's gonna burn [Music] while the steaks are cooking i can get on with my super quick marinade now two tablespoons of misood paste that's a fermented soybean that gives a really nice sort of rich sweetness tablespoon of sugar a couple of tablespoons rice wine that gives it a really nice vinegary kick a couple of tablespoons of olive oil salt and pepper i'm looking for a nice sort of thick rich marinade marinade done it's time to turn the steaks sort the pan and to give the steak a little base all we're doing every time is just adding more and more flavor take your tongs and sort of lift the steak on its back and really melt all that fat down offer the gas take them out just take your knife it's all that fat there just slice that off i don't want any of that now in to the marinade [Music] beautiful tacos are one of mexico's most popular street foods they've been made from beef pork chicken or fish and are loaded up with amazing sauces and spices now i want something sort of pickly cabbage these are um chinese cabbages slice it in half and look at it really crisp and really tasty we're gonna slice that into quarters and then just shred it and take your time you think of cabbage hair and you think of sort of braised overcooked cabbage nothing worse but at a taco you want freshness a little season chili flakes they sort of discreetly give it a little bit of heat a little touch of rice wine vinegar if you haven't got that fresh lemon juice a small drop of toasted sesame seed oil give that a really good mix now i need something to sort of bring it together we take some wasabi paste very hot very spicy a sort of thumbnail size i'm gonna mix and that couple of tablespoons of mayonnaise and give that a really good mix these are basic corn tortilla the trick is to sort of color them and then shape them actually place it on the gas ring use some tongs so it's not to burn yourself you can also toast your tacos in a frying pan from there i'm just gonna place it on the rolling pin literally 30 seconds as it cools down the great thing about serving tacos is people can fill them themselves just the way they want them cabbage just squeeze out wet marinade a nice rustic little mountain mayonnaise on wait you see how soft and delicious and almost sort of melting in the mouth texture we've got on this amazing sirloin it's look at that really nice sear around the outside it's just nice and pink in the middle start off with my crispy shell back of the spoon with the wasabi mayonnaise inside taco and just sprinkle that delicious pickled cabbage and then just start lining my taco three or four slices touch more on my spicy layer and that is how i'd make the perfect attacker [Music] just open up and drain the tuna into a sieve just lightly flake that don't press it too hard otherwise you'll dry out the tuna now these are water chestnuts just slice them nice and thin you can buy them anywhere any supermarket chestnuts and fresh ginger get rid of that rough skin on the outside by grating the ginger you get to get all that really nice sort of juice in take your spring onions and just slice on an angle i like the texture of the water chestnut with a spring onion or touch of fresh coriander lovely next remove the seeds from a chili to reduce its heat without losing any flavor and finely chop chilies in kaffir lime leaves roll them up nice and tight run your knife down the center once and just chop and that makes the fish cake nice and fragrant touch of salt a touch of pepper fish sauce just lightly season the tuna to bind all those wonderful ingredients two whole eggs and give that a nice little whisk and then add your eggs get your hands in there and start mixing get the mixture roll it and hand the hand into the palm pat them down nicely to cook add a little ground oil to a hot pan at the face of a clock i'm going to go from 12 all the way around first one in these fish cakes only take a few minutes to cook so keeping track of the order they go in the pan means you know which one to turn first [Music] to the pad a nice gentle little shake make sure that nothing's sticking to the bottom spatula two fingers on top turn them over beautiful that crackling noise is something you always want because the tune's already cooked so we're just lightly frying them we get a nice crisp outside and gently take them out smell incredible let them sit there we're gonna make a really nice delicious simple dipping sauce start off a little pinch of sugar fish sauce two tablespoons that gives it the saltiness one tablespoon of rice wine vinegar and some fresh lime juice squeeze all that lime in there your fresh coriander lots of coriander and then give that a little mix and then you have the most amazing spicy tuna fish cakes who would have thought something as delicious as that can come out of a can a simple supper in minutes that's so mouth-wateringly easy and delicious you're guaranteed to cook it again and again you

that happens right big watch me you've really got to watch me now yeah [Music] center of the plate again stay nice and tidy yes so easy time for the main course a delicious sea bass in sorrel sauce [Music] sea vess for me absolute delicacy the flavor not just of the flesh but the skin is extraordinary fill it come down the backbone nice long strokes every time i fill it a sea bass it's a certified pleasure because they're extraordinary fish look at it absolutely beautiful three nice portions score and skin and the beauty of this fish is that it's so robust but so delicate in flavor sauce lava butter shallots salt pepper spread down the shallots with no colour that's absolutely crucial verma sea bass is very sweet and rich so therefore we need a really nice dry white wine to find that balance reduce fish stock in reduce cream in bring it back up to a boil sieve sorrel the flavor it gives to the fish sauce is extraordinary it's peppery a little bit like rocket it also has this really nice acidic tanginess to it into the cream just to infuse lovely hot pan olive oil season the bass salt pepper just before the olive oil starts to smoke sea bass in skin side down [Applause] turn it over i just faced over the bass keeps our skin really nice and crispy broccoli cooking for about two and a half minutes maximum drain still got a really nice dark green color see that's out

[ __ ] turned have we got any sea bass left because iron man right come around here yeah he's burnt three pants full now you've burnt it we started with 75 portions of bass we've got half the dining room not served yet we [ __ ] so many baths so early we've run out i'm going to it some more baths but when i fill up these bags when we get them can we [ __ ] cook them properly richard yeah chef yes hello quintus here listen to me on top of 75 just under 100 portions of bass hello don't [ __ ] it i know you're not a professional chef you know that but you are a [ __ ] bright spark and all i beg for for one hour is just a little bit of [ __ ] intelligence i'm sorry sorry chef did you enjoy your minecraft makos was good yes you sound french yeah i'm french it's not like raymond blanc banging on about how [ __ ] our british food is again did you enjoy your bath i enjoyed my bus but yeah where the sea bus was probably cool sorry i'm just nodding off two seconds did you enjoy your bath not as much as the sausage could you put your tongue out for me please got a [ __ ] ball bearing on the end of it would you expect me to take your pilot seriously when you've got all that shrapnel in there jump right twist please wait chef what do they say jb yeah far too long far too long that's the main campaign big big problem on this one steve that first table you cooked four times yeah what were the results how many customers out of 50 want to pay for their dinner uh 21 unknown thing 21 yeah why far too long to receive the main course and as well some of them find it exactly bland it's a line caught sea bass yeah roasted in olive oil it's the best quality [ __ ] sea bass 21 customers refusing to pay for the main course i don't know why you keep on laughing i think you find it a joke don't you let's get our priorities right yeah yeah [ __ ] the stupid [ __ ] laughing snickering hey because it's not you looking good right now yeah i'm good if you give me those vibes i'm gonna tell you you got those vibes whether you don't mean it inside i just wanted to come back this is important for me as it is for you yeah so when you're finishing on a high yeah okay are you ready yeah let's see clear down let's get ready for dessert yes next on the menu foodie gobshite janet street porter is back in my kitchen this is fish stew fish stew well whatever you [ __ ] want to call it golden and i'll find out what taxi drivers really think of me you want his cab [ __ ] off welcome back to the f word now genesee porter last year beat me in a challenge only because we had a [ __ ] panel of blind tasters that were so crap taste and distinction obsessed with low-fat food so i lost the challenge she's back for more and this time she's got [ __ ] no chance right the rules are simple the challenger picks their best dish and i have to try and beat that with my version the winner is the nets oh no sarah the winner for today is yes this time i'm determined to win um so don't tell me a low-fat soup this is fish stew well whatever you [ __ ] want to call it golden right the thing about making this yes is that you make the fish stock uh the day before which you get the fish manga to cut the fish into phillips and remove all the bones so you just got to get a carrier bag full of bones right it sounds a bit cheffy though you know that golden it's practical so you make the fish stop the day before by using uh onions you sweat onions celery maybe a bit of carrot lots of herbs thyme and so on in a massive pan the biggest pan you possibly can right and some white wine are you agreeing with this sauce in the background i'm listening but not getting very excited janet's making a fish too and i'm doing something sort of almost like a little classic bully base but a very quick bullier base because we haven't got time to do a long-winded three and a half four hour classic french bully bay so it's a very simple fish stew but then with red mullet fennel carrots shallots a touch of white wine but the secret ingredient today of course is the perno and that goes brilliantly with a fish just like the good old days we used to have the burner on black you got no idea the hard time i got after losing against the challenge you last time you know that what happened did you get your leg pulled down apart i mean no just in the kitchen they're saying [ __ ] you now chef you lost to janet street porter you're beaten by a woman who will not put up with fancy food things in piles unnecessary sauces do you know on the last challenge i actually let you win you know that gordon bollocks you tried your hardest oh my stop falling over janet you're right my dolly yeah i just had a slight disaster it's all right okay fish straight in and i mean really straight in guts have been taken out and straight in look at that then with the pans i'm gonna do now is just glaze the pan with a touch of purno and white wine what i'm gonna do so get all that flavor from the bottom of the pan is look wash out the pan in she goes and then in there again nice [Music] i don't know if you've got fish heads there or prawn heads can i have them i'm going to put them in my soup no i'm not giving them to you no you shellfish [ __ ] right that's [ __ ] out of order i'm sorry because you asked me for my head and i have not shot these vegetables as fine as i would have done because if i wasn't being finished filmed on [ __ ] national television i would have whacked them all in the blender and that's a bit of a top tip for all the [ __ ] at home yes we can't chop as small as you know supersonic golden i'm now putting my fish in okay good how do fish take the cook well i'm going to put in first the scallops because they're the thickest i unlike these recipes you know that this is such a simple recipe i think putting the saffron in is key because the saffron colors the potatoes they look fantastic yeah so i'm going to put my little bits of fish in a pan and unlike janet i'm gonna cook them separately okay because they cook very very quickly because they're small little bits of fish are you in favor of my cookbook msc what to make people send in useless cookbooks yeah unwanted cookbooks the sad thing is and you you've said a lot about this that people in britain buy cookery books but don't cook it's like porn they just go to bed every night instead of having a shag they read a cookery book they cook it i call it cookery pool they cook they cook they cook for my chocolate i hope it doesn't go on in your household so what do you have sex or do you read cookery books i would do both treat it like a dinner in between courses read right janet yes darling this is looking fantastic yeah start getting nervous please yes how are you doing i'm doing fine i can't i'm just doing a bit of sieving do you panic when things go pear-shaped at dinner parties in terms of when you're in dinner parties i worked too hard do you give dinner parties do i [ __ ] you can't charge them they come home can you i don't give them parties i call on a sparrow moment and say i'm cooking chicken pie want to come round i'm cooking fish jar week on saturday hold on not chicken pie with pastry janet surely well people the gays and calorie watchers don't eat the pastry gays don't eat pastry you're having a laugh aren't you i've got lots of friends that are going they love pastry why they're fat guys janet looks a nice color it tastes great does it be scared be scared be very scared you think i'm gonna lose yeah two challenges on the track you got another thing coming right six is almost ready gonna leave them both to simmer now between eight and ten minutes and then later on janet loses [Music] crispy doughnuts yeah so it's a nice yeast batter yeah now the most important thing with these yeah is just keep them submerged under the oil yeah out into the sugar so with a donut we're gonna serve a really nice slice of apple fritter yes yeah okay yeah in there like that off and in yeah okay right watch fresh yogurt yeah maple syrup and that's a really nice fine apple puree in there yeah look out with your fritter again out get it dry yeah and look i slice

dinner on the table i've never been able to take that in out to cook i've always ate the dinner i'm not worried about where it came from or whatever anything can cook it's a sandwich a hot cross farm

summer it's gonna take a lot to get this lightly laid out the dark ages and comfortable in the kitchen looking for the dish that's got nine or ten uses start off with a shepherd's pie lovely but the most important thing about that is the mints are making a really nice savory mince lovely because on the back of that once it's been used for a shepherd's pie you can just evolve it spaghetti yeah then you've got um you know lasagna curried mince with some seasoning do you have two on the stove um i'll do it yeah i love guy this is what i might say exactly johnny i am known for all of this

buckles oh [ __ ] you've got mints on your gold bars beef stock and worcester sauce then turn down the heat to simmer special time with the kids at the weekend yeah yeah this can be frozen and that's a way of sort of just getting organized yep oh [ __ ] the [ __ ] hell aren't there new tiles you guys just put down yeah so are they legit can we stand on them without food do we get done for standing on solid goods she's making me out of right dodgy character i thought all cabbies are dodging back into the pan and back onto the stove jolly please yeah we'll do and you know what as well go on

recipe challenge you know what honey yes no it's very close to score three two two and it's the end of a very very long night i felt there's a big [ __ ] monkey on my back this evening because [ __ ] me was i doing a lot welcome back i can't wait to see janet street paula's face when she loses this challenge john baptist you'll taste that taste what a real fish soup should taste like not your finger janet [ __ ] know where that's been you just put your finger in my soup that's all right hurry up yeah and put madame porter out of her [ __ ] misery please yes okay let's go yeah hello guys how are you do you want to see really delicate flavors it's not the best fish it's got a lot of chili in it i like the spice okay where's that lazy frog okay it wasn't difficult yeah what was a very classic quick pull your bass what are they saying no no i just said it it's too [ __ ] hot janet it's forgotten i love you no yeah the preference it was delicious it was meaty full-bodied bit like me bit like your [ __ ] butlers give me kiss now get out oh yes [Music] right now time for some posh totty trini and susanna okay the pigs have been here a week now they take a lot of looking after but the kids are really rising to the challenge our duties who's gonna clean up the poo really okay there you go oh look jack come here look at his little ear look she's cut quite badly on the rear see the top of the rear what they're doing is they're catching the clip on the fence so when she's scratching her ears that clip on the back of her ear is pulling so it's bleeding kevin hi gordon so called in christine and kevin to get some advice the breeders who have bought the pigs from last week we brought you a little prezi for them thank you what is it it's a bit of a treat this hollow tree stump should satisfy the pig's natural desire for a good old scratch i want to talk to christian about their ears look because see the blood where they've been catching if we don't clean it up it's going to get infected so you've done a really good job in spotting that so we just clean it up with some cotton wool some warm salted water which will make them squeal but at least it will have the antiseptic effect and these little piggies squealed all the way home [Music] it may sound harsh but it really is in the pig's best interest they definitely won't bite no no no no pigs squeal i mean they squeal as if they're being murdered and they fight i mean they don't want to be turned upside down on their bottom so even though it's it's not actually that much of a discomfort for them uh they don't want to be there cool they don't like there is being clean do they i think we should give them a little treat now with an apple or something don't you corn jack feed them nicely one each the pigs certainly let you know when they're in any discomfort so i'm going to make sure these girls live a life of luxury hey ready yeah let's go guys please yes just take them off us richard james i should be there and you should be here yeah i saw the first [ __ ] pan of donuts charcoal yeah send the [ __ ] place yes i'm seriously unhappy with that because out of those 50 customers you managed to cook for one table but when i saw the way they were overcooked from the beginning there's no way on earth you guys are ready to step up and [ __ ] cook donuts you cook one table out there i hope the [ __ ] okay they're paying for them well that was a bit of a letdown okay yeah and thanks for calling me chef that's all i wanted from the out thank you very much clear down it was crispy and sugary and it was everything i wanted a dessert appearance wise i wasn't that impressed kind of looked like two brown balls just stuck there so i prodded it and then nice kind of the apples kind of came drooling out sort of thing and i thought oh this looks interesting i love the pudding but i don't think it does make up for the fact that we did wait for such a long time for our mayo that was a tough call okay gordon okay feedback for the donuts please they are quite disappointed about the waiting time few people think that the donut is a bit greasy that was a donut so they're supposed to be cooked in [ __ ] fat how many customers are gonna pay for their doughnuts okay we're having 12 none per year for the for the bonus there's a fresh apple compote injected into the donut before they went to the table let's start off with the starters the seller of tuna yeah brilliant well done all 50 customers agreed to pay for that [ __ ] starter the negative side we wasted a lot yeah the positive side they all paid for it the sea bass 21 customers refuse to pay for it a lot of waste a long way and there's a 12 refuse to pay so the total well done 117 dishes paid for yeah more importantly you [ __ ] hung in there yes the challenge was for you guys to cook for every [ __ ] table and make sure those customers paid i felt there's a big [ __ ] monkey on my back this evening because [ __ ] me was i doing a lot i think you could see that richard would you open your own restaurant now yeah a piece of pizza well done can we get a drink now can you get a drink cool [ __ ] essex boys yeah now [ __ ] off and get a drink i think [ __ ] i wasn't born in essex you

This easy to make sauce will make you the BBQ king or queen...",2022-12-03 22:16:02.927159, hey guys this is ben from lucky cat we are here and we are going to show you how to make an amazing barbecue sauce it's going to be something you can use with chicken you can use it with fish we're going to do a pork rib dish it also works really well with game especially now starting with the game season so let's get to the sauce our main ingredient for the sauce or the hero is cumin so we've got some roasted cumin seeds which is just ground down and we've got some roasted black peppercorns so we're going to just put them into the present water and just give it another quick bash just to break them down a little bit more super important to toast your seeds before or spices before you grind them because it releases a lot of the oil softens them up a little bit makes them more easy to break down it's going to go it looks like quite a lot but it's going to be fine then to that we're going to add the rest of the ingredients we've got some dried korean chili flakes we've got some vanilla sugar there's some like awesome soft brown sugar if you haven't got that um worcestershire sauce very hard to say worcestershire sauce uh we've got some ketchup which we make right now at the end of the summer with some beautiful tomatoes cider vinegar so it's going to be nice and sharp we've got sweet sour spicy thing going on two more ingredients are this is our smoked sriracha sauce which we've made with our friends over at eaton alive down in south london so you can use normal sriracha if you haven't got the smoked or you're not got that available to you and the secret ingredient is this looks a bit gross but it is a combo extract so like kombudaki so it's quite a quite a niche ingredient but if you can get it it works super well it just adds a really delicious flavor to the sauce so we're going to do is just give it a really good mix and then we're going to pop it onto the fire and bring it up to the boil and we're just going to simmer it for about about 10 or 15 minutes just so that it thickens up slightly you don't want it too thick so you don't want it to be like ketchup um but you want to have it just so you can start to glaze lacquer up the meat or fish that you're cooking so we'll just pop that on the stove now and that's it and then we're going to leave it there for about 10 minutes let it come to the simmer for about 15 and then we're ready to go [Music] okay so that's our sauce so basically we just brought it to the boil um you need to get brains into the boil so everything kind of comes together and as a rolling boil starts everything starts to emulsify together so you've got all those different liquids and sugars and spices in there you want it all to become like a beautiful uh if you look now you see it's a really nice shiny glaze it's quite nice and thick as well so what we've done is we're just roasting these pork ribs over the barbecue we smoked them as well but if you haven't got a smoker it's completely fine um we're just roasting and basically rendering out all the fat crisping up the meat slightly and then we're just gonna keep basting this beautiful sauce [Music] so we're just gonna finish on the grill plenty of glaze so if you're going to cook a chicken for example you wouldn't pre-cook the chicken and reheat it you'd have it um just nicely slowly going over the fire slowly over the grill that's why it works really nicely with game birds so quail we're going gonna do it with grouse soon as we get the first grouse in just really gently grilled and they cook quite quickly so that's kind of what we're looking for so while it's cooking really really important just keep basting it and basically i'm basing it if you see any like barbecue guys from america they normally have a mop and a bucket and that's how much sauce they're putting on so they're just basting on there basically when they're basting on this it's just the meat the fats coming out of the meat and then the replacement of the fat the sauce is going in there it's gonna be really sticky and beautiful and delicious so you can see we've got that beautiful char color all that sugar and all that caramel is just sticking onto the ribs now we're just going to give it one final glaze right now and then we're going to hit it now with some loads of roasted spices so now we're just going to finish it with some roasted spices so in here i've got a lucky sashimi pepper so a mix of seven spices chili coriander seeds and ground shiso and then we also put some tomatoes dehydrated tomato powders in there as well and some sesame seeds so it gives it a really beautiful flavor and then we've got the spices that we used for the sauce we've got some toasted cumin we've got some roasted coriander seeds and then we've also got a little bit more of the chili and black pepper and white peppercorns that's going to go on top and then we basically just serve a dish straight onto a nice clean tray and then we serve it with a little bit more of the barbecue sauce and we serve it with lime and that is our cumin spiced barbecue ribs [Music] you

corn in so now get your lid never leave it far away from you sounds like it's raining it's not so it's popcorn canals trying to pop out boom delicious just a little shake of the pan get it going and then lift that lid at your apparel we see it's a very exciting pan in there and when all that little pitter patter stops you know your popcorn is cooked nice you could eat it fresh from the pan but i've got another plan i'm gonna make a salted caramel popcorn start off with your sugar into the hot pan never stir a caramel otherwise it crystallizes it's a salted caramel so a nice pinch of salt in there as well now once you've got it to a really nice dark caramel flavor stir in your butter very carefully caramel is very very hot half a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda kickstarts the reaction that gives the caramel a honeycomb flavor mix that in you'll see it reacting almost like a large crunchy in the bottom of your bowl now the gas is off and that camera has a nice dark rich flavor now pour in the popcorn to coat it with that incredible caramel give that a good mix it's that easy and it's gonna taste amazing lay that nice and flat once that cools down it becomes nice and brittle we've got that nice salted caramel flavor which just takes popcorn to a complete dim level whilst the popcorn cools down it's onto my prawn tostada wonderful prawns i'm gonna marinate them first with a little bit of garlic nice and fine and don't worry if you can't slice thinly just get a little crater and grate the garlic nice and fine as well nice pinch of chili flakes over your prawn garlic in salt pepper and olive oil give that a really nice little mix whilst the prawns marinade i'm gonna knock up a salad this is a really nice sort of light fragrant salad radishes topped and tailed and then into quarters cherry tomatoes halved spring onions sliced and seasoned and then just to liven things up a little bit of chili in there and slice them on an angle now the avocado cut in half give that a little twist so you just go down and down and down carefully with your knife turn it around go down and down and down and then you take your spoon and you've got your diced avocado coming out already now baby gem lettuce half then shred freshly squeezed lime juice and a little drizzle of olive oil tostada is a classic mexican style open tortilla so that lime complements it beautifully lastly roughly chopped coriander and give it a mix that is the perfect base for our tostada the salad's ready now for the prawns and don't be afraid of getting the pan nice and hot teaspoon of olive oil in anything less than that sizzle when you put that first prawn in there don't put them in keep them nice and flat make sure you've got all that marinade in there as well watch them change color rapidly i'd rather cook them quicker in a hotter pan and slower in a colder pan the difference in taste is night and day the prawns will take just two minutes to cook through lime juice just over the top nice toss them over the lime these are corn tortilla quite robust and it's a kind of base that doesn't disintegrate hot pan in it's a dry pan so that corn tortilla goes nice and crispy on the outside [Music] look crispy shell to build them generous with the salad that base will stay nice and crisp next with your prawns i like to keep the tails in to the center and lay the round part of the prawn on the outside and there we have a delicious yeah very humble prawn tostada followed by my superb salty caramel popcorn beautiful [Music] prawn tostadas and salty caramel popcorn vibrant irresistible smelling dishes you'll want to dive into big and bold i was living in france i stayed there for three years once twice a week i treated myself to the most amazing bold breakfast and it started off with these beauties here murgays cheap but incredibly tasty start off with a nice hot pan mug is in it's a very spicy sausage doesn't need any help doesn't even need chili just a touch of salt and pepper you can smell the spice they're starting to release all that wonderful oil that flavor in there add a couple of cloves i'll finely slice garlic spread the garlic across the pan it instantly changes color takes on this nice dark rich golden color now take a look with the heat out with the parsley the stalks of soft herbs like parsley and coriander can be used to impart flavour during cooking but the leaves should always be added just before serving to give maximum colour and fragrance [Music] and then finish that off with my capers amazing all right beautiful now take your quests on they're literally 24 hours old so they're crispy on the outside and just slice off the lid this recipe is a great way to use up any leftover croissants from the day before i used to cringe when i saw the french cooks throw away croissants i used to cry thinking oh my god any idea what you're throwing away in terms of flavor whatever you do do not wipe out that pan dunk your croissants mopping up all that amazing flavor and caramelizing the inside for that beautiful and don't forget the lids and then get your thumbs and go inside the croissant all i want to do now is just create a little pocket and just manipulate the crescent now this is where it gets exciting mix up the capers the garlic and sausages look at the color of that wonderful delicious flavored oil now some cheese but not just any cheese fontina cheese is like the number one cheese for grilling and because it's a very rich cheese you shave it thinner than you would a white truffle but it gives a really nice saltiness and a light smoky flavour salt place these big boys on the tray literally 30 seconds on the grill here we go nice crisp packed full of flavor now top them and that for me it's almost like being back in paris except this time i don't have to share them with the french my ultimate big and bold breakfast murgies and fontina stuffed croissants a great way to start the day [Music] jack hi my gonna help with some pickling please oh definitely no you love pickles right love pickles um favorite pickle what is it i like pickled onions we're going to do pickled celery mm-hmm it's a nice little snack and great for plum ones great for salads first thing we need to pick the celery for me so you see where the next one's going to be it's in there yeah okay i'll figure it out but i'm hungry today is this all we're having for dinner jack come on i wouldn't do that to you you know that there's more coming now because we're pickling it we want to sort of make it look a little bit more attractive so we go around like that okay on an angle so when you pick all the food does it does it preserve it it's exactly what it does but also gives it a really nice salty soury flavour yeah okay now splash of water and then with the sugar nice okay so gotta bring that up to the bowl and sort of create almost like a little syrup yeah okay little teaspoon of peppercorns in mustard seeds in quite generous on the mustard seeds that gives a bit of sort of spice now those you must know cloves excellent cloves in now touch of salt no okay so from there white wine vinegar now in order for all that to actually pickle you need to boil it so by boiling it okay it brings all the ingredients together it fuses all the spices and helps cook the celery have a little taste nice nice see i put some hairs on your chest yes it will look boom it's working already now see nice wine vinegar right celery's ready yeah okay let's walk to the ball now turn that off now from there start placing the celery into that jar so when you pick other foods can you use that same recipe exactly that 100 once it's pickled it doesn't really go off mm-hmm okay now put them in there so can we eat this straight away when it's in here do you know what as soon as it's cooled down you can definitely eat that straight away i can't wait to dig into it at dinner are they delicious yes we'll leave that to cool down our pickles are ready and cooling now to marinate the chicken when you fried chicken traditionally it's always gonna be done with the dark meat the brown meat so you've got that nice sort of uh drum here and this bit that thigh cooking on the bone as well keeps it even more moist so first things first salt pepper please from there famous buttermilk buttermilk in it's brilliant for marinating the chicken if you can put this buttermilk over your chicken the night before the more it tenderizes the chicken and starts to sort of really relax the chicken and puts a really nice sort of creamy soury flavor in there so might stick that in the fridge for us please and we'll start the dolce de leche biscuits nice the argentinians call these shortbreads alfa jorge and they're the favorite sweet treat on the streets of buenos aires they're light crumbly shortbread biscuits sandwiched with gloriously golden caramel dolce de leche sauce for the shortbread beat together softened butter granulated sugar and beat until light and fluffy add one egg [Music] slice vanilla pots scrape out the seeds add to the mix and beat again plain flour corn flour and baking powder then fold the mixture together using floured hands roll into small balls flatten into discs and place on a baking tray [Music] chill for 10 minutes until firm to touch then simply bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until pale golden once cooled sandwich two biscuits together with a caramelly dolce de leche sauce [Music] finish with a dusting of icing sugar [Music] delicious my dessert and pickles are ready the buttermilk should have worked its magic on the chicken all that's left is to fry it now we're gonna roll the chicken out of the buttermilk into the flour so that's why it gets nice and crispy and blistery on the outside okay cool so what we've got to make sure because the flour is the last coat yes this is nicely seasoned yeah okay so salt and pepper in there nice and this is smoked paprika so that gives it a little bit of sort of uh maybelline yeah yeah spice that's right a little bit of heat and this one my favorites what's that cayenne pepper that's right again slightly spicy but the heat works brilliantly well garlic powder traditionally are used a lot in the steaks onion powder garlic powder just run your fingers through that please cool i'm gonna get the pan on now two centimetres of oil this is a really good mix for fish as well mm-hmm goujons fighting a nice spicy texture helps fish so first thing is we just shake off some of the buttermilk lay that down yes okay really important to get them covered completely okay in the flour yeah okay so i love fried chicken do you now lift that up there first one and you place it in there away from you off you go nice and gently good and lay away good if any stage you think the oil is getting too hot yeah just add a touch of cold oil in there or turn off the gas good gently fry the chicken for 25 to 30 minutes or until cooked through now very
