### Instagram Scraping

### Part 1: Getting acquainted
- Mess around with some API wrapped such as InstaLoader (I have some sample code in the examples\scraping folder)
- Look through documentation and examples on scraping Instagram with Python and try some different methods and APIs - try and find one that will work the best for our purposes
- Explore some basic parameters and mess around with what data can be queried. We'll want to be able to scrape things by hashtag, as that will allow us to zoom in on specific dishes or recipes

### Part 2: Getting the data we want

- Figure out how to scrape Instagram to get some data that might be interesting for us to study
- Develop a robust and extendable pipeline that allows us to query mass amounts of data and tweak parameters
- Make sure that this pipeline gets the data and writes it to a csv or json in a scalable manner so we can get mass amounts of data that we can then easily read in
- Write up any concerns, limitations, or notes that may be useful that you come across on the journey
