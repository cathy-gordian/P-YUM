 you really think America is the only one with the grilled cheese there happens to be a contender so we're going to find out if there's a winner so today we are making an American Girl cheese versus a French grilled cheese just kind of the exact same thing but they just call it a different word maybe they're slightly different preparation let us know in the comments but there's also many other versions  very basic American version here's the key was too fast or too slow whatever roughly about a minute or slightly longer so you have a nice deep toast with a good crunch and obviously the cheese needs to look like this when he got into it because Pat ride there and cows come home it's obviously a regular other slice of American cheese Vince Camuto / 240 ML of whole milk during constantly until Begins the second cut off the heat and stir in one cover 80 g of grated gruyere cheese snow once it's completely melted and you have a glossy sauce play the same as a classic choice of this year but you're not just doing this to sound fancy and finally I'm going to spread on more emmental cheese boiler for 1 to 2 minutes or until the cheese is melted bubbling and lightly charred that is a croque-monsieur if I've ever seen one it's not bad either this is the power of nostalgia I can eat both of these and say what I picked this one probably because I want like a little bit more of an experience experience but this one back to your childhood it's still good in the fact I can even be in the same ring as this is something special
