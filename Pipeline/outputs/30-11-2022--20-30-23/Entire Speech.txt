 I'm going to h e double hockey sticks for this one but I made a crust pie it's pastry crust on the bottom with graham cracker crust on top and Oreo crumbs just enough cold water to bring this together into a Shaggy do the reason he needs to be cold as you don't want to melt the butter if the butter melts you get a totally homogeneous picture that isn't crumbly or flakey or anything like that it should look like you didn't quite enough water throw that in the fridge for a half-hour let all the particles hydrate we should be perfect we will my binder that will go between the crust dark corn you can use golden syrup or honey the dark syrup has an iced caramel flavor look up 150 grams or so and then another half a cup of plain granulated sugar 100 the mixture of crystallized sucrose with other syrups gets you a thick yet soft texture at least when baked with eggs two eggs a good splash of vanilla smooth this is basically pecan pie filling it's missing butter but we're going to have plenty Austin the middle it's three pie crust stacked on top of each other with a sweet Vine butter elsewhere half a stick like 60 G of butter melted that to bind our crumb crust starting with Oreos one of these big sleeves which is 1234 that is 16 Oreos or thereabouts maybe 200 was Max in a bag and then Hulk smash you can do this in a food processor but Hulk smash this is my rolling pin by the way they blunt instruments for an in precise job when I need a Precision instrument I turn to Harry sponsor of this I use fine German steel in the kitchen and when I shave gave a little will check out the new two-tone handle design with deeper grooves better grip half of that plastic is recycled by the way love the shave gel with the feels great in this new obnoxious smell now for some Precision beard maintenance between them I will surrender myself to the authorities but first here's the recipe standard deflections will help me negotiate these Corners the thing about my beard is it gross play slowly and when there's not much there for a bad razor to grab onto you just get terrible skinny station I dealt with that my whole life until I found Harry's their 5-blade razors are just

I'll put maybe a third of this butter in with the cookie crumbs and then toss like you do for any crumb crust you want just enough butter so that doesn't immediately shortcrust pastry a stick of cold butter 113g that's one part by weight when you clench it like that that's good enough done a little flower on the counter and we can roll out our children stood pastry dough it's always hardest at the beginning just give me do rolls turn and repeat turning helps you roll more evenly and it keeps the body the pastry from sticking to the counter very gradually I'll start to flatten out without but if it cracks a little that's fine the harder a shortcrust pastry is to work it's going to taste the heterogeneous distribution has Butter creates fault lines little crumbly doesn't have to be super thin what is that like to have a centimeter wide enough to cover pie pan Which all greased up with my butter over here that'll make the pie really easy to get later later pastry in go around the edge of breaking off any excess and being sure patch any holes holes would let that corn syrup mixture seep through to the pan surface now two parts dry ingredients by weight almost entirely flower normal.alt we're at Woodburn or stick pour in a thin layer of sand mixture it just tastes great binds all the layers together for your Chrome layer in and then I'll compress it a little like would Freddie crumb crust just don't shoot moose the pastry underneath now to minimize both color pollution and waste I'll turn this bag inside out and throw into packages of graham crackers about 250g smashy smash that shock on the outside of the bag so my colors are staying separate the rest of my melted butter goes with a pinch of salt if it's unsalted butter and you can throw in some cinnamon if you want good if it seems like you don't have quite enough butter to buying this into a crust too much but it'll be two solid wants baked give that syrup an egg mixture another stir except it's it's been pouring another layer on top of the chocolate followed by all of is flour and then like a spoonful or two of sugar we have plenty more sweetness coming graham cracker crumbs again I'll Pat that flats and then pour over my remaining syrup topple shiny cover in aluminum foil that'll trap heat and get you even cook across all those layers and bake at 350 Fahrenheit 180 c will check back in in 45 minutes which is now time to remove the foil and bake it again how long depends on your oven and the dimensions of the pant this is a narrow deep which means it's going to take a little bit extra time see how the center Jiggles in their baked this kill everything is brown and that jiggling pretty much stops which was another 45 minutes if you want a gooey texture bacon a little less I like it super chewy let it cool rabbits and then it's solid enough that you can just turn it out like that slice carefully because pastries supercombo e as it should be and there you go there's your sliced if your pinch or two of salt if you're using unsalted butter and then I'll just hack at it you can do this across the person than I am you can moisten things up with some whipped cream on top Super not that easy to cut through with a fork ohyeah h e double hockey sticks giant chewy chocolate Golden Graham you know it's solid enough that you can just pick up the peace that's the way to do it do it in moderation  food processor you can do with a pastry cutter but you can also just smack it around with a knife cutting the butter until it almost disappears in there I'll make a little well and then start
