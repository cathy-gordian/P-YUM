 you really think America is the only one with the grilled cheese there happens to be a contender so we're going to find out if there's  Menards just to give us a little leverage right the grilled cheese with him that I have a cheese talk about that later very basic American version we should have better get the edge to edge choice if you want to go traditional American never going to use obviously usually I prefer my grilled cheese to have more flavor but there is a special Nostalgia to using America  what are the other side of the bread so it's decided it's been toasting is a nice golden here's the key is too fast or too slow about a minute or slightly longer you have a nice deep toast with a good French and obviously the cheese  you look like this when he got into it because I tried there like you slap your need to the Gap man cows come home another we have better the way it's obviously not fair to put a regular grilled cheese it gets to grilled cheese that also has ham American girl boy representative pepper jack cheese slices of ham one slice of American cheese other slice of American cheese it's about one minute flip on the other side of the bread is beautifully golden brown we slice that bad boy in half what happens Angels Sing Annunciation first off topping 14 G of unsalted butter all-purpose flour together and let that cook for about a minute so today we are making Vince Camuto / 240 ML of whole milk the second cut off the heat and stir in one cup of 80 g of grated gruyere cheese it's completely melted and you have a glossy sauceda takes result in Pepper in an optional touch fresh grated nutmeg quality country sourdough of some sort Emily got to that but I keep a good local bakery will get your ass on over there and support a local business  play the same as a classic choice of this year but you're not just doing this to sound fancy I'm going to spread on more boy new a pants over medium golden brown rust breads exposed bare bottom flip and repeat American Grilled Cheese versus a French grilled cheese just slightly just make sure we got cheese without burning your just beautifully to the top with your Mornay sauce emmental cheese boiler for 1 to 2 minutes or until the cheese is melted bubbling and ever so lightly charred that is a croque-monsieur if I've Uber Wednesday which is so much bigger listen are you trying to tell me that size Matters Stuffy's and decide our winner licking them in cheese but I mean it looks good. it's not bad either this is the power of nostalgia what I pick this one over the other one probably because I want like a little bit more of an experience usually grilled cheese across the whole spectrum of the world right there's a cheese toastie in England I close my eyes experience the ham get that crispy crust on top deeply flavored Jesus and then of course this incredible bread so this is a full-on experience but this one back to your childhood it's still good in the fact I can even be in the same room this is something special special b-roll     just kind of the exact same thing but they just call it a different word maybe they're slightly different preparation  so many other versions it's just a different vessel of starch Harrison is Rockville shoe it does use ham that's kind of an unfair Advantage so
