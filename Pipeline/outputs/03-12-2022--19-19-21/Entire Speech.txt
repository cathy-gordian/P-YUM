 this recipe is sponsored by Squarespace so my mom make these awesome caramel brown is in 4 years after I left home she would bake them whenever I came back around and she remember box cake would be fine as long as it's chocolate pour it in here no worries going to make brown not cake brownies are chocolate cake butt with proportionally more fat and less water so they're too heavy to rise to get rid of will be 3/4 of a stick of softened butter 85g and what little water be using comes from a third of a cup of evaporated milk save that can will use more 1/3 of a cup is like 80 Mills this is the same thing as sweetened condensed milk but with no added sugar make sure use evaporated and not sweetened condensed otherwise I'll be way too sweet we are going to stir all this together totally do this without an electric mixer but it'll be a bit of effort to keep this from being cake we have to majorly restrict them for Content there aren't even any eggs in there so when it finally starts to come together it's going to be I like them refrigerated so they're extra chewy like pull the fillings out of your teeth level really thick looks like clay and that's probably that's it for the next thing everything else is going to get Laird in the oven but we didn't so we'll do it now we're going to say something but I figured oven at 350 Fahrenheit 180 C another third cup a tea Mills of evaporated milk goes into those caramels in a heat-safe cousin microwave for like a minute and then check on it when you get it just hot but it'll melt into a thick caramel sauce you won't know if you're there until you start stirring and spreading the heat around you do this in a pot over low heat on the stove fine but just barely melted either way if it gets too hot you could kind of seized up raven bird y'all so when I get a cup of chopped nuts ready maybe 150g those are chewy to make them chewy you got to get yourself 1 lb 454 G of use anything back to the chocolatey do so now we're going to do is work take half of this mixture for your fingers spread it over the pan just a little dollops all over this 9 by 13 inch cake pan it could be any size in that neighborhood and then you actually pre-bake those bits for like 5 minutes until they look like little cookies I know it's weird but go with it sprinkle 6 oz of chocolate chips Depakote 470 G darker chocolate would probably work better here everything else or super sweet sprinkle on that cup of chopped nuts making sure you get the edges the corners and then we're going to pour a caramel for that lovely stuff but if you over bake it it goes past 2 caramel candies and unwrap every single one of them Indie come straight concrete that's why we had to pre-bake the bottom layer of the cake mixture you got to give that a head start so it'll be done by the time the caramel is done take the remaining do and distribute that over-the-top don't forget to put Robin Each corner is so thick that it's going to barely spread in the oven so you get into the corners yourself but it's good that it won't spread that means that after it bakes you'll awesome surface that steak and some surface that's caramel heterogeneity 18 minutes 18 minutes in my mom's oven at least every other things different pull it out when it still looks a little underdone like that it should be very soft hot as it cools that caramel is going to firm up a tons you got to account for that what is cool down on the counter the same night we baked it still has a bit of a gooey Vibe if you're into this will take a while for small hands which is my niece's health personally I am not I like it the next day refrigerated now it's so occupies a liminal space between Cake and Candy you know I talk a lot about my Italian-American Heritage on this channel but this desert speaks to my waspy heritage my mom this is what I think of in Ohio recipe having grown up Ohio if it's quick it's easy it's tasty and it contains some kind of embarrassing shortcut personally I don't think any shortcuts are embarrassing if they get you where you're trying to go I mean you call Squarespace a shortcut but what's embarrassing about having somebody else do hardest parts of building and running your website I think that's totally fine you're not in website building business you're in the business of whatever business you're in good thing to it used to be my job I can't emphasize enough you got to do this with soft airspace has everything you need to sell anything your products your content your time if you're a stylist or a lawyer or a therapist or a music teacher anything like that you got to get a Squarespace site sellers that their availability services prices and appointments are published in payments collected via that Squarespace website social media text for email for Squarespace also makes it super easy to throw  halfway there do that for free but when you're ready to pay to publish your site safety percent with my code Ragusa that's in the description along with a link thank you Squarespace thanks Mom I mean these brownies are not the biggest thing I owe you but they're closed  caramel I don't even want to know what hard caramels would do in this recipe maybe explode we're going to take a package of German chocolate cake cake mix one of these standard boxes it's just under a pound for 32 grams I'm sure any
