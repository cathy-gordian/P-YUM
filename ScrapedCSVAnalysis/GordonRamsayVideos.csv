Maine of beef cheek Ragu with Papa Deli Big Cheese just think the size of your little cheeks yeah imagine the size of a cow with them and the cheek is right underneath here yeah um yeah I always give them a really nice season with salt and pepper on there please so beef cheeks very cheap my cut that takes sort of a long time to cook yeah but give it a bit of love let it cook in the oven it comes out like a dream a little touch of oil in the pan what we want to do is get them really nicely colored shed see it into the pan oh cool layaway get what that is um [Music] sitting at the dock of the beach beach and then I want the onion chunky because I'm gonna cook it for like three three and a half hours so you go down down and then again there and there so it doesn't overcook so a really good color on the cheeks like that so how do you cook these at a restaurants if they take so long they go in the oven literally half past six seven o'clock in the morning three and a half four hours ready for lunch and the longer you leave them in their juices yeah and the cooking liquor the better King eyes closed the garlic good onions in and garlic in please nice where's your Bailey there it is get those onions and that garlic really nicely colored put the cheeks back in place right red wine in cool okay the red wine is going to deglaze the pan so deglaze will basically sort of rinse all that flavor off the bottom of the pan yeah okay because that's going to make the most amazing sauce now you could use tomato puree but chopped canned tomatoes you'll make a much better sauce I'm gonna top that with some stock so the secret of braising is having little of the meat exposed and 90 of it submerged see them now yeah they're like little crocodile heads popping up out the water turn the gas off and leave the lid just off at the end there if we had to cover it completely the steam hits the top yeah the lid and all that water comes running back it's solar still that's right in the oven 140 150 for about three and a half to four hours good job Boom for pudding I'm making one of my absolute favorite Italian desserts Banna cotta with that quintessentially Italian flavoring espresso start by immersing two leaves of gelatin in cold water and leave to soak into a small saucepan add caster sugar cream milk sugar and a shot of good strong coffee gently bring to a simmer and remove from the hob [Music] wheeze out the soaked gelatin leaves and stir into the hot cream until completely dissolved pour your cream mixture into a jug and fill your molds just short of the rim rinsing your molds in cold water before filling will make it easier to get your panna cotta out once it's set [Music] leave in the fridge for at least two to three hours or overnight [Music] to make your cinnamon hazelnut brittle pour caster sugar into a pan and cook over medium Heat until the sugar melts to a deep golden brown [Music] scatter toasted hazelnuts into the caramel dust with ground cinnamon and leave to set at room temperature when your panna cotta is firm given each mold a quick dip into boiling water should ensure a perfect stress-free exit onto the plate foreign [Music] crunchy hazelnut brittle nothing could be so deliciously elegant right Captain Jack quick run through Panna cottas are nearly set beef cheeks I need it cooked we're going to now do the Fig and brighter crostini oh okay let's take the figs we're gonna make a nice slightly spicy fig Jam take off the tops yep in half and each half into three sugar a touch of salt in there okay we're making a jam but we don't want a bit too sweet and then these little babies what are they ah what's the shape stars star underneath taken from the fantasy plant yeah when you dry them like that so intensifies the flavor really important to count how many put in there okay yeah so one two three four five so they're just there from flavors that's right secret here let's get that camera going so when I hear a jam I don't think of caramel no but this is a very fast Jam caramel's starting to color I want you very carefully to drop the figs in there good so the juice out of the figs is starting to break down the camera you know what that is a little sweet vanilla I love that on my challenge got that sort of sweet and sour flavor leave that cooking for three four minutes now let's slice out chapata in Italian crostini means little bits of toast but it could be made out of leftover baguette sourdough or any crusty open textured bread we're staying authentically Italian with ciabatta season them and then drizzle a little touch of olive oil on there both sides really important because we're going to grill the bread push it down put some lovely very lovely take it off with the chapata toasted we need to carefully extract the star anise pods from our piping hot fig Jam my Jack we've got one little bugger to find oh no is it there yes it is right now we've got the green light to crush [Music] skins disintegrated in that caramel that looks so nice oh Jack carefully spreads the crostini with our hot fig Jam I can unveil the last element to our starter the creamy Italian specialty burrata [Music] my little money bags looking delicious this looks fun doesn't it we need to season them lightly drizzle over a little olive oil and dust them with lemon zest imagine that sat there and you tear some of that off and you stick it on top of that and um back to the main course to match our hearty beef cheeks I've chosen to use Papa Deli rule number one when cooking pasta salt in first salt and first good olive oil in pasta in twist it round so you don't break it no bring that back up the ball that's going to take that through for four minutes flat leaf parsley scrunch it up for me yep and chop him now wait to see these beef cheeks beauties look at them they're very soft tiny I'm going to taste um it's so good yeah you just dribbled on your jumper really right drain the pasta salt pepper pasta little drizzle of olive oil I'm going to put your fresh pasta nicely chopped nicely chopped in this is the magic bit okay you take a little Ladle of the juice put that at the bottom and you put the pasta on top of that sauce honestly oh my gosh your sisters are gonna love you even more now you know that uh what about when you cook this for your girlfriend one day uh just tell her where you got the recipe for money promise promise I don't want you stealing Daddy's Thunder one beautiful jaw on there two beautiful Jaws on there and then the third job and then you go over the sauce how cool is that delicious you've got the borrasa and I've got the cheeks let's go don't be cheeky get it my ultimate Italian dinner quick fig Jam crostini with creamy borata a main course of slow cooked beef cheek Ragu with Papa Deli and for pudding espresso panna cotta with cinnamon hazelnut brittle a stunning meal to bring the whole family together in the best Italian tradition a delicious saffron flatbread with mussels it doesn't get any healthier than that first job the super easy saffron flatbread put the saffron into the bowl and a couple of teaspoons of hot water that starts to infuse the saffron and so you can maximize on the color across your flatbeds to make the dough simply add plain flour a pinch of salt and pepper to a bowl and then pour in a dash of olive oil that makes the dough nice and silky and Rich you're saffron water you'll see how concentrated it is now and then you'll need cold water then simply need to bring the dough together mop up all your flour you can see now saffron's activated it's got that really nice color beautiful use your wrist and just knead it nicely we'll do now is smoothing out the gluten strands push and tuck in push and tuck in and each every time you do this getting softer you just sort of form like this perfect beautiful though it smells delicious that saffron is a powerful now sit that in your bowl cover your clean film let it rest for 10 to 15 minutes this relaxes the dough making it easier to roll and gives it time to infuse with the saffron I'm going to cut that into three and then roll them nice and thinly now lightly flour the surface and then just bring that it's like a perfect ball on the board your rolling pin and just roll it out now it doesn't get any simpler than that and then just lightly flour that on top a little salt cooking the flatbread is easy just pop in a hot dry pan and they're ready in minutes as it hits the pan it starts to blister is ready for turning beautiful get that color on there now you want it nice and crisp almost blistering on both sides because it's nice and thin it's cooked once browned on both sides just cool on a rack flatbread done now onto the mussels now the secret behind cooking great mussels is in the speed you're cooking the key is to chop and prep your ingredients before you start cooking first thing pancetta I want it quite chunky if you can't get pancetta I always like to use a sort of streaky bacon because I want to sort of render all that flavor add this tricky bacon now Tomatoes garlic and chili cherry tomatoes that's just going in whole the garlic just crush the garlic it's all that flavor comes out chili I want some heat in here that's everything prepped now to get it cooked a little touch of olive oil pancetta in foreign takes moments once it's brown and crisp put your garlic chili and whole cherry tomatoes into the pan muscles go in okay and I'm using dry sherry I think it works better in this recipe than white wine which is classically used at this stage then oregano finely chopped stalks and all I go on and then just give that a little mix and see those muscles start to open lid goes on you've got to lock in that flavor gotta lock in that heat the mussels will take four to five minutes to steam in the meantime cut your flatbreads into strips crispy and crunchy now the mussels wow that is incredible my goodness me [Music] now that is one lunch I definitely don't want to miss healthy and delicious it doesn't get any better than that incredible steam mussels with saffron flatbreads made in minutes and packed with protein and vitamins

stretch the pastry that thin and get it even it's an absolute nightmare Life's too short to make it at home when you can buy amazing phyllo pastry so when working with it always get a nice damp cloth and just lay the damp cloth over it that keeps it nice and moist and it stops the filo pastry from actually drying out put a pan on to melt your butter it's the butter that gives the crispiness to the filo pastry have you ever got a brush or coat feel a pastry with butter and make sure that butter is nicely seasoned you take your first layer layer onto the balls nice brush that with your butter and the nice thing about filo pastry is that it can be used for Savory and sweet these are going to have a fragrance Savory flavor with thyme black pepper and parmesan cheese so no need for salt lift up the corner and fold very quickly brush the ends and just nip those ends together non-stick pan on a little splash of olive oil fry the pastry for one to two minutes on each side so you want them to sort of puff up the secrets get them quickly you can smell that cheese in that time you're looking for them to become golden and crispy simple as that and then out smells delicious and as they sit and cool down instantly they become really nice and crispy the filo goes fantastically well with thick creamy Greek yogurt and a drizzle of runny honey and there's something quite sort of Middle East and about the herb the yogurt and the honey and the sort of crispy textures of the filo pastry an alternative savory breakfast when you want a stunning and sophisticated breakfast that mixes fragrant herbs and cheese with glorious honey yogurt this Middle Eastern treat hits the spot and it's so simple to make gorgeous grilled lamb copters with my incredible Twist on the Middle Eastern classic hummus first job glorious beetroot hummus I'm gonna blend and puree the cooked chickpea and the beetroot now the beetroot gives that pickly delicious flavor to the hummus beetroots in with the chickpea a nice seasoning of salt and pepper a tablespoon of olive oil a tablespoon of tahini this is roasted sesame seeds pounded and mixed with oil crushed garlic and toasted cumin seeds grind then pop into a blender [Music] I love that nice dark Rich color and you finish it with a nice lemon slice it in half take out the seeds and squeeze the fresh lemon juice at the end just wakes up the acidity in the beetroot but really cuts the richness of the chickpea and the lemon juice is pivotal it really brings the beetroot and the chickpeas together chickpeas are packed with protein very dense and it needs that kind of acidity one more little blend lovely nice little taste that's delicious homemade beetroot hummus so tasty and it really is that easy to make to finish some toasted cumin seeds and sumac that is delicious it's a sort of Middle Eastern spice and then some sesame seeds finish that off with margarine almost done now for my copters panel onion nice and finely diced garlic three nice clothes squeeze the garlic over the onions onions garlic in you get a really nice color on them after that a nice teaspoon of chili flakes beautiful now into our pestle and mortar with a teaspoon of toasted cumin give that a little bit of salt in there helps grind it down that is such a lovely smell aromatic exciting spicy intriguing once ground to a fine powder sprinkle your spices into the onion and garlic to create a wonderful aromatic paste now for the lamb mints lightly season it and then add all that wonderful flavor next for some freshness parsley and mint roughly chopped and a glug of olive oil put your hands in there and give that a really good mix traditionally you can see koftas on little sticks barbecue skewers and depending Where You Are they have different sort of variations and shapes and sizes I much prefer the nice little sort of almost like little mini Burgers like little mini sliders but these can be griddled these can be fried in a pan or even cooked on the barbecue start by Rolling the mix into a golf pool size then flatten out always lightly oil your plate that way when you set them in the fridge don't need to be all again they're just going straight into the pan because they've got oil underneath and all on top keep your hands lightly oiled and it helps stop the lamb from sticking to your fingers then pop them into the fridge to set and firm up before cooking now you can cook the kofta in a frying pan on the barbecue or an amazing little griddle pan gets the plaque really nice and hot whilst that heats I'm making a yogurt dip I love a nice sort of fresh minted yogurt put fresh mint leaves salt and a pinch of toasted cumin and black pepper into a pestle and mortar to grind as you start to sort of blend the mint almost turns into a nice fresh mint puree and smell out of that it's incredible add yogurt and I like Greek best and a squeeze of lemon look at that now beautiful now the copter so they go on [Music] one of the biggest problems on cooking copper is that they move them too early and they start to break up but let them Grill and by grilling them they'll naturally lift off the bar once they're charcoaled and so literally two two and a half minutes each side now turn it over beautiful smell is incredible once browned on both sides they're ready to serve on [Music] delicious I absolutely love lunches like this because it's sort of bold food that's packed full of freshness and great flavors these quick and easy minty lamb koftas serve with beetroot hummus are perfect for a relaxed meal your family and friends will all want to tuck into foreign

cooking for a special occasion you want to nail some key things one your recipes need to be bulletproof you don't want a disaster on the big day two as well as tasting phenomenal they have to be easy to serve so you can relax and enjoy yourself three when you're out to impress food needs to look great too my first recipe fits the build perfectly stuffed Lamb with spinach and pine nuts stuff meats are perfect for special occasions they look impressive taste amazing but more importantly they are so simple to do pan on for the stuffing it's a saddle of lamb basically a sort of Rolls-Royce cut perfectly shaped and it suits stuffing it's an absolute tea for the stuffing finally chop an onion garlic nice thin slices oil in onions and garlic in it's just salt and pepper make sure the stuffing is Juicy seasoned so it helps to season the inside of the Lamb now we've got the color on those onions I'm going to throw in some pine nuts and that helps to give a bit of a texture here's where it starts getting really exciting spinach in and just lay the spinach over the pine nuts it looks like a lot of spinach that's going to condense and disappear almost instantly so much more flavor as soon as when you start it as opposed to steaming it or boiling it gas off look at that now to bring that together no eggs no bread crumbs crumbled feta over the spinach feta cheese adds a beautifully salty sharp and creamy flavor what this does it brings that stuffing together now open up the lamb keep those little fillets to the side that's the channel that we want to stuff so I want to just open that up a little bit there salt and pepper lightly and before we put our stuffing in we're going to season it with Sumo sumac is a wonderful lemony spice that goes brilliantly with lamb and you can get it in most big supermarkets and it sort of cuts through that thick Rich sweetness of the Lamb open up that lamb there take a spoon if you're preparing this for the day ahead then let the stuffing cool down it's inevitable when you start rolling it and tying it something's going to squeeze out so load up the ends take these Beauties these little fillets and just support that stuffing and sort of increase that beautiful tunnel and then from there over there and bring that towards you and then roll like I said some of the stuff is going to come out now I'm going to tie it first off around the side and don't worry about some flash which is not just tight one in the middle you can get butcher's strength from your local butcher or at cookware shops I got two ties go too Thai it just forces all that stuffing out of the Lamb when it's in the oven nice now I want to season the top of it roll the joint to make sure all the skin gets seasoned now you think normally that just goes in the oven like that that's how my mum would do it but get your tray onto the gas oil in get it really nicely colored none of your stuffing's coming out of the sides really important look at that color beautiful it does kick start the roasting process gas off into the oven cook for 45 to 55 minutes depending on how pink you want your lamb lift the lamb out of the fat to rest resting it raised up in the tin will stop it cooking but not cool it down too quickly that means you won't lose any of those lovely juices next I'm making a simple but sophisticated accompaniment for the lamb top and tell the Cucumber peel it cut the Cucumber into three and just core taking out all that it's just sort of watery seedium it spoils the flavor slice the Cucumber cucumber in really nice way of making a cheap and cheerful cucumber look at the Hammers we're going to dress that cucumber with a nice fresh yoghurt a couple of tablespoons next some fresh mint dress it touch of salt Touch of pepper and then pomegranate molasses that just swings it up finish that with lemon mix that up lamb is rested carefully take off the string and then just gently pull them back straight edge knife that's going to cut through that crispy fat on the outside instantly I tied it purposely so I can guess my portion control from the lines hold it nice and firmly look at your line where the string was and look this one is going to be amazing lay and down just in those two slices there it proves that stuffing Meats is for special occasions because that is a saddle of lamb at its absolute best stuffing meats and fish not only makes them look fantastic it also gives them an extra added flavor Dimension too once you've mastered the technique you'll be able to turn out dishes that will guarantee you'll have an unforgettable Feast here are three more of my favorite easy stuff dishes that are perfect for any Feast first up chicken with garlic and Chestnut stuffing packed with flavor and earthy richness for the stuffing before I finely chopped onion garlic and celery in hot olive oil next add pine nuts which have a lovely creamy taste and chopped earthy cooked chestnuts both add a wonderfully chewy texture and richness to stuffings season and add chopped parsley [Music] then stirring cooked wild rice next take a whole deboned chicken it's fiddly to do at home but if you ask your butcher will do it for you and pile the stuffing mixture along the center now simply roll the chicken up tightly and tie it with your butcher's string then roast in a hot oven for just over an hour simply carve into magnificent thick slices so impressive so easy and trust me this is a dish guaranteed to get a fantastic reaction on any occasion holster fish will always make an impression my next recipe is the bass stuffed with fennel lemon and capers first place a whole gutted sea bass on foil and season the fish inside and out sea bass is known as the king of the Seas and has a wonderful sweet white flesh start the stuffing with sliced fennel its aniseed flavor works brilliantly with the fish next add Capers fresh dill slices of lemon then dot in knobs of butter lastly add a splash of white wine which helps to steam the fish and creates a lovely sauce and seal tightly into a parcel this locks in all the juices and flavor then simply bake in a medium oven unwrap and hear your guess ooh and R with delight prepared in 10 minutes wrap for intense flavor a stunning sea bass that's bound to create a stir [Music] my next dish throws a Spanish Twist on a classic English roast pork stuffed with Manchego and menbrillo use a pork loin roasting joint lay the joints skin side down and cut and cut three quarters of the way into the flesh creating space for the stuffing next thinly slice Spanish Manchego cheese this has a wonderful buttery nutty taste and is fantastic for stuffing as it melts brilliantly slice Spanish umbrella Queen's jelly sweet and perfumed is the perfect partner for the saltiness of the cheese then simply layer your cheese and Quince jelly into the pork add Sage leaves for a strong and deliciously bitter flavor roll the meat up and tie with butcher's string next add more Sage leaves and some aromatic fresh thyme to a roasting tin then lay the pork on top skin Side Up cut a bulb of garlic in half and wedge it under the meat the garlic wedges help lit the pour so it roast to Perfection and will add a sweet depth or flavor to your gravy drizzle with olive oil season and roast for just over an hour with the heat on high for the first 20 which helps get the skin crispy and golden [Music] once cooked leave the pork to rest as you make a stunning gravy simply Place The Roasting tin over medium Heat add a lug of Sherry and delays using the roasting juices gives

braised stuffed lamb breast one of the secrets to slow cooking is to be robust and really get stuck in big bold flavors work brilliantly well so don't be precious this is gutsy cooking at its absolute

and a half hours and forget about it whoa beautiful all that was reduced down to this amazing nice tomato sauce and the lamb it's kept its color look at that that's braised beautifully very carefully little bits there it's nice off pull off the little bits of string this is why I get really excited the secret is not to slice it too thinly look at that smell the lemon it's hard to believe when you slice through the center there but that is a very cheap cut of meat on salivating I love this I mean it's just incredible pick up the tomatoes and the olives and the onions and amazing Rich sauce take your lamb sort of just hit it on it looks incredible that for me is why chefs get so excited with cheap Cuts because the end results are incredible delicious breast of lamb with lemon anchovies chili and oregano [Music] slow cooking is a fantastic way to develop delicious deep flavors here are three of my easy one pot wonders minimum preparation long cook and an amazing wonderful taste first up easy ballito misto a classic Italian mixed meat dish [Music] I'm starting with some Italian fennel sausages [Music] fry them until colored making sure all sides are nicely browned set them aside then slice chorizo a spicy Spanish sausage with a wonderful Smoky taste and Fries so releases all its incredible flavor [Music] next chop carrots celery garlic and add to the same pan this keeps in all the flavor stirring the pre-lentals these are excellent for slow cooked dishes because they retain their firm texture and shape next add a bay leaf and some fresh thyme sprigs then the sausages go back in along with chicken stock simmer until the lentils are tender then season to taste [Music] finally sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve simple to prepare a cinch to make and packed full of delicious hearty flavors my Twist on an Italian classic magnificent easy ballito misto [Music] foreign dish is slow cooked aubergine dice the aubergine and fry in hot olive oil until colors on all sides then add a finely sliced onion and chopped garlic cook until tender cook butter beans and pomegranate molasses which is a sweet thick and glossy Tangy reduction of pomegranate juice season [Music] next add a can of chopped tomatoes bring to a simmer and cook until the aubergine has a gloriously soft and silky texture stir through top mint pile onto toasted bread and finally for a lovely salty Tang crumble over some creamy feta cheese preparation but slow cook for maximum flavor aubergines like you've never tasted before one more dish that uses time to transform a humble ingredient is perfect slow cooked beef foreign [Music] start by frying the beef Shin in hot oil seasoning as you go it's a very economical cut of beef as it slow Cooks it also makes the most delicious gravy as the marrow thickens and flavors the sauce [Music] the same pan saute chopped carrots peeled whole shallots sliced celery peeled and chopped ginger and garlic next add tomato puree and cook for a few minutes [Music] add the shin back into the pan with a glass of dry white wine and the juice of an orange this deglazes the pan adding incredible depth of flavor [Music] pour in chicken stock season and simmer for an hour and 20 minutes brilliant finish with gremolata a dry Italian salsa made with chopped herbs simply chop parsley and garlic together and mix in the zest of an orange or lemon when the beef is cooked Rich anxious and beautifully tender scatter over the lovely fresh gremolata simple satisfying and crammed full of wonderful taste and textures delicious fast to prepare cheap and easy to make slow cooked to Perfection three amazing dishes I guarantee you'll make time and time again [Music] this is my Essential guide to kitchen equipment everything you need to know about the basic kit that will get you cooking fantastic food casserole dish absolutely essential when it comes to good home cooking why so versatile the beauty of this thing is the fact that you can actually use it on the hob or start it on the hob and finish in the oven more importantly cast iron it conducts the heat so you can have the gas on absolute minimal or the oven down to its absolute lowest setting and the thing will just cook naturally casserole dishes are surprisingly versatile and a great investment you only need one and if you look after it it'll last you a lifetime brilliant for one pot wonders welcome back to my ultimate cookery course I'm teaching you my slow cooked favorites my guide to getting the best value from your butchers one of the biggest bills in the kitchen is going to be for meat so it's crucial you keep costs down but that doesn't mean sacrificing flavor especially when you use some slow cooking magic to get the best from cheap cuts to get value for money it always pays to ask an expert and fifth generation award-winning Master butcher Danny lidgate is a man in the know one of the great things about going to a butcher is they're going to have more Cuts available than most supermarkets so you're going to see things that people don't know about so one example might be the beef ribs a great product for slow cooking in the oven especially cooking on the bone you're going to get more flavors from the bone there's some really nice pieces of Juicy meat these only used for mints in the past now people are using it for braising or slow braising or even barbecuing it with some really nice marinades the oxtail are less popular now than maybe they used to be small little mussels make up the tail once that's slow cooked they all fall apart really tender juicy Meats also oxtail is Sublime en stews curries and soups another great cheap cut for slow cooking is one you saw me using earlier Lamb's breast [Music] is one of the least expensive cuts of lamb and it's also delicious slow roasted or stewed here we have the shin of beef you can see in the sheds made up lots of little different mussels these are always moving always doing work so slow cooking will give the best end results it's going to have fashion a little bit but it should be enjoyed by everybody it's a fantastic piece of meat here we have some ox cheeks and when they're trimmed you end up with a really lean piece of meat obviously with the cheek the cow's always eating munching on grass this means I need a lot of cooking but essentially it's a really nice healthy lean piece of meat with fantastic flavors oxchicks also make an incredible ravioli or Ragu and if you're a pork lover why not try pork neck it's a succulent alternative for a slow Sunday roast here we have a muscle from the shoulder it's called feather blades the reason it's called feather blade is because when it's cut each piece looks like a feather the gristle tends to be slow cooked and the more it's cooked we'll turn gelatinous giving a lovely jelly and juicy liquid to the meat fantastic for casserole pies and stews there are so many cheaper cuts which are brilliant for home cooking it's important with all these forgotten cuts to find out how to cook them don't be scared of them they're really economic but full of flavor and the end result is fantastic meal as a chef one of the biggest kicks I get is taking an ingredient that doesn't cost much and turning into something that looks and tastes like a million bucks my next recipe turns what used to be a decidedly unfashionable cut of meat into the star of the dish fit to Grace any table slow roasted pork belly with fennel slow roasting works better on fattier tougher and unfashionable cuts whether it's a cheek or even a neck or this amazing pork belly it's a fantastic way to transform cheap cuts into amazing melting perfection take a very sharp knife bring the pork belly towards you so you're over it you've got all that pressure and weight using the tip of the knife I'm just sort of nicking it I go across the pork belly long strokes with a knife take your time turn it 180 this time what we're doing is just sort of cutting those nice little sort of diamonds but as that starts roasting on top it starts to get nice and crispy take your handfuls of salt and just sort of rub it in bend it over and then all those cracks really helps to get a nice crisp crackling on top roasting tray getting really nice and hot take a hole over fennel to intensify flavor and to keep the meat succulent I'm braising my pork belly with strong vibrant spices and vegetables crush and peel three whole cloves of garlic and add to the fennel olive oil in fennel in I like the nice strong aniseed flavor that goes with that nice rich dense pork fennel seeds delicious Taiwanese in and just a couple of cardamom seeds and wow they're like little bangers like little firecrackers incredible lovely fresh bay leaves get your pork skin side down just sear the top of that fat that locks in all that amazing flavor then I'm gonna flip it over and get it nice and crispy and then on fennel seeds embedded in those little cracks now some white wine the minute that white wine hits that pan you can just smell that light fragrance and the fennel allow the wine to Bubble away and reduce until the alcohol is burnt off sometimes at the stock NOW the stock goes in just underneath the skin so it roasts on top all that meat under there it's gonna be submerged because what happens in the oven the top goes crispy as anything and the stock reduces and braises at the same time really importantly bring that back up to the ball before it goes in the oven otherwise it will never boil never go up to temperature smells incredible slow roasted pork belly at 180 degrees for two and a half hours [Music] look at that you've got that nice crispy skin on top you can see how much of the stock has evaporated put that onto the board it looks stunning to make a delicious rustic sauce with the flavor packed contents of the roasting tray first get rid of the excess fat take a couple of slices of bread it's like a perfect sponge because you just lay that on top and drag it almost like a net and it just absorbs all that fat if you want the perfect fried bread trust me stick that in a frying pan a nice teaspoon of mustard whisk that in and then simply simmer for a few minutes before pouring into a serving jug with your pork belly always use a nice serrated edge knife you can hear that wow that is amazing incredibly tender that belly of pork is gonna almost melt in your mouth you've got that sweet meat under that crispy belly of pork what an amazing way to cook a very cheap cut of meat [Music] foreign [Music] kitchen tips first how to make a fantastic chicken stock a classic slow cook recipe that gets amazing flavor from simple ingredients chicken stock ingredient to good cooking it trans sources it's a fantastic base for Soups and more importantly it's so easy to do a little bit of love and care at the beginning and it Cooks itself right step one chicken carcass into a high sided pan an onion does need to be finely chopped the vegetables flavor the stock onion in then from there cut your leek into nice big solid chunks roughly same size as the onion silver vegetables cook at the same time and then add carrots celery and garlic and then a nice sprig of thyme that helps to really give depth of flavor to the chicken stock a couple of bay leaves and some fresh parsley and then peppercorns pan and just lightly crush them and a little pinch of salt and now just cover the vegetables and the carcass with cold water just cover the chicken and the vegetables bring it up to the ball as quick as you can now as it comes into the boil a really nice skin take the base of a ladle and swirl that around that pushes all the grease and the impurities to the side of the pan then get your Laden and just tilt it if you don't skim all that off the stock becomes very cloudy people's impression of cooking stock then it needs to cook for three four hours at a time this is one chicken carcass let that boil away gently for 30 to 40 minutes maximum we're gonna pass it off let's take a sieve place that over the pan and then just pour that in it smells amazing it's aromatic the color is absolutely beautiful from there you have the most amazing stock when you need to season meat in flour a great tip is to place it in a plastic bag to dust it evenly using flour also helps the sauce to get nice and thick during cooking when Browning meat fry in small batches don't crowd the pan otherwise it won't sear or color properly when slow roasting meat line the bottom of the roasting tray with chunky vegetables like onions fennel and carrots they act as a trivet to keep the meat from boiling in its own juices plus the veg can be the base for your gravy later on after slow cooking baked on residue can be tough to remove but if

first up how to keep your knife Sharp it's far harder working in the kitchen with a blunt knife than it is with a sharp knife the secret behind keeping a sharp knife sharpen it before and every time you use it first grip the steel feel really comfortable about holding the still imagine you're holding a tennis racket or you're playing squash you've got to be really comfortable with it now 45 degrees confident grip confident grip with a knife this is the butt of the steel really important to keep your fingers behind there you never grip a steel with your fingers over that because the knife comes back in you've just lost a finger always grip behind nice long strokes so we get the whole of the blade over Steel stroke and we start from the bottom to the top so there cross there across slow Strokes over the top of the steel and then come back underneath then back underneath it is so dangerous working in the kitchen with a blunt knife you can cause so much damage working with a sharp knife is 10 times quicker more efficient now that's ready to start chopping stop your chopping board rocking or slipping a great tip is to Simply wet a kitchen cloth kitchen paper or tea towel and

for making long delicate parmesan shavings to top soups and salads it also makes wonderful chocolate curls your pepper mill is more versatile than you might think tighten the top screw to get finely

out the peeled cloves [Music] this is my ultimate cookery course 100 recipes to stake your life on I'll be showing you a roast chicken recipe to die for hold the drum and slice straight through but first like any good Chef I'm always looking to get great ingredients at the right price my shopping Mantra is simple first rely on your senses make sure whatever you're buying it looks smells and really feels good and if you get the chance taste it before you buy it second is to recognize that knowledge is crucial the more you know about where your ingredients come from and how they produce the better so ask lots of questions and learn you're never too old to learn from experts and when it comes to buying great birds one person knows what to look for is award-winning fifth generation Master butcher Danny lidgate poultry is a great meet because there's many different types of birds it's worth tasting the variation of flavors between different first and first is massive turkey is a great lean meat that's available all year round not just for Christmas anybody who's worried about eating fatty Meats is a really healthy flavoursome meal okay game birds people don't try them often enough once they're shots they're hung up for a little while but a few days at least it means the meat's going to be more tender it all adds in flavor to the birds we've got a wood pigeon and a red leg Partridge both really good and cook really quickly when you're buying a chicken some of the things to look out for is obviously the smell and when you're smelling a good quality chicken you can tell the difference the Skin's a nice white color and it smells like a fresh chickeny smell when you're buying from a good butcher you'll find you tend to get the giblets as well which is basically the neck and other orgas this is great for making gravy once you have cooked it you can use all the off cuts for other things stir fries curries pasta dishes save the bones use the bones for stocks and soups a really packed full of flavor and remember there are lots of different breeds of chicken all have different characteristics and flavors so shop around and find the ones you love here are three of my all-time favorites the label onglay these come from an old British breed they've got smaller breasts but the meat's delicious the black leg a fantastic French variety succulent with bags of flavor and really meaty thighs and the police this is the Rolls-Royce of chickens Rich gamey and delicious one for special occasions I think people should maybe try and buy Less meat but aim for the best quality you're only going to get out what you put in by putting the best quality into a dish you're going to get the best results no matter how season the chef you are there are always new ingredients and recipes to get fired up about so if a tidal recipe is getting you down spice it up with fresh ideas and flavors this recipe is an old classic roast chicken but with a simple twist it takes on a new life and is guaranteed to impress one of the things I love about cooking and that keeps me excited after 25 years behind the stove is that there's always something new to learn every day new ingredients new techniques and new cuisines start off with the stuffing it's amazing how exciting a stuffed roast chicken can be because it keeps the chicken incredibly moist and gives a delicious texture inside the bird I'm going to start off with cured chorizo this is a traditional Spanish sausage and it's garlicky spicy incredibly meaty that gives a little bit of sort of richness to the stuffing get a freezer in start cooking that down and getting all those oils out little touch the olive oil in there to get it going right onions chopped add the onions to the chorizo and in a matter of seconds they'll change color as they soak up all the flavor that lovely spiciness has been stolen from that sausage and now the onions smell incredible garlic garlic in fresh thyme just hold it down and put your fingers on there and it's a really nice way of taking off all those nice fragrant little time flowers you can hear it cracking in the background these are cannellini beans they're waxy very soft and so delicious but very dense but for stuffing they're so robust nothing breaks down drain them off in they're going to take on all that juice as well from this freezer I'm going to season them now because they're very dense so it needs some help and that looks like it's a dish on its own good enough to eat now I want to sweeten things up a little bit Tomatoes half dried in that sweetens up the stuffing beautiful the stuffing's ready look at the color everything Spanish it looks delicious now stuffing the chicken I like taking off these little knuckles as the chicken Cooks the skin stretches over the bone you can get a really nice drum and take off those little wing tips as well salt pepper so important now you're stuffing I want to go right inside the chicken push it down this really helps to cook the bird evenly because you're pushing out all the empty spaces in the carcass and take a nice large Lemon push the lemon in pick up the parcel's nose pull the skin over olive oil on top sauce pepper a teaspoon of paprika sprinkle it on and then get your hands and sort of rub that in and see what the paprika's doing to the chicken putting this like sweet spicy marinade it's not even roasted yet but it looks delicious [Music] 400 ml white wine same quantity of water that helps the chicken to steam Chicken in be generous with the time Sprigs make sure the fall is folded tightly around the roasting tray so the chicken steams in the oven keeping it moist and juicy into the oven [Music] cook for one hour at 180 degrees with a foil on nice take it out and remove the full lid then give it another 30 minutes to crisp up that skin look at that so important to make sure you take that tinfoil off with half an hour to go beautiful Pierce that open squeeze it in that delicious gravy mix that into the tray sieve that that's a really nice fragrant lemony spiced roasting juices to finish before we cut up the chicken take out amazing stuffing [Music] incredible I'd have that with chicken over potatoes any day and then just get your chicken roasting juices now cut the chicken up hold the drum and slice straight through and there's that wonderful

sandwiches [Music] for me the secret of a great brunch is fun and Casual fuss-free cooking and everyone helping themselves this is the ultimate steak sandwich you want the Rolls-Royce of beef it has to be fillet now season it beautifully I like to open up the top of the pepper mill to increase the size of the pepper in the steak so it gives that bit of heat nice little chunks you just roll now nicely all the way around slice the garlic in half pan nice and hot olive oil in hold the steak and just place it into the pan don't drop it at the front of the pan we're going to till the pan forward to cook the back of a steak dual purpose now roll it back and see it underneath next my garlic and roast that garlic thyme fry that time I want to hear it we're not looking for a lot of color because you're going to dry out the fillet so just one end turn it back down and clear the other end in lift up your thyme place it on top of the garlic the lift up your fillet and sit that on top of your garlic butter in take a spoon tilt the pan gently lift up and baste I've got that scented garlic thyme flavor steak is going to cook evenly because it's sat on a little a little bit in the oven for eight to ten minutes [Music] pan on for the relish you think of a steak sandwich you think of a sort of nice heated tomato relish to make the relish finely dice a red onion three finger rule one in front two behind through and chop wow next roughly chop a chili keeping the seeds in for extra heat start off with the olive oil into a pan onions chili [Music] generous with the olive oil I want a nice sort of Rich silky relish from the biggest Tomatoes you can just use red tomatoes but these yellow and red make the perfect combination now put your salt in pepper and then roast those Tomatoes off take a wooden spoon and just sort of break them up once the Skins blister the whole tomato just starts to release all that really nice sweet texture little teaspoon of cherry vinegar gives that nice acidic balance the sweetness of the tomatoes turn down the gas and just let them sort of Stew perfectly now a steak sandwich would not be complete unless it had the most amazing mustard mayonnaise simply add three tablespoons of mayonnaise to three teaspoons of whole grain mustard [Music] now I've got the relish almost down to like a really nice jam now I want to make that relish a little bit more fragrant some basil slice it through sprinkle that basil in there [Music] beautiful look at this there she is my crown jewels time to take it out smell is incredible just based one more time fill it touches quite soft in the center so it's just coming up to mid-rare let it rest the same time you cooked it would be nice and pink evenly throughout the steak to make my sandwich I'm going to char grill some sliced Jupiter bread season it nicely just a little drizzle of olive oil I want to get that bread nice and crispy pan nice and hot bread in push it down smell is amazing that Char sort of charcoal flavor we've got those marks on the bread it's just stops the bread from becoming soggy and look at this here it is stunning on slice it gently one beautiful slice wow it's nice and pink all the way through and the beef is so soft it's almost like slicing through butter let the knife do the work take a little bit of mayonnaise spread that the back of the spoon on both sides next lettuce take that beautiful slice of beef well and then relish on top of that beef and just slice the sandwich in half beautiful now that's what I call a steak sandwich trust me so the sublime sandwich for brunch and you'll put a smile on everyone's face next up my guide to buying the best beef and steaks the ultimate brunch you can't do any better than start with a perfect steak and one man who really knows his steak is Master butcher Danny lidgate steak is my favorite type of meat and I think it's really good to enjoy different varieties of steak when choosing a steak that you want you need to look at exactly what you want out of it for my ultimate steak sandwich I used to fill it because it's the most tender the fillet does the least amount of work than all the other mussels it's tucked away in the rib cage this means that when you're buying a fillet it's incredibly soft like butter it's the most expensive but you get what you pay for there's a wide array of cuts to choose from all different in taste and texture if in doubt ask your butcher this would be the ramp section where the rump comes from which is basically the back side take the bone out and what you're left with is a wonderful steak rum steak characteristically a little bit tougher than the sirloin or a little bit chew it in the ribeye but a really strong flavor for the steak again when buying rum look for the marbling try and get some fat covering on the steak you can always cut it off after it's cooked Rams one of the best value Stakes I love it thinly cut and fresh fried in stir fries or simply marinated and whacked on the barbecue another great value but delicious gut is the hanger steak known as the butcher's cut because they often keep it for themselves it's great marinated and cooked quickly with the sirloin which is basically the back of the animal a nice sirloin like this really well marbled don't buy too lean so once the solo is trimmed up it looks something like this

brunches the most laid-back meal of the week and if you want to take it easy having the right equipment makes all the difference [Music] here's my guide to the best kitchen equipment [Music] everything you need to know about the basic kit that will get you cooking fantastic food chopping boards for brunch one of the most useful things is a great chopping board get the right one and it'll be your friend for life I prefer a sort of heavy duty one because they're so much more durable they can be flipped over the minute you want to go from vegetables to prepping fish or meat always keep a little Jake off underneath that actually stops the board from sliding care for your wooden board by rubbing it with oil every so often any cooking oil will do wooden boards for me are always the best easy to clean and long lasting when you do wash your wooden board never let it stand in water or put it in the dishwasher as it may split buy the best you can afford and take good care of it [Music] for brunch I love something sweet and I've always been a fan of classic British crumpets with butter and jam but once you try cooking them at home you'll never want to buy them from shops again this is another great recipe you can stay your life on it's my homemade crumpet whether you're cooking for two three or even a gang some of the best brunch dishes are always the simplest these crumpets are absolutely delicious and it's a great end to a fantastic brunch first off we're going to make the mix what do you think of growing up the smell and the taste of amazing crumpet it never leaves you to make the mix the secret is to bring the milk up the ball but do not boil it the minute it boils turn it off and let it sit there now flowering a nice pinch of salt in now add half a teaspoon of bicarb that gives it aeration and really lifts the mixture up all those lovely little holes a nice Pinch of Sugar and then a teaspoon of yeast dry yeast now once the milk's boiled turn it off and add some warm water about 10 tablespoons 150 ml that cools down the milk but more importantly it doesn't destroy the yeast half of the milk in first stop and give that a really good mix now the rest of it [Music] [Music] you can just see that there's no lumps through there as it drips through the Whisk now we're looking for it to double in size and get nice and light so pop in a warm place whilst you get on with a delicious topping beautiful strawberries but caramelized almost like a very quick strawberry jam hang on just slice these in half some sugar a couple of tablespoons we're gonna take the sugar to a nice light camera it's just starting to change color now turn the gas down and we're going to add the strawberries beautiful just sweating the strawberries down quickly and the caramel is breaking down a wonderful glaze on the strawberries some lemon grated into the strawberries gives it that kind of freshness that really starts to break down the strawberries nice up smells incredible some lemon juice a touch of balsamo vinegar and that gives it a really nice delicious tartness now if it goes as the strawberries start to cool down it will naturally thicken and set beautifully now for the crumpet it's almost doubled in size but be very careful you don't knock the ball because it can sort of push out all that air it's aerated as nice as light just see the texture she's ready to go did you boil it here we go instead of making normal small crumpets I'm making a giant one ideal for sharing now turn the gas down you just start to see a traditional Crumpet style cooking process we want those nice tiny little holes on top and that Crispy Crunchy base right now it's time to add the butter and just slide the butter down the bag that gives it a really nice nutty flavor at the end fish slice slip beautiful take that out [Music] Jam spoon it over the secret is for the juice to sort of run inside all those little holes think of that tartness of the balsamic vinegar the strawberries beautifully soft and almost pureed rats and that delicious now finish that with a nice ball of creme fresh let that sit there and that is an amazing way of finishing off a traditional brunch with something sweet something delicious and something you're dying to tuck into [Music] next my tricks the trade and kitchen tips fruit can be a great healthy option for brunch and knowing how to get the best out of it can make all the difference first up how to peel and cut a mango the easy way holding its stalk end up cut either side of the stone cut all the way into the flesh making squares without cutting through the skin then turn it inside out and carefully cut your pieces off foreign tip to check if a pineapple is ripe is to pull a leaf out from the top if it comes away easily it's ripe and ready for slicing my tip to get the flesh out of a kiwi is to Simply cut the fruit in half and scoop out with a teaspoon try it it really works if you have fruit that's not perfectly ripe the tip is to put a banana in a paper bag then add your unripe fruit put it in a dark place and the banana will speed up the ripening process of the other fruit foreign you can make a grapefruit puree to accompany a brunch pancake or a crumpet in a blender to clean it afterwards add a cup of warm water and run the machine for a few seconds empty out and simply repeat with a drop of washing up Liquid then rinse [Music] of course bursting with valuable lessons top tips and 100 recipes to take your life on and you'll literally be cooking yourself into a better chef many of these

you know where everything is stock spatula pan Etc it becomes less stressful but more importantly the end results are incredible [Music] first off panel with and stock with this amazing fermented soybean puree into the pan three nice tablespoons gas on now get your fish stock and whisk into the puree be generous with the stock you want this nice light broth basically you can buy miso paste from Big supermarkets and it works brilliantly with salmon poaching the salmon in the Miso stuff gives it a really nice sort of sweet earthy creamy flavor it's incredible bring up to the ball I'm gonna Infuse the broth and make it a little bit more fragrant coffee or Lime Leaf is Bay lemony inside the Miso broth then chopped chili Chili's in and finely sliced Ginger that's simmering beautifully now we're going to post the salmon poaching means cooking it in liquid but it's cooked gently and the secret here is to keep that Salmon skin on if we took the skin off now the salmon can actually break up whilst it's poaching skin side down just gonna slide that in under nice the minute that stopping start boiling turn it down let it simmer take a little Ladle and just have a couple of minutes pour over that makes sure the top of the salmon is cooked evenly and keeps it nice and moist and poaching is one of the most delicate ways of cooking so you have to handle it with care whilst the salmon is poaching in the Miso broth start preparing your vegetables I'm using tender stem broccoli and Pak Choy I always like to cook the leaf and the stem separately the leaf is like sort of spinach and the stem is so much thicker it's almost as thick as a stick of celery so I like to get the stems sliced just sort of got that nice sort of Christmas place the leaves together nicely roll them up nice and tight and then slice them down now my salmon already the flavor in that broth has been elevated now it tastes really fishy got the heat chili spices the ginger and the cafe Lime Leaf take your fish slice and place it very gently underneath the salmon and push it down fish slices are flexible for that reason bend it lift it up it's touch looking for a springy firm texture just sit there on top a little touch of the broth over it stops it from drying out leave that to cool down for two minutes bring the stock back up to the boil broccoli in back Choy stems in a little taste it's getting better and better and better cook the broccoli and the bok choy stems for one minute and then add the tops in turn the salmon into your hand and just peel all that skin off the skin also helps to keep the salmon nice and moist then gently flake the salmon that's the secret behind poaching everything just stays so moist wonderful long shards of pink now just before we serve we're going to add our mushrooms these are enoki mushrooms you can buy these enoki mushrooms at Big supermarkets and good Grocers slice them off I'm going to put half in and the other half I'm going to serve with the salmon toasted sesame seed oil put a little drip in there just rub and you're just lining almost like a little coat of varnish start off with your mushrooms and then my salmon four nice layers and then finally the mushrooms top with the vegetables and then finally a nice ladle that beautiful really Sumptuous Rich stock lovely and that is an amazing misu poached salmon soup simplify your cooking by getting organized and amazing food will be coming out your kitchen every day and for great food you need great ingredients my recipe for meatballs is so versatile it can be used to make a dozen amazing dishes one of my favorites is meatballs and fragrant coconut broth having a freezer of home-cooked delicious food ready to go can be a real Lifesaver it means you never have to compromise on Flavor these meatballs are delicious but more importantly they freeze so well first off get your pan on and start sweating off your onions and your garlic this recipe involves making the meatballs the classic way but the exciting part is actually cook them in coconut milk and it gives a really nice new dimension to a sort of soft Rich Sumptuous meatball chop the onion nice and finely giving those slices very close together close to the slices the finer the onions cut it back down at an angle slice down just chop I want the onions nice and fine because I want some finesse to these meatballs The Secret of a really good meatball is the texture getting that balance right between the minced beef the breadcrumbs the milk and the seasoning a couple of cloves of garlic slice of garlic really nice and thinly nice pan nice and hot a tablespoon of olive oil quite generous with the olive oil onions and garlic in a little touch of salt and pepper with your mints open it up a little bit and sort of cut it out that's salt and pepper for me a good meatball is all about the the softness the texture of that Rich beef and the way it sort of melts in your mouth you can color it on the outside or you want it nice and soft and sort of rich in the center mix that in beautifully and then paste it back out again I've got some really nice dried chili flakes I'm going to season the onions with the chili flakes chili flakes in cook that out for two minutes I'm gonna add some milk [Music] take your breadcrumbs make a little well three four tablespoons of milk that makes a sort of nice slightly doughy texture but it lightens the texture of the meatball place that in add your onions your garlic and your chili in there as well nice put your hands in there and start mixing them if you've got the right amount of milk and breadcrumbs it doesn't mean binding with an egg don't make them too small problem with making them too small is the fact that they dry out quickly just the size of a golf ball a little bit bigger nice getting a really nice tight squeeze that stops IT from breaking up it always pays to double the recipe and spend a bit more time making extra meatballs so you can freeze a batch ready for another time give the pan a little wipe out don't wash out that pan we've got that flavor from the onions the garlic at the bottom look at that pan nice and hot Touch of olive oil in there place them the top of your pan nice and gently set them in the oil get a palette knife and go underneath them and just sort of tilt the pan and let the pan cook the back of the meatball we're going to add some heat coriander seeds slightly spicy and peppery just to give a really nice flavor to the coconut milk and next some cardamon seeds three or four onto the board knife on and no touch of turmeric into the center of the pan that's going to give it a really nice spicy flavor a little pinch cinnamon all the time you're doing this those meatballs are just getting tastier and tastier a couple of dried chilies let them Infuse in that oil and then some lemongrass just take the back of your knife and sort of Beat It Down that starts to release all that lovely sort of fragrance like someone's just let off the most amazing fragrant air freshener in for the lemongrass finally some fresh ginger peel it's nice nice and thinly time now turn them over and let the other half for a wonderful flavor to stop in bring the stock up to the boil turn the gas up and then add the coconut milk and I want the coconut milk just sitting underneath the top of a meatball coconut milk in and that sort of gives it that creamy richness but it's not heavy it's a fragrant light richness before we start simmering check the seasoning that nice soft texture of the meatball but that fragrance light richness of the coconut broth it's going to cook those meatballs perfectly bring the broth up to the boil and simmer gently for eight to ten minutes touch them with your finger they should be slightly pliable but slightly springy gas off and finish it off with something light and fresh zest of lime but I want the zest on top of the meatball sort of cut through that richness and then finally squeeze fresh lime and that just gives it that nice zesty amazing taste stirring the juice [Music] I've got that kick in that vibrant taste now the exciting part when you come to serve it be generous with that coconut broth talk the pan get a good couple of ladles of a broth in meatball [Music] and that is a very delicious way of eating a old-fashioned meatball and bringing it into the 21st century and they're just as good cooked from Frozen as well [Music]

cooking for a special occasion you want to nail some key things one your recipes need to be bulletproof you don't want a disaster on the big day two as well as tasting phenomenal they have to be easy to serve so you can relax and enjoy yourself three when you're out to impress food needs to look great too my first recipe fits the build perfectly stuffed Lamb with spinach and pine nuts stuff meats are perfect for special occasions they look impressive taste amazing but more importantly they are so simple to do pan on for the stuffing it's a saddle of lamb basically a sort of Rolls-Royce cut perfectly shaped and it suits stuffing it's an absolute tea for the stuffing finally chop an onion garlic nice thin slices oil in onions and garlic in it's just salt and pepper make sure the stuffing is Juicy seasoned so it helps to season the inside of the Lamb now we've got the color on those onions I'm going to throw in some pine nuts and that helps to give a bit of a texture here's where it starts getting really exciting spinach in and just lay the spinach over the pine nuts it looks like a lot of spinach that's going to condense and disappear almost instantly so much more flavor as soon as when you start it as opposed to steaming it or boiling it gas off look at that now to bring that together no eggs no bread crumbs crumbled feta over the spinach feta cheese adds a beautifully salty sharp and creamy flavor what this does it brings that stuffing together now open up the lamb keep those little fillets to the side that's the channel that we want to stuff so I want to just open that up a little bit there salt and pepper lightly and before we put our stuffing in we're going to season it with Sumo sumac is a wonderful lemony spice that goes brilliantly with lamb and you can get it in most big supermarkets and it sort of cuts through that thick Rich sweetness of the Lamb open up that lamb there take a spoon if you're preparing this for the day ahead then let the stuffing cool down it's inevitable when you start rolling it and tying it something's going to squeeze out so load up the ends take these Beauties these little fillets and just support that stuffing and sort of increase that beautiful tunnel and then from there over there and bring that towards you and then roll like I said some of the stuff is going to come out now I'm going to tie it first off around the side and don't worry about some flash which is not just tight one in the middle you can get butcher's strength from your local butcher or at cookware shops I got two ties go too Thai it just forces all that stuffing out of the Lamb when it's in the oven nice now I want to season the top of it roll the joint to make sure all the skin gets seasoned now you think normally that just goes in the oven like that that's how my mum would do it but get your tray onto the gas oil in get it really nicely colored none of your stuffing's coming out of the sides really important look at that color beautiful it does kick start the roasting process gas off into the oven cook for 45 to 55 minutes depending on how pink you want your lamb lift the lamb out of the fat to rest resting it raised up in the tin will stop it cooking but not cool it down too quickly that means you won't lose any of those lovely juices next I'm making a simple but sophisticated accompaniment for the lamb top and tell the Cucumber peel it cut the Cucumber into three and just core taking out all that it's just sort of watery seedium it spoils the flavor slice the Cucumber cucumber in really nice way of making a cheap and cheerful cucumber look at the Hammers we're going to dress that cucumber with a nice fresh yoghurt a couple of tablespoons next some fresh mint dress it touch of salt Touch of pepper and then pomegranate molasses that just swings it up finish that with lemon mix that up lamb is rested carefully take off the string and then just gently pull them back straight edge knife that's going to cut through that crispy fat on the outside instantly I tied it purposely so I can guess my portion control from the lines hold it nice and firmly look at your line where the string was and look this one is going to be amazing lay and down just in those two slices there it proves that stuffing Meats is for special occasions because that is a saddle of lamb at its absolute best stuffing meats and fish not only makes them look fantastic it also gives them an extra added flavor Dimension too once you've mastered the technique you'll be able to turn out dishes that will guarantee you'll have an unforgettable Feast here are three more of my favorite easy stuff dishes that are perfect for any Feast first up chicken with garlic and Chestnut stuffing packed with flavor and earthy richness for the stuffing before I finely chopped onion garlic and celery in hot olive oil next add pine nuts which have a lovely creamy taste and chopped earthy cooked chestnuts both add a wonderfully chewy texture and richness to stuffings season and add chopped parsley [Music] then stirring cooked wild rice next take a whole deboned chicken it's fiddly to do at home but if you ask your butcher will do it for you and pile the stuffing mixture along the center now simply roll the chicken up tightly and tie it with your butcher's string then roast in a hot oven for just over an hour simply carve into magnificent thick slices so impressive so easy and trust me this is a dish guaranteed to get a fantastic reaction on any occasion holster fish will always make an impression my next recipe is the bass stuffed with fennel lemon and capers first place a whole gutted sea bass on foil and season the fish inside and out sea bass is known as the king of the Seas and has a wonderful sweet white flesh start the stuffing with sliced fennel its aniseed flavor works brilliantly with the fish next add Capers fresh dill slices of lemon then dot in knobs of butter lastly add a splash of white wine which helps to steam the fish and creates a lovely sauce and seal tightly into a parcel this locks in all the juices and flavor then simply bake in a medium oven unwrap and hear your guess ooh and R with delight prepared in 10 minutes wrap for intense flavor a stunning sea bass that's bound to create a stir [Music] my next dish throws a Spanish Twist on a classic English roast pork stuffed with Manchego and menbrillo use a pork loin roasting joint lay the joints skin side down and cut and cut three quarters of the way into the flesh creating space for the stuffing next thinly slice Spanish Manchego cheese this has a wonderful buttery nutty taste and is fantastic for stuffing as it melts brilliantly slice Spanish umbrella Queen's jelly sweet and perfumed is the perfect partner for the saltiness of the cheese then simply layer your cheese and Quince jelly into the pork add Sage leaves for a strong and deliciously bitter flavor roll the meat up and tie with butcher's string next add more Sage leaves and some aromatic fresh thyme to a roasting tin then lay the pork on top skin Side Up cut a bulb of garlic in half and wedge it under the meat the garlic wedges help lit the pour so it roast to Perfection and will add a sweet depth or flavor to your gravy drizzle with olive oil season and roast for just over an hour with the heat on high for the first 20 which helps get the skin

easy ballito misto a classic Italian mixed meat dish [Music] I'm starting with some Italian fennel sausages [Music] fry them until colored making sure all sides are nicely browned set them aside then slice chorizo a spicy Spanish sausage with a wonderful Smoky taste and Fries so releases all its incredible flavor [Music] next chop carrots celery garlic and add to the same pan this keeps in all the

crumble over some creamy feta cheese preparation but slow cook for maximum flavor aubergines like you've never tasted before one more dish that uses time to transform a humble ingredient is perfect slow cooked beef foreign [Music] start by frying the beef Shin in hot oil seasoning as you go it's a very economical cut of beef as it slow Cooks it also makes the most delicious gravy as the marrow thickens and flavors the sauce [Music] the same pan saute chopped carrots peeled whole shallots sliced celery peeled and chopped ginger and garlic next add tomato puree and cook for a few minutes [Music] add the shin back into the pan with a glass of dry white wine and the juice of an orange this deglazes the pan adding incredible depth of flavor [Music] pour in chicken stock season and simmer for an hour and 20 minutes brilliant finish with gremolata a dry Italian salsa made with chopped herbs simply chop parsley and garlic together and mix in the zest of an orange or lemon when the beef is cooked Rich anxious and beautifully tender scatter over the lovely fresh gremolata simple satisfying and crammed full of wonderful taste and textures delicious fast to prepare cheap and easy to make slow cooked to Perfection three amazing dishes I guarantee you'll make time and time again [Music] this is my Essential guide to kitchen equipment everything you need to know about the basic kit that will get you cooking fantastic food casserole dish absolutely essential when it comes to good home cooking why so versatile the beauty of this thing is the fact that you can actually use it on the hob or start it on the hob and finish in the oven more importantly cast iron it conducts the heat so you can have the gas on absolute minimal or the oven down to its absolute lowest setting and the thing will just cook naturally casserole dishes are surprisingly versatile and a great investment you only need one and if you look after it it'll last you a lifetime brilliant for one pot wonders welcome back to my ultimate cookery course I'm teaching you my slow cooked favorites my guide to getting the best value from your butchers one of the biggest bills in the kitchen is going to be for meat so it's crucial you keep costs down but that doesn't mean sacrificing flavor especially when you use some slow cooking magic to get the best from cheap cuts to get value for money it always pays to ask an expert and fifth generation award-winning Master butcher Danny lidgate is a man in the know one of the great things about going to a butcher is they're going to have more Cuts available than most supermarkets so you're going to see things that people don't know about so one example might be the beef ribs a great product for slow cooking in the oven especially cooking on the bone you're going to get more flavors from the bone there's some really nice pieces of Juicy meat these only used for mince in the past now people are using it for braising or slow braising or even barbecuing it with some really nice marinades the oxtail are less popular now than maybe they used to be small little mussels make up the tail once that's slow cooked they all fall apart really tender juicy Meats also oxtail is Sublime en stews curries and soups another great cheap cut for slow cooking is one you saw me using earlier Lamb's breast [Music] is one of the least expensive cuts of lamb and it's also delicious slow roasted or stewed here we have the shin of beef you can see in the sheds made up lots of little different mussels these are always moving always doing work so slow cooking will give the best end results it's going to have fashion a little bit but it should be enjoyed by everybody it's a fantastic piece of meat here we have some ox cheeks and when they're trimmed you end up with a really lean piece of meat obviously with the cheek the cow's always eating munching on grass this means I need a lot of cooking but essentially it's a really nice healthy lean piece of meat with fantastic flavors oxchicks also make an incredible ravioli or Ragu and if you're a pork lover why not try pork neck it's a succulent alternative for a slow Sunday roast here we have a muscle from the shoulder it's called feather blades the reason it's called feather blade is because when it's cut each piece looks like a feather the gristle tends to be slow cooked and the more it's cooked we'll turn gelatinous giving a lovely jelly and juicy liquid to the meat fantastic for casserole pies and stews there are so many cheaper cuts which are brilliant for home cooking it's important with all these forgotten cuts to find out how to cook them don't be scared of them they're really economic but full of flavor and the end result is fantastic meal as a chef one of the biggest kicks I get is taking an ingredient that doesn't cost much and turning into something that looks and tastes like a million bucks my next recipe turns what used to be a decidedly unfashionable cut of meat into the star of the dish fit to Grace any table slow roasted pork belly with fennel slow roasting works better on fattier tougher and unfashionable cuts whether it's a cheek or even a neck or this amazing pork belly it's a fantastic way to transform cheap cuts into amazing melting perfection take a very sharp knife bring the pork belly towards you so you're over it you've got all that pressure and weight using the tip of the knife I'm just sort of nicking it I go across the pork belly long strokes with a knife take your time turn it 180 this time what we're doing is just sort of cutting those nice little sort of diamonds but as that starts roasting on top it starts to get nice and crispy take your handfuls of salt and just sort of rub it in bend it over and then all those cracks really helps to get a nice crisp crackling on top roasting tray getting really nice and hot take a hole over fennel to intensify flavor and to keep the meat succulent I'm braising my pork belly with strong vibrant spices and vegetables crush and peel three whole cloves of garlic and add to the fennel olive oil in fennel in I like the nice strong aniseed flavor that goes with that nice rich dense pork fennel seeds delicious Taiwanese in and just a couple of cardamom seeds and wow they're like little bangers like little firecrackers incredible lovely fresh bay leaves get your pork skin side down just sear the top of that fat that locks in all that amazing flavor then I'm gonna flip it over and get it nice and crispy and then on fennel seeds embedded in those little cracks now some white wine the minute that white wine hits that pan you can just smell that light fragrance and the fennel allow the wine to Bubble away and reduce until the alcohol is burnt off sometimes at the stock NOW the stock goes in just underneath the skin so it roasts on top all that meat under there it's gonna be submerged because what happens in the oven the top goes crispy as anything and the stock reduces and braises at the same time really importantly bring that back up to the ball before it goes in the oven otherwise it will never boil never go up to temperature smells incredible slow roasted pork belly at 180 degrees for two and a half hours [Music] look at that you've got that nice crispy skin on top you can see how much of the stock has evaporated put that onto the board it looks stunning to make a delicious rustic sauce with the flavor packed contents of the roasting tray first get rid of the excess fat take a couple of slices of bread it's like a perfect sponge because you just lay that on top and drag it almost like a net and it just absorbs all that fat if you want the perfect fried bread trust me stick that in a frying pan a nice teaspoon of mustard whisk that in and then simply simmer for a few minutes before pouring into a serving jug with your pork belly always use a nice serrated edge knife you can hear that wow that is amazing incredibly tender that belly of pork is gonna almost melt in your mouth you've got that sweet meat under that crispy belly of pork what an amazing way to cook a very cheap cut of meat [Music] foreign [Music] kitchen tips first how to make a fantastic chicken stock a classic slow cook recipe that gets amazing flavor from simple ingredients chicken stock ingredient to good cooking it trans sources it's a fantastic base for Soups and more importantly it's so easy to do a little bit of love and care at the beginning and it Cooks itself right step one chicken carcass into a pie sided pan an onion does need to be finely chopped the vegetables flavor the stock onion in then from there cut your leek into nice big solid chunks roughly same size as the onion silver vegetables cook at the same time and then add carrots celery and garlic and then a nice sprig of thyme that helps to really give depth of flavor to the chicken stock a couple of bay leaves and some fresh parsley and then peppercorns pan and just lightly crush them and a little pinch of salt and now just cover the vegetables and the carcass with cold water just cover the chicken and the vegetables bring it up to the ball as quick as you can now as it comes into the boil a really nice skin take the base of a ladle and swirl that around that pushes all the grease and the impurities to the side of the pan then get your Laden and just tilt it if you don't skim all that off the stock becomes very cloudy people's impression of cooking stock then it needs to cook for three four hours at a time this is one chicken carcass let that boil away gently for 30 to 40 minutes maximum we're gonna pass it off let's take a sieve place that over the pan and then just pour that in it smells amazing it's aromatic the color is absolutely beautiful from there you have the most amazing stock when you need to season meat in flour a great tip is to place it in a plastic bag to dust it evenly using flour also helps the sauce to get nice and thick during cooking when Browning meat fry in small batches don't crowd the pan otherwise it won't sear or color properly when slow roasting meat line the bottom of the roasting tray with chunky vegetables like onions fennel and carrots they act as a trivet to keep the meat from boiling in its own juices plus the veg can be the base for your gravy later on after slow cooking baked on residue can be tough to remove but if

Pre-order your copy of Ramsay in 10 here -...",2022-12-03 22:16:02.926159, adding a glazed ham to your holiday menu is a great way to get ahead it's delicious versatile and the ultimate dish to have in the fridge for any hungry guests who drop by Christmas would never be the same without a beautiful delicious honey glazed ham across that long Christmas period this can get you out of jail quite easily ham salads ham sandwiches Hamburg and chips the is a Gammon what we can do now is cook it so it becomes a ham in Japan first things first the water cover it completely so the whole Gammon Cooks evenly the important part now is adding flavor in there carrots in the leaks the more veg in there now the more fragrant the broth becomes once the ham is cooked that stock is extraordinary the base to a fantastic soup onion not finely chopped and in homemade hamstock is packed with flavor so it's great for making soups sauces stews and risottos plus it can be frozen so it's there when you need it pan down peppercorns lightly Crush then to give their Christmas flavor I'm adding crushed coriander seeds two cinnamon sticks and four aromatic bay leaves up to the boil and then turn it down let it simmer and then skim it cooking a ham isn't hard but it does take time this two kilo joint takes two and a half hours to simmer before it's glazed and baked however it is worth it because it tastes absolutely delicious so the glaze very very simple Demerara sugar Madeira that sweetens the glaze basically a 45 wine a couple of tablespoons in and then show vinegar again couple of tablespoons honey in nice bring that up to the ball the longer you leave it on the stove the darker it becomes you want your hand really nice and dark then cook out the glaze for three four minutes that I'm happy with lovely right the gammon's cooked now onto the plate carefully snip the string nice and gently peel back get rid of the skin then crisscross it don't push too deep let the knife do the work stud it close [Music] look at it almost looks like an albino pineapple the glaze and just carefully cover start in the middle and let it work round oh God gently gently gently gently it's not even roasted yet and it looks amazing beautiful look at that half the glaze over now into the oven 15 minutes I started to color look at the rest of the glaze and pour that over look at it wow the more effort passion and love you show the ham now the results are tenfold look at it every five minutes out of the oven and glaze again I'm back in the oven now a 190 degrees we're going to baste and roast for 35 minutes delicious next I'm going to make a pear and saffron Chutney this is a fruity relish that works brilliantly with a sweet aromatic ham First Things First Slice the onion [Music] fry the chopped onion in olive oil without coloring it the important part about this stage is the fact that we're going to layer the chutney with textures from onion to Apple to pear a nice little block of Ginger grating the ginger so the ginger sort of disappears with the onions then add the spices a good grating of nutmeg followed by a teaspoon of cinnamon and a teaspoon of cayenne pepper to give it a kick delicious I recently spent a lot of time in India where chutneys originated and discovered that whereas the British style chutneys tend to be cooked and are usually quite sweet Indian ones are normally fresh spicier and quite sour next Demerara sugar once that Sugar's dissolved the white wine vinegar all in that's going to give you this really nice sort of sweet and sour flavor from there our fruit these are Williams pairs per is the star of the Chutney so keep it quite rustic next add chopped cooking apples their tanus gives a lovely contrast to the sweetness of the pears to give it great texture a handful of sultanas paint your saffron this gives it a really nice depth a rich golden color saffron is the world's most expensive spice it's made from the dried stigmas of the saffron crocus flower and as a general rule of thumb the deeper the color of the threads the better the quality and to make it lighter the zest and juice of two oranges the orange and the saffron go brilliantly well together just squeeze that in there This chutney's brilliant with ham fantastic in sellers but equally as delicious with fish whether it's a roasted Cod a grilled fillet of mackerel it goes brilliantly well bring it up to the ball cook that out for 15 minutes now Tomatoes going at the end and that brings a certain amount of freshness to Chutney really helps to give it that nice texture [Music] mix that in literally cooking cooking in 30 seconds [Music] what's great about this Chutney is that as it matures its flavor gets better and better and it will keep for up to six months fill up the jar and that is going to deliver amazing flavor across Christmas and look my goodness me that is Fit For A King foreign [Music] listen I need some help okay we're gonna make the most amazing pumpkin soup Phil That's Heavy it's very heavy but it is going to be absolutely delicious right and I can always tell okay if it's ripe a little bang on there what does that sound like um drums that's right and if you push your thumb in there just a little bit of soft right at the bottom of the root right first of all I'm going to cut it in half and very carefully just cut through I'm using a French pumpkin but these versatile vegetables come in all shapes and sizes and colors at this time of year their nutty sweetness is ideal for warming soups curries and roasts wait and see what happens when we open this up wow oh right Holly that's for you now this is where it's going to get a little bit gory okay you get your hands and you scrape the seeds out but this is getting messy rub them together and just give them a little clean nice and gently good yeah nice look at that what do you mean yuck come on Holly that's it into the water now once the seeds are out we're going to toast them in the oven as a little snack so this is a really nice way I'm not wasting anything get your fingers right in there Tilly there you go [Music] once the pumpkin seeds are out score the flesh to help it roast and absorb flavor season and had a generous amount of Rosemary take the garlic rub around the outside so perfumes the inside then add a large glug of olive oil and as a garlic roast with a rosemary it's sweet almost buttery nutty taste or mellow and flavor the pumpkin all the seeds done yeah almost good after the pumpkin seeds have been cleaned dry and season them ready for the oven and

the side okay yep scooping out well they're lovely roast pumpkin we don't waste anything you hear that skin all into the center roasting a pumpkin intensifies the rich sweet flavor of its flesh which is lovely for Soups but also great as a filling for ravioli or making a delicious Mash with butter nutmeg and salt and pepper that's the pumpkin dump now what we need to do is get these mushrooms here and just peel them lengthways okay onto the plate again I'll get my onion chopped olive oil in okay yeah nice and generous with olive oil because I want this soup do really nice and velvety onions in

#GordonRamsay #Cooking #Thanksgiving...",2022-12-03 22:16:02.926159, my caramelized cranberry apple sauce is another recipe I always cook a day in advance it packs a wonderful punch that really lifts the subtle flavor of the turkey it's simple to make and with its deep red vibrant color looks fantastic on the plate the secret behind any good Christmas is in the organization and the preparation anything can get done in advance do it apple and cranberry sauce is a prime example first things first we're gonna make a really nice caramel sugar in at 150 grams of caster sugar to a pan followed by a couple of star anise that helps to really give a nice sort of aniseed flavor to The Cranberries next lightly crushed four cardamom pods this has a lovely warm Spicy Sweet flavor then wait for the sugar to melt and form a caramel really important to have the confidence now to color that caramel so it gets really nice and dark before putting the Cranberries in [Music] [Applause] [Music] wow smell of that caramel is amazing now cranberries in crumb is a very tart and acidic but balanced with the sweetness of the caramel and apples they give the sauce a lovely dry sharp note to tell if they're fresh drop them on a hard surface the higher they bounce the fresher they are the secret now is for the caramel to blister the cranberries and really start to break that down smells fantastic next core peel and thinly sliced two apples and once the sauce is finished it really just helps to sort of wake up flavor of the turkey Now The Cranberries are starting to break down Apple in smells fantastic salt and pepper really important really helps to balance that tartness against the acidity of the Apple salt and pepper really brings it back the smell is fantastic it's a sort of sweet sour spicy nice now from there delays the pan with a touch of port around the side deglazing dissolves all the lovely sticky caramelized bits of food that are stuck to the pan and incorporates them into the sauce next add the zest of an orange [Music] and for another layer of fragrance sweetness squeezing the juice lovely then cook on a low heat for five to ten minutes to thicken but remember the salt will become even thicker once it's cooled down now that is the right texture I don't want a runny sauce I want something really nice and thick delicious packed full of flavor perfect if you really want to get ahead this sauce can be made three or four days in advance and kept in the fridge which allows the flavors to develop even more smoked salmon scrambled egg and croissant it's Rich some just an incredibly easy to do first the croissants slice them into rounds and season them lightly with salt and pepper the secret behind a really good breakfast is in the timing on the quesles on first smoke salmon on top and then the scrambled egg put the croissants in a dry pan and toast you don't need oil because the castles have a lot of butter in them this is a great way to transform day old croissants giving them a delicious new life and just start to see them toasted almost listening in the pan and that's the butter inside that smell is amazing it almost smells like a sort of caramelized waffle absolutely delicious toast them all around both sides and then out next just get the smoked salmon and sort of twist it and let it fall over the castle let it sit naturally on top of the toasted croissant scrambled eggs eggs into the pan never whip up the eggs beforehand you break down the egg too much what I want is a really nice rich creamy scrambled egg eggs in no seasoning at this stage a nice generous knob of butter now from there onto the Heat and all we're going to do now is Stir and stir and stir foreign texture to the eggs it looks rich delicious Sumptuous luxurious to be very careful making scrambled egg all of a sudden it looks runny and within 30 seconds it's cooked working it all the time right after stirring I plastic scraper in there take the pan off the heat and just work around the pan cleaning up all that scrambled egg that's sticking to the bottom and now look we're getting that really nice sort of creamy beautiful texture a little touch of butter in there now I'm going to start with the seasoning 30 seconds from the end salt pepper back on to the stove and a tablespoon of cream the cream actually stops the scrambled egg from overcooking cream in and then fold that in there now keep that off the heat but look at it look at that color peaceful and then finally some fresh chives there's a Ramsey classic smoked salmon toasted croissant and a delicious scrambled egg [Music] we're gonna make an amazing butter and this is sort of the start of the the most important part keeping that bird incredibly moist soft butter a touch of salt and pepper [Music] it'll touch up olive oil in there that stops the butter from burning next add the zest of two lemons and their juice this gives the flavor butter a wonderful Citrus thing [Music] three cloves of garlic turkey is a very delicate dainty meat and that's why I want the garlic pureed so it sort of disintegrates and flavors a turkey gently without becoming too overpowering then add a generous handful of chopped parsley wow that smells incredibly light give that a good mix turkey's a very very very lean bird and it dries out so so important to make sure that we help it to cook perfectly butter done now prepare the turkey we'll season the bird inside the cavity [Music] salt and pepper next half two onions and pop them in as they roast they steam inside the bird giving it a lovely sweetness put in the lemon and a couple of bay leaves for their Bittersweet spicy flavor we're sort of lining the inside of the turkey with these fantastic sort of flavors you can see the bird is upright and it's looking sort of like it's standing to attention now it's time to add the flavored butter just very very carefully open up the skin go through over the back of the breast and keep the skin intact the idea is to gently loosen the skin with your fingers so the butter can be stuffed underneath it now once you've loosened all the skin off the top of the thighs turn the bird around and just go through here again hand up and just release a little bit but don't completely break it because I don't want all that butter to run out right from there now take your butter put it into a ball smells amazing lemony citrusy and just sort of flatten it stick that in there underneath one side now once you've got it in there pull back the skin and just use that to sort of slide all the way down what we want to do now is line the top of the breast with all that butter there that butter is going to keep the turkey breast really seriously moist turn the bird around and finish covering the breasts with the butter turkey's originally came from North America and their best young and plump my favorite breed for Christmas is either Norfolk black or Norfolk bronze both of which have a wonderful gamey taste take the rest of the butter and carefully massage over the breasts legs and wings can do all this the night before and simply cover the turkey with tinfoil and keep it in the fridge ready to be cooked on Christmas Day into the tray [Music] and it will touch of olive oil now olive oil on top again that protects it gets that skin really nice and crispy and it stops the butter from burning now in the oven at 220 for 10 minutes get really nice and brown quickly in she goes beautiful [Music] [Applause] [Music] that smells fantastic after 10 minutes take the turkey out of the oven and baste then cover the breasts with smoked streaky bacon what I want to do is add a little bit more flavor I'm already starting to think about my gravy so the bacon protects it stops it from drying out but it's going to start to really give my gravy a wonderful base turn down the oven to 180 degrees this five kilogram bird will feed eight people comfortably it needs roasting for two and a half hours or half an hour per kilo basting every so often back in and now she's on the way look at that beautiful as pretty as the Christmas tree that smells fantastic wow look at that beautiful that is 90 of your work done there to test the turkey is cooked stick a knife into the bottom of the thigh and if the juices run clear it's done the secret now is to let the turkey rest uncovered for two and a half hours as the meat relaxes it reabsorbs its juices making it succulent and tender plus it'll be easier to carve it might seem like a long time to let it rest but remember the turkey doesn't need to be piping hot because I'm serving it with hot gravy that looks like a million dollars let that rest because the flavor will be 10 times more exciting once it's rested the key to pulling all the different elements of your Christmas dinner together on the plate is the gravy my recipe for turkey gravy made with cider and walnuts has a wonderful Appley nutty flavor which beautifully complements the turkey meat and fruity pork stuffing as that turkey is resting I want to make the most amazing gravy and when I say amazing I really do mean amazing drain the excess fat from The Roasting tray and put it back on the heat then remove the bacon from the top of the turkey and the roasted onions from the cavity look at them my God they smell amazing finally take out the roasted lemon first of all cut up the bacon lovely bacon into the tray there are crispy that is that's the start of our gravy the onion look at it beautiful it doesn't get any better than that chop that up onion and bacon in that smells incredible when I first got the chance to cook Christmas lunch for the chefs in Paris they taught me one crucial thing I was only 21 at the time but they made me rest the turkey as long as I cooked it so I cooked it for three hours and I rested it for three hours what a difference incredible next chop up the roasted lemon and add to the tray put in a couple of sprigs of rosemary to give it a lovely aromatic punch and Fry then add three chopped tomatoes which helps to thicken the gravy and give it a lovely fresh taste it's time to really get the turkey flavor into the gravy snap off the wing take off all your little trimmings some of these little bits here add that into your gravy these are the bits we never use everyone throws them away off there that little baby there take him off I want that bang flavor delicious try that off the smell is incredible next pour in the dry cider this adds a lovely subtle Apple flavor that really lifts the taste of the turkey meat as The Cider starts to reduce pour in the delicious resting juices from the roasted turkey wow there you go the most amazing flavor foreign has reduced by half crush the vegetables and the turkey pieces with a Masher to extract the maximum amount of flavor and basically what's happening now is that we're giving the gravy a little bit of body pour in the chicken stock and reduce again then now a little taste [Music] wow let me just close your eyes and wow it oozes flavor and turkey now sieve it back of the ladle to push it through the sieve extracting every last drop of flavor pop in a sprig of rosemary and leave to infuse ready for the finishing touch simply add crushed walnuts to the bottom of the gravy boat and ladle in the hot gravy

stylish than my next dish wonderful baked cheesecake for me food always has to be impressive but when it comes to desserts often you see Sponge sugar or wild decorations remember simple is always the most impressive this cheesecake is so straightforward yet so delicious well cream cheese leave it out of the fridge for five or ten minutes go nice and soft trust me your arms will be thanking you sugar in this cheesecake is a New York cheesecake because it's baked so there's no base start creaming the cheese and the sugar spending the amount of time I do in the states if there's one thing they know how to do out there is the most amazing impressive cheesecake Rich delicious but so simple work the bowl lift the ball to your advantage really whisk whisk whisk whisk lovely creamy now get your eggs add the extra mixture bit by bit doing it this way it's more efficient hey you're incorporating a lot of Air B the mixture doesn't separate Blaster of your egg of course you can use electric mixer but if I go to the gym we can just make a cheesecake a day cheesecake a day keep the Bingo Wings away now a couple tablespoons of flour give it a whisk stop something going Lumpy now I want to scent that cheesecake I've got the freshness zest the lemon in there I want to sort of tart it up even more fold in some fresh raspberries sort of just mix them through be careful to crush them then grease a cake tin with butter this will ensure your cheesecake slides out beautifully get your mix let that fall in now take your cake tin and just tap it mixture hits the bottom of the cake tin The Raspberries rise and you've got raspberries at the top the middle and the bottom it also stops all those little pockets of air trapping underneath the mixture and the cake tin there's no holes in the cheesecake now into the oven 180 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes [Music] hmm slightly soufflaid up pull off [Music] that's the color I wanted on top and look at it it's one of the simplest yet the most stylish cheesecakes anywhere beautiful [Music] to keep old dishes fresh and exciting it's great to get spicy my next recipe is a time-honored British classic but with addition of spices it's given a new lease of Life fragrant spice rice pudding I love cooking with spices but you don't have to just cook Savory dishes using aromatics and spices across desserts takes your puddings to a completely different level [Music] first off as spices this is a fresh vanilla pot fragrant and packed full of flavor use the back of the knife and flatten it that removes all those little seeds off the skin of the vanilla pod take your knife slice down the middle and then when you open that up the smell is incredible take the tip of the knife and you scrape inside and look all those seeds dying to come out that is incredible there are thousands of seeds still ingrained to the Pod so put them in to the casserole cardamom powerful spicy say two little pods place your knife on top and lightly crack them cracking the cardamom pods helps release all the amazing flavor cloves because of that kind of aniseed flavor with a lot of depth one two three cinnamon stick snap and in just smelling that level of fragrance you can imagine what the rice pudding is going to taste of turn on the heat lightly toast those spices just a couple of seconds and what's going to happen is just going to sort of enhance those spices in a way that it just draws out an even more powerful fragrance coconut milk in sugar two tablespoons milk and then a couple of tablespoons of cream bring it slowly to the boil to allow the flavors to infuse and this rice pudding reminds me of my time in India where I got really into that chai tea fragrance because it was just so delicious and so comforting take a lime in the lime just cuts through the richness of the coconut gives it that nice little bit of acidity goes fantastically well with the cinnamon and that fresh vanilla nice have a taste now let's come up to the boil give it a nice little clean around the outside and in with the rice use 200 grams of pudding rice don't wash it beforehand because the starch helps thicken the rice pudding in the oven and just turn that down to a light simmer and the pudding rice starts to open up and it absorbs all that coconut vanilla cardamom clove and cinnamon bring up to the ball gently and cook it out three to five minutes boiling it rapidly the rice opens up and it goes into mush so we want to keep that nice texture of that sort of fragrant rice pudding on a gentle simmer next a little luxury I'm going to show you how I take this simple delicious aromatic rice pudding to a completely different level here's what I do take two egg yolks separate them now give that a really nice whisk two nice tablespoons of mascarpone cheese whisk that into the egg yolks so it's nice and smooth it's almost like finishing the rice pudding in a delicious custard turn off the gas add that into the rice pudding what happens it starts to enrich and really thicken this rice pudding and takes it to a completely different level the rice is still not cooked started to go nice and soft you can just see how it's opening up but look it's like Rich aromatic lava bubbling away finally great more citrus zest the lime on top roasted caramelized lime zest on top of a rice pudding is phenomenal then put it in the oven for 15 minutes at 200 degrees to finish cooking the rice and develop the intensely aromatic flavors look at that an incredibly fragrant rice pudding how beautiful does that look spices are a brilliant way of helping classic dishes come alive I'll guarantee you'll never ever have had a rice pudding like this before next recipe is a proper British classic that's super simple to cook and costs next to nothing a delicious apple crumble crumbles are the perfect way to use fruit when it's in season there's lots of it about it's nice and cheap but most importantly the fruits at its absolute best foreign make a really nice light caramel pan on nice and low great two apples [Music] and this helps to almost sort of pure the Apple so much quicker there's a lot of flavor in the skin so don't worry about peeling the fruit whether it's pears plums peaches flavors in the skin [Music] start the camera a couple of tablespoons of sugar the sugar helps to get rid of the tartness in the Apple a touch Cinema that starts to make it a little spicy open up your vanilla just scrape out all those seeds now this just makes it light and fragrant all those seeds in to the Sugar We're making caramel be patient and always swirl the dish instead of stirring it when the sugar goes Brown add the Apple starts to sort of cool down the caramel but it gives it a really nice sort of caramelized puree apples almost disintegrating smells incredible turn the gas down slice up two apples it's a crumble That's Got No Frills straight forward no faffing around no peeling on the skin I want them to sort of stand out from the camera apples in now those nice thick chunks of Apple sort of almost bedding itself into the puree dried cranberries gives it that nice sort of shock in the texture sweet and chewy I want it to sort of taste zesty spicy so sit the lemon zest on top of your apples and cranberry fresh lemon juice over and that just gives that extra acidic kick takes the Cranberries the apples the caramel and the cinnamon to another level turn the gas off that says let's concentrate on the crumble flowering a couple of tablespoons of Demerara sugar sugar helps to get the topping nice and crispy butter in give that a nice little rub what we're looking for is like a breadcrumb mixture lightly season it with a touch of cinnamon and the dinner sugar sort of helps to get a nice fine crumble mix and it stops the butter from sort of melting in that flour so that's the basic crumble mix but I'm not finished yet muesli two-thirds crumble one-third muesli mix that in if you haven't got muesli then crunchy granola works brilliantly too lovely now start off in the center work your way around I want the crispiness on the top the puree on the bottom of the caramel and then the texture in the center

locking every last ounce of flavor in that pan and this spicy sausage rice does exactly that [Music] take these spicy sausages and Pierce that skin because I want all that delicious spicy sausage meat out of this casing and you get more flavor from the sausage when you take them out the casing sausage is ready turn on the gas Red Onion less acidic than a big white Spanish onion and a lot more flavoursome tablespoon of olive oil a tablespoon only because I want all that fat coming out the sausages to sort of really help flavor the onions onions in and the onions go in first because you can never Rush cooking an onion it's really important to sort of give them five to six minutes in the pan so you can really start the caramelizing I'm out of my pepper slice around wasting nothing I want to see that sort of little core those tips in the center no fine dice pepper the rice is going to be cooking for 20 minutes so I want the veg to sort of have texture after it's cooked peppers in a bit of garlic two nice cloves just slap down off of the shell the garlic in now we'll turn up the gas get the pan nice and hot because the minute that sausage goes in everything cools down and you'll end up boiling the peppers and the onions and the garlic so heat up to maximum and then just make a well in the center and then now start stirring quickly this is where you get so much more bang for your buck out of sausages because the Skin's off and the real flavor of that spicy Italian sausage is gonna come through what's great about this recipe is that you can use any type of sausage to get the flavor and the heat you want I've gone for the spicy Italian but it's just as good with mergys or chorizo a teaspoon Paprika in give it that really nice Smoky flavor rice in and we're going to sort of basically sear the rice we call it in the kitchen blasting the rice where we sort of saute the rice for 30 seconds and it takes on all that flavor next white wine so the wine sort of deglazes the pan and washes all that flavor from the bottom of the pan into the rice stock in bring it up to the boil turn it down and let it simmer double stop to Rice turn that gas down and let it simmer so 12 to 15 minutes just give it the occasional stir keep an eye on it now get ready to finish it sliced spring onions diced sweet juicy tomatoes and roughly chop earthy flat leaf parsley spring onions in tomatoes in off with the gas really important otherwise everything becomes overcooked flat leaf parsley in but look at the volume in that pan now that is an amazing way to take spicy Italian sausages to a completely different level beautiful amazing recipes don't necessarily have to include meat cooking vegetarian dishes will reduce your food bills without compromising on taste and flavor here are three more recipes to satisfy even the keenest carnivore like me that will max out on veg and won't break the bank starting with spicy black beans with feta and avocado [Music] first in a pan heat olive oil add chopped onion and Fry until soft then finely slice garlic and chili add cumin cinnamon and black beans then combined cook together until deliciously soft these small beans come dried or in tins and are a great cheap ingredient to make dishes more substantial to serve dollop the black bean mixture on crunchy tortillas topped with Cube ripe avocado chopped fresh coriander and crumbled salty feta cheese spicy black beans with feta and avocado a dish has filling Frugal and tastes fantastic [Music] my next great veg recipe is leaking Greer rosti with fried eggs [Music] in a hot pan sweat shredded leeks along with a knob of butter and seasoning [Music] great parvoiled potatoes and Greer a hard swiss cheese with a great nutty flavor then combine with the softened leaves in a pan heat oil and a little butter spoon in the potato leek and cheese mix cook gently until golden and crisp underneath then slide onto a plate flip over and return to the pan to finish cooking [Music] finally for the perfect topping fry two eggs and place them on top of the rusty top with fresh tarragon [Music] leaking Greer rosti with fried eggs are simple but substantial dish that makes the most of hearty root veg addition takes as much time to write on a Blackboard as it does to cook chickpea cumin and spinach koftas with tahini dressing [Music] in a blender put tin chickpeas cumin seeds paprika and turmeric and Blitz to a paste [Music] next roll spinach in olive oil and chop finely then add to the chickpea mixture sprinkling gram flour made from finely ground chickpeas then shade golf ball side chunks of the mixture using a spoon and rest in the fridge when ready to cook heat oil in a frying pan shell of fry the copters into golden brown on all sides then rest them on kitchen paper to absorb any excess oil for an easy dipping sauce mix yogurt with a dollar about tahini and a squeeze of lemon then stir in freshly chopped coriander a mouth-watering dish that's perfect for sharing chickpea cumin and spinach coffees with tahini dressing [Music] next recipe is a proper British classic that's super simple to cook and costs next to nothing a delicious apple crumble crumbles

for me the secret of a good frittata is in the sausage nice hot pan onions in getting this on the onions Heat nice and high season fennel seeds forgive the onions a really nice flavor everyone's used to cooking sausages whole but it's a really nice way of using them to take them out of their thin skin what we're going to do is crumple all that wonderful spicy fennel sausage into the onions it's going to release all that flavor a lot quicker pretty important to keep that gas nice and high and the longer you caramelize the sausage the more flavor you're gonna gain six whole eggs give your eggs a really good mix flat leaf parsley a staple in Italian cooking chop it quite rough some Parmesan it gives a really nice seasoning fresh pepper a little touch of salt and then get it in there run your fork through it so when you slice it no one's complaining they've got less sausage I'm gonna make it even more Italian by topping it with some Buffalo mozzarella dry it and then slice it nice and thinly twist it mozzarella in and then finally finish it with that pounds and cheese get the top just as tasty as it is the bottom frittata needs three and a half to four minutes under a red Hot Grill to achieve the best results always ensure your oven or grill are preheated to the perfect temperature this is the thing I love about Italian cooking it's about sharing but always focusing on the ingredients look at that I mean it's incredible a little shake the pan to make sure it comes out and then spatula underneath and just leave it it's light fluffy and it smells incredible and that for me is a dream come true it's amazing how far you can take six eggs and two sausages wow spicy fennel sausage frittata My ultimate Italian breakfast it's a cracking start to the day it's about haddock one of my favorite fish delicious highly sustainable it's packed with protein lightly smoked there's not a Dye smoke there's a big difference so you haven't got that bright yellow tinge so much better next baby spinach the spinach that's very young full of zinc great flavor a little teaspoon volleyball knob of butter that little touch of oil stops the butter from burning it looks like a lot of spinach but it's going to disintegrate almost by two-thirds I'm cooking spinach and butter open up the top of my pepper Mills so the pepper becomes almost like so Cracked Pepper not so fine once your spinach has reduced down by two-thirds add in your cubes of smoked haddock tag them it's got that nice vinegary flavor quite tart pick off the little buds from the stalks keep hold of these and grateful when you're making a tag of vinegar red wine vinegar tag and stalks in chop the tarragon into your creme fraiche little season now grain mustard goes brilliantly well with haddock incredible this mustardy Herby creme fresh will work equally well partnered with grilled chicken the haddock's starting to flake because it's smoked lightly cured it Cooks so quickly you creme fresh now it's almost like the beginning of the perfect fish pie but as opposed to putting pastry on top the eggs are going to bake on top so you've got this wonderful egg crust turn the gas off now crack your eggs around the outside it's a little twist of pepper get the remainder of your creme fresh and put a little dollop in between that adds richness to the egg whites into the oven at 180 for 10 to 12 minutes [Music] whilst the haddock and eggs baked together I can knock up a simple spring onion garnish professional kitchen chefs refuse to use the top of the spring onions but I love that nice dark green flavor it's less harsh than the white the smell of baked mustard you can't beat [Music] that is beautiful spinach was almost melted in with a had it now just sprinkle your spring onions that gives that really nice sharpness wow My ultimate hearty breakfast smoked haddock and spinach baked eggs so packed with protein and iron you'll be raring to dive into the day ahead [Music] absolutely love it why I grew up with it there's something very Scottish about porridge it's that kind of sort of great start to the day my father used to say porridge needs salt and salt only it separates the men from the boys didn't really like it it was insisted salt puts hairs on you I used to sneak a couple of sugar lumps from cafes and put them in my porridge without him watching these days my porridge has much more flavor than just salt it's packed with fruit nuts and spices add vanilla seeds to porridge oats or oatmeal really important just to rub the vanilla through the oatmeal makes it nice and fragrant now a little teaspoon of cinnamon makes it spicier and then nutmeg [Music] already that smells incredible I quite like making this up week at a time and Jack absolutely loves it now whole almonds now if you don't like that kind of crunch running through the porridge you can chop these up or blend them to a powder but I quite like the sort of texture hazelnuts incredibly good a really nice crunch keep your vanilla pot in there as well that just gives it even more lift and of course once it's baked just pull it out instead of sugar I'm adding sweetness with fruit fresh pears and raisins cranberries are great as well chopped apricots as well dried apricots in there dried mango I love dried fruit next pour in a pint of milk and mix this can be done the night before left in the fridge and then a couple of minutes before you go to bake it add your cream into your dish it looks quite liquid but by the time it bakes has this really nice rich crust on top and then just a nice little nutmeg on top now bake at 180 for 30 to 35 minutes then take the porridge out sprinkle on Demerara sugar and Grill to create a sweet Golden Crust a sort of glaze on top beautiful literally for three to four minutes look at that that makes me feel proud to be Scottish because it's perfect for a big Comfort family breakfast it's Rich it's Sumptuous and it's just a humble oatmeal phenomenal especially in the winter my spiced baked porridge with all those nuts and fruit it's a bowl full of love to start the day [Music] foreign

cooking [Music] slow cooking is one of the best weapons in the chess Arsenal not only is it easy it's also an incredible way to transform meat into mouth-waterly melting dishes mastering the art of slow cooking is something every cook should learn first up my phenomenal slow cooked beef short ribs slow cooking is a brilliant way of getting lots of extra depth and intensity into your dishes the secret is to lock in all those flavors at the start and let the ingredients do their thing as it Cooks these are beef short ribs and there's basically five to six bones across there and as the short rib Cooks it sticks to that bone the bone implants flavor and the meat just sort of melts Cooks slowly gives it that nice level intensity slice alongside the bone stray down and see that marbling that sort of disappears and disintegrates I'm cooking them in a roasting tray get it on the heat until nice and hot seasoned beef short ribs beautifully olive oil in both of the top we'll start coloring that in [Music] it's really important to give the big short ribs a really nice Sear if you didn't Brown the meat off it goes in the oven and it looks like boiled meat so you really want that nice dark Rich coloring just cut the garlic in half slide that down the side that's going to give that beef an amazing flavor [Music] to give body to the source stir in a heap teaspoon of tomato puree I'm just hitting the bottom of the pan without tomato puree and we call it cooking out that smell the puree otherwise it just goes in there raw and it gives this sort of tartness to the braised short ribs red wine in don't use an expensive bottle of red wine there's no need bring the wine up to the boil and reduce it this Burns off the alcohol and concentrates the flavor it makes a big difference when you reduce the red wine down by half because it gives that nice dark Rich intensity look at my garlic that is just gonna sweeten everything up incredible stock in beef stock perfect chicken stock fine just to about an inch underneath the beef short ribs bring it up to the ball packing all that flavor as the beef ribs slow cook cover them so they braise from the bottom and steam from the top into the oven two and a half hours 170 to 180 degrees and she goes the great thing about slow cooking is you do most of the work in advance and then put your feet up five or ten minutes before the beef short ribs come out of the oven start your garnish this is light cured pancetta I want nice thick lardons nice big thick sticks of crispy bacon these are delicious Chestnut mushrooms I'm not going to slice them just going to cut them in half look at the color on those loud ones now all the white raw fat have disappeared the larvans have shrunk right down and all we've got there now is the proper bacon mushrooms in beautifully so the mushrooms get seasoned from the bacon I'm pan frying these separately to the beef so they're main crisp another different texture [Music] leave that to cool down now this is like Christmas day for me when you unwrap that fall wait to see what's underneath it [Music] hmm wow smell incredible lift place on your tray beautiful to make a fantastic Rich deep sauce press the soft roasted garlic through a sieve into the cooking juices we're all that nice pureed garlic coming through there because that is going to make the most amazing flavor scrape all that off the sieve nice then just start saving all that lovely braising liquor whoa in that smells delicious take your sauce and just glaze do them individually they deserve that respect spoon on your bacon and your mushrooms beautiful be generous with these mushrooms I'm telling you they taste amazing flat leaf parsley on that freshness over those amazing ribs incredible never ever be embarrassed about going to your Butcher and asking for cheap Cuts because the results are incredible amazing beef braised short ribs with bacon and mushrooms mushrooms are one of my all-time favorite ingredients I use Chestnut mushrooms with the beef short ribs because all of their firm texture and nutty taste but there's a huge range of other mushrooms that are great for slow cooked dishes and when it comes to buying them there's one expert green grocer who's a Fountain of Knowledge Burma Marcus Fred Foster started off on the dead store in primary coat really you had a salad stalk with over 20 years of experience you could actually write his own mushroom encyclopedia mushrooms as soon as you pick them the moisture starts coming out of them so you need to buy them when they're fresh certain products you smell for flavor and they tend to be fruits mushrooms don't smell nice at all they smell kind of metallic really so you have to use your eyes as you guide of what you buy with mushrooms really really important wild mushrooms are literally grown wild in the forests they're just quality wherever they are this is morel mushroom a fantastic products so hard to find in the world it's almost got an apricot type of flavor earthy Woody and of course as you cook it the flavor increases for extra flavor and texture highly prized morels are ideal when added to slow cooked stews and casseroles as are the trumpet de lemur which have a deliciously rich flavor another wild type to try is the chanterelle its subtle fruity flavor is delicious and perfect fried with butter parsley and garlic when you're dealing with wild mushrooms you need to clean them it can be quite a slow process it's with a soft brush don't don't use water never use water with mushrooms it deteriorates the mushroom rapidly oyster mushrooms are very meaty mushroom just a lovely silky smooth flavor really nice how do you tell whether it's fresh those gills are bright never cut a noise the mushroom always tear it look at the whiteness of that beautiful that would be great if it was old although also found wild oyster mushrooms are more commonly cultivated along with similar type the Enoki their delicate taste is grain salads and soups finally Fred saved the best until last and of course the Pinnacle is the Truffle they are really really short after the smell is so intense that smell it's it's hard to describe because it's such a unique smell the more expensive the Truffle the more intense the smell so that's why you use such a small amount on a dish it's amazing the way they get these they used to use pigs of course they don't do that anymore they use Dog Steel because the pig juice to eat them all this magical tasting fungi is by weight one of the most expensive Foods in the world it's phenomenal eating raw shaved over pasta or risottos or drizzle of truffle all Turns Slow cooked stews into something out of this world people are actually scared of mushrooms aren't they so it's amazing really they shouldn't be because take away the fear and just close your eyes and taste them they're just amazing they're they are amazing [Music] cooking all the ingredients in one dish helps to lock in taste and get great flavors working together here are three recipes that turn simple ingredients into amazing dishes first up a fantastically aromatic melt-in-the-mouth treat pork neck curry with mango salsa [Music] for the curry paste add chopped lemongrass chili fresh ginger garlic and Cafe Lime Leaf to a pestle and mortar next put in aromatic ground cinnamon and coriander pinch

[Music] slow cooked for succulents spicy super easy to make and wonderful served with fresh mango salsa pork neck Curry foreign recipe is incredible spicy Szechuan chicken thighs [Music] first marinade the thighs with soy sauce and shouting wine which is made from fermented rice and tastes similar to dry sherry chicken thighs do a lot of work so they need more cooking but cook properly

absolutely delicious very healthy first oven on 200 degrees and then salt pepper now the salt will help to extract the water out of the fat nonstick pan no oil but start the duck breasts in the pan cold skin side down it feels and sounds a little bit weird but if we put them into a cold pan and turn the heat up gradually it starts to release the fat if we put them into a hot pan it seals them in and the fat stays in there we want to render that fat down 90 of that duck breast will be cooked on its skin keeps the duck nice and moist but more importantly it stays crispy once the fat comes out turn the duck over nice high hot heat seal the duck now they're going in the oven skin side down 200 six to eight minutes if your Pan's got a plastic handle it then transfer the duck breast onto a tray but make sure you put the tray into the oven to get hot first cooking duck is like cooking a piece of beef and you can't slice it piping hot all the goodness Runs Out just quickly turn it over push your fingers in there and it's slightly resistant but still quite bouncy and that confirms they're quite pink in the center but the important part now is leaving that to rest let them cool down and then we'll slice them keep that excess duck fats and there you go next time you start taking potatoes you just take them to a completely different level now slicing the duck just slice it at an angle not too thin if you're slightly thinner it goes cold quickly so nice thick slices nice crispy skin on top and a beautiful Clump roasted dark all the white fat gone nice crispy skin and absolutely delicious another slow cooking tip is when slow cooking stews and casseroles fat will rise to the surface to get rid of any excess oils my tip is to remove them with kitchen paper before serving this also works brilliantly on gravies and sauces many great slow cook dishes start by Browning the meat as the meat Cooks lots of flavors get stuck to the pan to get it into your sauce deglaze with wine stock or vinegar never add soft herbs at the beginning of slow cooking they're all too delicate the tip is to add them at the end for that Hill fresh flavor and vibrant color a great tip when frying fish is to always fry skin side down to keep it crispy and always lay the Footers away from you when adding to the pan to prevent hot oil from splashing towards you [Music] foreign cooking isn't exclusive to just Savory dishes it's a clever way to transform fruit into wonderful desserts giving them an amazing sticky Jammy intensity invest a bit of patience and my next recipe pays off big time Indulgence and bursting with flavor caramelized figs with ricotta slow cooking can also take desserts to a whole new level a gentle long cook can really bring out that wonderful Rich sticky sweetness and that depth of flavor in fruits these are black figs they are suited to slow cooking roasting better than the green figs because this outside skin is so durable this is an amazing way of roasting figs and it's so easy yet so delicious lay your figs out in a rows take some Rosemary and just peel that down look at that really nice fragrant stem get your scissors trim the edge almost we've got a bit of a sort of sharp Point bring your three figs together just thread the top of each fig nice and gently Rosemary works wonderfully with sweet dishes as the figs roast in the oven the stock will impart a lovely subtle flavor useful dust the figs with icing sugar then coat them with a generous splash of Blossom with vinegar leave them to sit there for five minutes they sort of marinate I know it sounds odd to use vinegar in your dessert but trust me it gives the dish a fantastic sweet and sour taste I'm going to make a really nice caramel four or five tablespoons of sugar now flatten that out and get it nice and even when the sugar is even caramel Cooks evenly it's changing now you can see it melting from the outside in the one thing you don't do is shake the pan rapidly and sit almost like sort of a lake defrosting and it's hitting to the center it's bubbling it's still not dark enough yet it's getting there turn the gas down and stay in control let the sugar melt until it turns a dark amber color the secret behind any good caramel is just stopping it from overcooking lovely take that off the gas not with butter in there gently whisk in the butter is cooling the camel down you'll see it changing color to like a cafe Olay next add a lug of the balsamic vinegar beautiful for that nice dark richness of a camel a little touch of water in there that way the camel doesn't go too thick now put the camel back on the heat take a fix and sort of place them in gently lovely and then just added all that lovely little marinade don't waste that it's amazing stuff there [Music] icing sugar and Balsam and vinegar so tasty based those figs because the skin gets nice and crispy on the outside and the Fig sort of just absorbs the camel delicious so easy now into the oven 190 for 10 minutes [Music] almost doubled in size now look at the color on them they smell is incredible onto your plate they're a lot heavier because they've actually started absorbing that camera now that's the figs with caramel and serve with ricotta cheese the freshness of that ricotta goes brilliantly well with the figs I'm gonna finish that now it seems zest and then some little nibbed hormones and the rich creamy Jam texture of the Fig with a ricotta brilliant that is an amazing way of slow roasting fruit and taking figs to a completely new level [Music] cookery

required and it's the oven that does all the work my first recipe is packed with strong confident flavors and with the oven taking the strain is a pleasure to make [Music] delicious slow braised stuffed lamb breast one of the secrets to slow cooking is to be robust and really get stuck in big bold flavors work brilliantly well so don't be precious this is gutsy cooking at its absolute best these are lamb breasts are beautiful cheap cuts and they're sort of tucked alongside the rib they've been boned out the skin has been taken off I'm going to roll them stuff them and braise them braising simply means cooking in liquid on a low heat making the meat divinely tender now open them up and give them a really good seasoning season them both sides inside and out really important it doesn't look like a real weighty dense cup of meat but once it's beautifully slow braised it's just like melting lamb it's incredible I'm going to season the breasts with some dried oregano put a heat in there some chili flakes [Music] lemon zest [Applause] amazing salted anchorries in there now they almost melt inside the lamb so the balance of flavors work beautifully now pull it down towards you and roll that nice and tightly that's what I'm looking for a string just need to tie them three times one at each end and one in the middle I fell in love with this dish years ago when I first started working in Paris because we had all the lamb in from the Pyrenees nice thing is they can be done the day before pan on olive oil in look at that oil nice and hot lemon it's really important to get it's a nice color on there whilst they're Browning slice The Onion the Lamb's gonna be cooking for two and a half hours so don't slice the onions too thinly otherwise it'll burn garlic and leave whole got a color on them look at that beautiful take them out onions in and garlic straight in lovely that's the secret about slow braising you never change pans why of all the goodness isn't that one pan a few chili seeds in there argano nice pinch a little bit of lemon in there and I'll do the onions what I did to the lamb [Music] next my capers fry them off get them exploding to the bottom of the pan they get nice and crispy next my black olives now white wine bring that up to the boil deglazing the pan as well a rinse in the bottom of that pan and now the flavor in there it's just extraordinary now where are our tomatoes puncher those plum tomatoes [Music] then simply place the lamb breasts back in the pot and remember to taste [Music] that's nice lid on into the oven 170. two two and a half hours and forget about it whoa beautiful all that was reduced down to this amazing nice tomato sauce and the lamb it's kept its color look at that that's braised beautifully very carefully little bits there it's nice off pull off the little bits of string this is why I get really excited the secret is not to slice it too thinly look at that smell the lemon it's hard to believe when you slice through the center there but that is a very cheap cut of meat on salivating I love this I mean it's just incredible pick up the tomatoes and the olives and the onions and amazing Rich sauce take your lamb sort of just hit it on it looks incredible that for me is why chefs get so excited with cheap Cuts because the end results are incredible delicious breast of lamb with lemon anchovies chili and oregano [Music] slow cooking is a fantastic way to develop delicious deep flavors here are three of my easy one pot wonders minimum preparation long cook and an amazing wonderful taste first up easy ballito misto a classic Italian mixed meat dish [Music] I'm starting with some Italian fennel sausages [Music] fry them until colored making sure all sides are nicely browned set them aside then slice chorizo a spicy Spanish sausage with a wonderful Smoky taste and Fries so releases all its incredible flavor [Music] next chop carrots celery garlic and add to the same pan this keeps in all the flavor stirring the pre-lentals these are excellent for slow cooked dishes because they retain their firm texture and shape next add a bay leaf and some fresh thyme sprigs then the sausages go back in along with chicken stock simmer until the lentils are tender then seasoned to taste [Music] finally sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve simple to prepare a cinch to make and packed full of delicious hearty flavors my Twist on an Italian classic magnificent easy ballito misto [Music] foreign dish is slow cooked aubergine dice the aubergine and fry in hot olive oil until colors on all sides then add a finely sliced onion and chopped garlic cook until tender cooked butter beans and pomegranate molasses which is a sweet thick and glossy Tangy reduction of pomegranate juice season [Music] next add a can of chopped tomatoes bring to a simmer and cook until the aubergine has a gloriously soft and silky texture stir through top mint pile onto toasted bread and finally for a lovely salty Tang crumble over some creamy feta cheese preparation but slow cook for maximum flavor aubergines like you've never tasted before one more dish that uses time to transform a humble ingredient is perfect slow cooked beef foreign [Music] the beef Shin in hot oil seasoning as you go it's a very economical cut of beef as it slow Cooks it also makes the most delicious gravy as the marrow thickens and flavors the sauce [Music] the same pan saute chopped carrots peeled whole shallots sliced celery peeled and chopped ginger and garlic next add tomato puree and cook for a few minutes [Music] add the shin back into the pan with a glass of dry white wine and the juice of an orange this deglazes the pan adding incredible depth of flavor pour in chicken stock season and simmer for an hour and 20 minutes brilliant finish with gremolata a dry Italian salsa made with chopped herbs simply chop parsley and garlic together and mix in the zest of an orange or lemon when the beef is cooked Rich anxious and beautifully tender scatter over the lovely fresh gremolata simple satisfying and crammed full of wonderful taste and textures delicious fast to prepare cheap and easy to make slow cooked to Perfection three amazing dishes I guarantee you'll make time and time again [Music] this is my Essential guide to kitchen equipment everything you need to know about the basic kit that will get you cooking fantastic food casserole dish absolutely essential when it comes to good home cooking why so versatile the beauty of this thing is the fact that you can actually use it on the hob or start it on the hob and finish it in the oven more importantly cast iron it conducts the heat so you can have the gas on absolute minimal or the oven down to its absolute lowest setting and the thing will just cook naturally casserole dishes are surprisingly versatile and a great investment you only need one and if you look after it it'll last you a lifetime brilliant for one pot wonders welcome back to my ultimate cookery course I'm teaching you my slow cooked favorites next up my guide to getting the best value from your butchers one of the biggest bills in the kitchen is going to be for meat so it's crucial you keep costs down but that doesn't mean sacrificing flavor especially when you use some slow cooking magic to get the best from cheap cuts to get value for money it always pays to ask an expert and fifth generation award-winning Master butcher Danny lidgate is a man in the know one of the great things about going to a butcher is they're going to have more Cuts available than most supermarkets so you're going to see things that people don't know about so one example might be the beef ribs a great product for slow cooking the oven basically cooking on the bone you're going to get more flavors from the bone there's some really nice pieces of Juicy meat it's only used for mince in the past now people are using it for braising or slow braising or even barbecuing it with some really nice marinades the oxtail are less popular now than maybe they used to be small little mussels make up the tail once that's slow cooked they all fall apart really tender juicy Meats also oxtail is Sublime en stews curries and soups another great cheap cut for slow cooking is one you saw me using earlier Lamb's breast [Music] is one of the least expensive cuts of lamb and it's also delicious slow roasted or stewed here we have the shin of beef you can see in the sheds made up of lots of little different mussels these are always moving always doing work so slow cooking will give the best end results it's going to have fashion a little bit but it should be enjoyed by everybody it's a fantastic piece of meat here we have some ox cheeks and when they're trimmed you end up with a really lean piece of meat obviously with the cheek the cow's always eating munching on grass this means I need a lot of cooking but essentially it's a really nice healthy lean piece of meat with fantastic flavors oxchicks also make an incredible ravioli or Ragu and if you're a pork lover why not try pork neck it's a succulent alternative for a slow Sunday roast here we have a muscle from the shoulder it's called feather blades the reason it's called feather blade is because when it's cut each piece looks like a feather the gristle tends to be slow cooked and the more it's cooked we'll turn gelatinous giving a lovely jelly and juicy liquid to the meat fantastic for casserole pies and stews there are so many cheaper cuts which are brilliant for home cooking it's important with all these forgotten cuts to find out how to cook them don't be scared of them they're really economic but full of flavor and the end result is fantastic meal as a chef one of the biggest kicks I get is taking an ingredient that doesn't cost much and turning into something that looks and tastes like a million bucks my next recipe turns what used to be a decidedly unfashionable cut of meat into the star of the dish fit to Grace any table slow roasted pork belly with fennel slow roasting works better on fattier tougher and unfashionable cuts whether it's a cheek or even a neck or this amazing pork belly it's a fantastic way to transform cheap cuts into amazing melting perfection take a very sharp knife bring the pork belly towards you so you're over it you've got all that pressure and weight using the tip of the knife I'm just sort of nicking it and go across the pork belly long strokes with a knife take your time turn it 180 this time what we're doing is just sort of cutting those nice little sort of diamonds but as that starts roasting on top it starts getting nice and crispy take your handfuls of salt and just sort of rub it in bend it over and then all those cracks really helps to get a nice crisp crackling on top roasting tray getting really nice and hot take a hole over fennel to intensify flavor and to keep the meat succulent I'm braising my pork belly with strong vibrant spices and vegetables crush and peel three whole cloves of garlic and add to the fennel olive oil in fennel in I like the nice strong aniseed flavor that goes with that nice rich dense pork fennel seeds delicious star anise in and just a couple of cardamom seeds and wow they're like little bangers like little firecrackers incredible lovely fresh bay leaves get your pork skin side down just sear the top of that fat that locks in all that amazing flavor then I'm gonna flip it over and get it nice and crispy and then on fennel seeds embedded in those little cracks now some white wine the minute that white wine hits that pan you can just smell that light fragrance and the fennel allow the wine to Bubble away and reduce until the alcohol is burnt off time to have the stock NOW the stock goes in just underneath the skin so it roasts on top all that meat under there will be submerged because what happens in the oven the top goes crispy as anything and the stock reduces and braises at the same time really importantly bring that back up to the ball before it goes in the oven otherwise it will never boil never go up to temperature smells incredible slow roasted pork belly at 180 degrees for two and a half hours [Music] look at that you've got that nice crispy skin on top you can see how much of the stock has evaporated put that onto the board it looks stunning to make a delicious rustic sauce with the flavor packed contents of the roasting tray first get rid of the excess fat take a couple of slices of bread it's like a perfect sponge because you just lay that on top and drag it almost like a net and it just absorbs all that fat if you want the perfect fried bread trust me stick that in a frying pan a nice teaspoon of mustard whisk that in and then simply simmer for a few minutes before pouring into a serving jug with your pork belly always use a nice serrated edge knife you can hear that oh that is amazing incredibly tender that belly of pork is gonna almost melt in your mouth you've got that sweet meat under that crispy belly of pork what an amazing way to cook a very cheap cut of meat [Music] foreign [Music] kitchen tips first how to make a fantastic chicken stock a classic slow cook recipe that gets amazing flavor from simple ingredients chicken stock ingredient to good cooking it trans forms sources it's a fantastic base for Soups and more importantly it's so easy to do a little bit of love and care at the beginning and it Cooks itself right step one chicken carcass into a pie sided pan an onion does need to be finely chopped the vegetables flavor the stock onion in then from there cut your leek into nice big solid chunks roughly same size as the onion silver vegetables cook at the same time and then add carrots celery and garlic and then a nice sprig of thyme that helps to really give depth of flavor to the chicken stock a couple of Baileys and some fresh parsley and then peppercorns pan and just lightly crush them and a little pinch of salt and now just cover the vegetables and the carcass with cold water just cover the chicken and the vegetables bring it up to the ball as quick as you can now as it comes to the boil a really nice skin take the base of a ladle and swirl that around that pushes all the grease and the impurities to the side of the pan then get your Ladle and just tilt it if you don't skim all that off the stock becomes very cloudy people's impression of cooking stock then it needs to cook for three four hours at a time this is one chicken carcass let that boil away gently for 30 to 40 minutes maximum we're gonna pass it off let's take a sieve place that over the pan and then just pour that in it smells amazing it's aromatic color it's absolutely beautiful and there you have the most amazing stock when you need to season meat in flour a great tip is to place it in a plastic bag to dust it evenly using flour also helps the sauce to get nice and thick during cooking we're Browning meat fry in small batches don't crowd the pan otherwise it won't sear or color properly when slow roasting meat line the bottom of the roasting tray with chunky vegetables like onions fennel and carrots they act as a trivet to keep the meat from boiling in its own juices plus the veg can be the base for your gravy later on after slow cooking baked on residue can be tough to remove but if you boil water in the pan it will dissolve and break down then simply pour out and wash with soap and water [Music] Follow My ultimate cookery course crammed with key lessons top tips and 100

tuna fish cakes who would have thought something as delicious as that can come out of a can a simple supper in minutes that's so mouth-wateringly easy and delicious you're guaranteed to cook it again and again first up pasta with tomatoes and cherries and chilies [Music] foreign [Music] spicy sauce slice anchovies and garlic [Music] dried chilies great for keeping in the cupboard to add a hit of heat on demand [Music] then add the anchovy oil to a hot pan and Fry the chopped ingredients add half cherry tomatoes [Music] chopped black olives and salted Capers cook to combine the flavors in a separate pan boil dry spaghetti another great store cupboard staple when the pasta is tender but still firm drain add to the sauce with a splash of the water it's full of starch which gives a great silky consistency then season with pepper and topped with basil packed with big bold flavors and ready in under 20 minutes pasta with tomatoes anchovy and chillies my next deliciously different chili recipe is grilled corn with Chipotle chili butter [Music] first the topping chopped coriander then add salt and butter soaked Chipotle chilies in hot water these are dried jalapenos which have an amazing Smoky flavor drain and chop [Music] s together and season [Music] next fry corn on the cob in olive oil you want a really wonderfully charred flavor when colored add water to steam through [Music] to eat smother the cobs in the butter and crumble over Lancashire cheese fantastically messy to eat grilled corn with Chipotle chili butter and utterly delicious Smoky treat my final recipe is

[Music] for spice add ground cloves cinnamon nutmeg and allspice season with salt and pepper and combine with olive oil [Music] next score chicken legs so the hot spicy flavors get deep inside the meat rub thoroughly with the jerk mix and marinade add olive oil to a hot dish [Music] Brown the marinated chicken for 10 minutes then add Worcestershire sauce cover and cook in the oven at 220 degrees for 20 minutes [Music] hot spicy jerk chicken easy to make and Finger Licking Good beef tacos with Wasabi Mayo the great thing about street food is anything goes the Only Rule is they've got to be really fast and really tasty now these tacos makes a Mexican and Japanese flavors into a delicious meaty mouthful first off get that pan really nice and hot these are sirloin steaks sear it in the pan with all that fat on I'll add flavor salt and pepper a couple tablespoons of olive oil in pan nice and hot hold of the steak and lay it in always lay away to the panel a little shake and it stops the steak from sticking we're looking for color and if it sticks it's going to burn while the steaks are cooking I can go with my super quick marinade now two tablespoons of me soup paste that's a fermented soybean that gives a really nice sort of Rich sweetness tablespoon of sugar a couple tablespoons rice wine that gives it a really nice fengary kick a couple tablespoons of olive oil salt and pepper I'm looking for a nice sort of thick Rich marinade marinade done it's time to turn the steaks it's all the pan into the other space still based all we're doing every time is just adding more and more flavor take your tongs and sort of lift the steak on its back and really melt all that fat down off with the gas take them out just take your knife see all that fat there just slice that off I don't want any of that now in to the marinade [Music] useful tacos are one of Mexico's most popular Street Foods they've been made from beef poor chicken or fish and are loaded up with amazing sauces and spices now I want something sort of pickly cabbage these are Chinese cabbages slice it in half and look at it really crisp and really tasty I'm going to slice that into quarters and then just shred it and take your time think of cabbage here and you think of sort of braised overcooked cabbage nothing worse but attacker you want freshness a little season of chili flakes they sort of discreetly give it a little bit of heat a little touch of rice wine vinegar if you haven't got that fresh lemon juice small drop of toasted sesame seed oil give that a really good mix now I need something to sort of bring it together we take some Wasabi paste very hot very spicy a sort of thumbnail size I'm going to mix that a couple of tablespoons of mayonnaise give that a really good mix these are basic corn tortilla the trick is to sort of color them and then shape them actually place it on the guest room use some tongs so it's not to burn yourself you can also toast your tacos in a frying pan from there I'm just gonna place it on the rolling pin literally 30 seconds as it cools down the great thing about serving tacos is people can fill them themselves just the way they want

once twice a week I treated myself to the most amazing bold breakfast and it started off with these Beauties here mergys cheap but incredibly tasty start off with a nice hot pan my gaze in it's a very spicy sausage doesn't need any help doesn't need any chili just a touch of salt and pepper you can smell the spice they're starting to release all that wonderful oil that flavor in there add a couple of cloves I'll finely sliced garlic spread the garlic across the pan it instantly changes color takes on this nice dark Rich golden color now take a look with the heat out for the parsley the stalks of soft herbs like parsley and coriander can be used in part flavor during cooking but the leaves should always be added just before serving to give maximum color and fragrance [Music] and then finish that off with my capers myself now take your quest on they're literally 24 hours old so they're crispy on the outside and just slice off the lid this recipe is a great way to use up any leftover croissants from the day before I used to cringe when I saw the French Cooks throw away croissants I used to cry thinking oh my God if you any idea what you're throwing away in terms of flavor whatever you do do not wipe out that pan dunk your croissants mopping up all that amazing flavor and caramelizing the inside for that beautiful don't forget the lids then get your thumbs and go inside the croissant all I want to do now is just create a little pocket and just manipulate the croissant now this is where it gets exciting mix up the Capers the garlic the sausages look at the color all that wonderful delicious flavored oil now some cheese but not just any cheese Fontina cheese is like the number one cheese for grilling and because it's a very rich cheese you shave it thinner than you would a white truffle but it gives a really nice saltiness and a light Smoky flavor Touch of Pepper with salt place these big boys on the tray literally 30 seconds on the grill here we go nice crisp packs full of Flavor now top them and that for me it's almost like being back in Paris except this time I don't have to share them with the French My ultimate big and bold breakfast mergers and Fontina stuff croissants a great way to start the day boiled eggs with a soldier that will make your taste buds stand to attention there's something quite nostalgic about a bald egg it's something that's never lost it's magic when you slice that top off and dunk that Soldier into the yolk you can't mess with a deliciously runny yolk but this is what I like to dunk in it an anchovy Soldier anchovies into pessim water no salt naturally yeah anchovies are very salty so just a touch of pepper rich in Omega-3s the amazing tinned anchovy is a natural flavor enhancer and I use it to Pepper many a Savory dish from roast lamb to the humble toasted Soldier grind them it's a really nice smooth paste the smell of that is almost like being on the seaside now get your soft butter and just put half the butter in first 50 50 is the way 50 anchovy if you send butter that way you've got that real nice salty creaminess mix that up foreign that's absolutely delicious trust me finishing that anchovy butter on a slice of grilled fish I'm in heaven the bread this is a Sourdough delicious very crusty take four nice slices now get that pan nice and hot a couple of tablespoons of that anchovy oil into the pan and then get your bread and lightly fry each side the smell of the anchovy oil is incredible take that out now bring your water up to the boil The Secret of softly boiling an egg is to place them into the water gently on a spoon in and just tilt so they don't hit the bottom nice and Light up to the ball count to five turn the gas down is it four and a half minutes is it five minutes for soft boiled egg I've cooked thousands of them and every time four and a half minutes whilst that's boiling get your bread spread that on there that is incredible chopped parsley brings that kind of freshness goes brilliantly well with the anchovies hear that crunch on in cyber I can't resist oh my God right gas off one Beauty in two I feel like a five-year-old again this is that moment when you open the vault and that little magic inside is all yours there's a great Twist on a great classic wow [Music] perfectly soft boiled eggs with dressed up anchovy butter soldiers of eggs benedict with Crispy Parma ham the secret behind a great eggs benedict is in the hollandaise so get your pan on because I'm going to cook a hollandaise over a rolling boil with a glass bowl butter just put it on to melt three egg yolks separated from the white tarragon vinegar pop that into the eggs if you can't get turkey vinegar any white wine vinegar will do just as long as you've got that acidity in there give some bite to the hollandaise put your bowl over the Rolling Water and just start whisking if the eggs had Direct contact with the gas pollen days will become scrambled egg once you've got that nice creamy texture a nice thick Sauvignon start adding your butter nice and slowly a couple of tablespoons of butter in and give that a really nice mix if you don't whisk it enough the egg yolks don't take the butter it causes it to split it's more butter using a big balloon whisk like this one makes it easier to incorporate air and helps prevent your mixture from separating all the butter in and the best way to keep hollandaise nice and warm is just leave it to sit over that nice warm water bath and it just gives it a really nice room temperature a nice pinch of salt fresh pepper and then fresh lemon juice that just really makes it vibrant exciting and you want to it's like a sort of thick custard I just want it to coat the back of the spoon so it's like you're giving the a nice glossy texture to your beautiful poached egg now as the base for the eggs benedict you cannot beat English muffins but the ham and we'll change I'm going to use the most amazing Parma ham get your pan nice and hot into the pan it's like Posh rashes of bacon beautiful [Music] ham fried nice and crisp though that is incredible beautiful in salads fantastic for eggs Benedict [Music] now keep that pan nice and hot I want all that flavor on the Parma ham left in there and rather than toast my muffins I want to put the muffins into the pan I want them sucking up all that wonderful flavor from that crispy Parma ham make sure your muffins are toasted nicely this will prevent them going soggy later look at that nice and crisp now water on to boil for the eggs nicely seasoned really important and then just a little splash of vinegar in the water that helps the set the egg white in a minute you crack it in while the water heats up in the pan there's time to get organized lay a nice slice of ham on the base now water's brought up to the ball turn it down and then spin your water around like a little whirlpool don't get a little cup so you just drop the cup in hello what happens to the egg gets caught up in the turbulence of the water the secret is not the ball the water rapidly because the strength of the ball can literally explode your egg as they start to move their way up to the top of the water that's a indication that they're cooked take off any excess little bits of egg white and then out onto a piece of tissue paper that just drains off excess water that stops your muffin from going really soggy but look they're like little beautiful mozzarella balls give them a little season left them on to a crispy Parma ham peaceful now get a nice spoon of your hollandaise glaze over try and do it in one glazing over the whole egg when I tell Jack Holly and Megan I'm Matilda that we're cooking eggs benedict for breakfast they bolt down the stairs and let's be honest who wouldn't run to sit in front of those [Music] I don't know a special occasion breakfast that would make anyone feel spoiled eggs benedict with Crispy Parma ham beauties [Music]

a simple slow roast tomato and Watercress salad these cherry tomatoes are perfect if you haven't got cherry tomatoes Vita Tomatoes good or even just big normal plum tomatoes lay the tomatoes on the tray and these go into the oven for about 90 minutes if you turn the oven down really low you can leave them in overnight to be honest the longer you leave them the better they taste once you've seasoned them with salt sprinkle over with some sugar on the salt and sugar combined speeds up the drying process because you want that nice chewy texture and then you get these little thyme flowers and just pick off the buds garlic sliced then just spread that on now the tray looks quite full and compact for 90 minutes in the oven you'll see everything shrink down all the Skins blistering and the flavor intensifies so nicely extra virgin olive oil that gives a nice earthy flavor to the tomatoes place your Tomatoes into an oven preheated to 150 degrees C and cook long and slow for an hour and a half now halloumi cakes there's something quite exciting about halloumi cheese it's a very firm cheese and it fries brilliantly [Music] fill the carrots [Music] great not too finely you want that nice texture next courgette the secret is keeping it all grated the same put that into a sieve a sprinkling of salt will draw out liquid from the vegetables then grate the halloumi halloumi cheese doesn't look that tasty but once you've got color on it in the pan it's really really delicious now really important to squeeze out the excess water from the veg and we'll see all that water that needs to come out of there if we didn't do this it'll make your little patties non-friable because the whole thing starts to separate and then mix in with the cheese spring onions chop up the whites and the greens now we're going to season that with some delicious fresh mint and fresh coriander whenever it's vegetarian I like to put a combination of herbs in there tarragon and parsley minted coriander basil and lemongrass all delicious on their own but in tandem their flavors play off each other next two eggs in give that a little mix add the eggs to the mixture and then finally a couple of tablespoons of breadcrumbs the breadcrumbs help dry out any excess moisture mix all the ingredients together before you start shaping these taste the mixture it's really important to identify the seasoning now if you wait until you've cooked them it'll be too late to adjust the seasoning roll them to a large golf ball shape them it's like a little mini burger you can spice these up with some chili in there if you haven't got fresh chili chili flakes and it's something that can be done up a day in advance to get your cakes firm and ready for frying put them into the fridge uncovered for 25 minutes pan on get that nice and hot boss and wait for that I'll get the dressing ready slice of red chili seeds and all on an angle into shards then chop fresh ginger season with a Sprinkle of sugar and salt add some rice wine vinegar add a couple of tablespoons of olive oil to finish off some chopped coriander [Music] because that's sweet sour spicy flavor with my chili dressing done I can start frying off my halloumi cakes in a hot oiled pan look at that nice crisp Edge you can already start to smell that sauteed halloumi with the courgettes and carrots smells delicious really important for a nice amount of color on them as my cakes Sizzle away I can finish off with my roast tomato salad one of my favorite leaves has to be border Crest it's cut off stalks [Music] foreign s Watercress and shallot they're brilliantly well together shallot looks so dainty when you open up these little ringlets [Music] don't forget to turn your cakes now Tomatoes whatever you don't use just jar them and put them in the fridge [Music] just drop those slow cooked warm Tomatoes over the Watercress the sweetness is incredible absolutely delicious a little drizzle of age of ultimate vinegar gives that tartness to the watercress Watercress is naturally peppery so it doesn't need any pepper just a little touch of salt and then a light sprinkling of extra virgin olive oil after five minutes on a medium heat my halloumi cakes are ready so important to have taken out that water [Music] you can see it doesn't disintegrate and then just get your dressing take a spoon of it

kitchen easier first up how to keep your knife Sharp it's far harder working in the kitchen with a blunt knife than it is with a sharp knife the secret behind keeping a sharp knife sharpen it before and every time you use it first grip the steel feel really comfortable about holding the still imagine you're holding a tennis racket or you're playing squash you've got to be really comfortable with it now 45 degrees confident grip confident grip with a knife this is the butt of the steel really important to keep your fingers behind there you never grip a steel with your fingers over that because the knife comes back in you've just lost a finger always grip behind nice long strokes so we get the whole of the blade over Steel stroke and we start from the bottom to the top so there cross there across slow Strokes over the top of the steel and then come back underneath then back underneath it is so dangerous working in the kitchen with a blunt knife you can cause so much damage working with a sharp knife is 10 times quicker more efficient now that's ready to start chopping stop your chopping board rocking or slipping a great tip is to Simply wet a kitchen cloth kitchen paper or tea towel and place it underneath now you can chop with confidence my next top tip is get the most out of your humble veg peeler it's brilliant for slicing ultra thin ribbons of veg perfect for Asian dishes great for making long delicate parmesan shavings to top soups and salads it also makes wonderful chocolate curls your pepper mill is more versatile than you might think tighten the top screw to get finely ground pepper ideal for Soups and sauces for general seasoning you want it medium ground so set the screw in the middle and loosen it right off for coarse pepper perfect for steaks and fish [Music] peeling garlic for one clove simply bash it with a back of a knife and the skin comes off easily for a whole head Crush separate into a bowl cover and shake hard for about 10 seconds then simply pick out the peeled cloves [Music] this is my ultimate cookery course 100 recipes to stake your life on I'll be showing you a roast chicken recipe to die for hold the drum and slice straight through but first like any good Chef I'm always looking to get great ingredients at the right price my shopping Mantra is simple first rely on your senses make sure whatever you're buying it looks smells and really feels good and if you get the chance taste it before you buy it second is to recognize that knowledge is crucial the more you know about where your ingredients come from and how they produce the better so ask lots of questions and learn you're never too old to learn from experts and when it comes to buying great birds one person knows what to look for is award-winning fifth generation Master butcher Danny lidgate poultry is a great meet because there's many different types of birds it's worth tasting the variation of flavors between different first and first is massive turkey is a great lean meat that's available all year round not just for Christmas anybody who's worried about eating fatty Meats is a really healthy flavoursome meal okay game birds people don't try them often enough once they're shots they're hung up for a little while but a few days at least it means the meat's going to be more tender it all adds in flavor to the birds we've got a wood pigeon and a red leg Partridge both really good and cook really quickly when you're buying a chicken some of the things to look out for is obviously the smell and when you're smelling a good quality chicken you can tell the difference the Skin's a nice white color and it smells like a fresh chickeny smell when you're buying from a good butcher you'll find you tend to get the giblets as well which is basically the neck and other orgas this is great for making gravy once you have cooked it you can use all the off cuts for other things stir fries curries pasta dishes save the bones use the bones for stocks and soups a really packed full of flavor and remember there are lots of different breeds of chicken all have different characteristics and flavors so shop around and find the ones you love here are three of my all-time favorites the label onglay these come from an old British breed they've got smaller breasts but the meat's delicious the black leg a fantastic French variety succulent with bags of flavor and really meaty thighs and the police this is the Rolls-Royce of chickens Rich gamey and delicious one for special occasions I think people should maybe try and buy Less meat but aim for the best quality you're only going to get out what you put in by putting the best quality into a dish you're going to get the best results no matter how season the chef you are there are always new ingredients and recipes to get fired up about so if a tidal recipe is getting you down spice it up with fresh ideas and flavors this recipe is an old classic roast chicken but with a simple twist it takes on a new life and is guaranteed to impress one of the things I love about cooking and that keeps me excited after 25 years behind the stove is that there's always something new to learn every day new ingredients new techniques and new cuisines start off with the stuffing it's amazing how exciting a stuffed roast chicken can be because it keeps the chicken incredibly moist and gives a delicious texture inside the bird I'm going to start off with cured chorizo this is a traditional Spanish sausage and it's garlicky spicy incredibly meaty that gives a little bit of sort of richness to the stuffing get a freezer in start cooking that down and getting all those oils out little touch the olive oil in there to get it going right onions chopped add the onions to the chorizo and in a matter of seconds they'll change color as they soak up all the flavor that lovely spiciness has been stolen from that sausage and now the onions smell incredible garlic garlic in fresh thyme just hold it down and put your fingers on there and it's a really nice way of taking off all those nice fragrant little time flowers you can hear it cracking in the background these are cannellini beans they're waxy very soft and so delicious but very dense but for stuffing they're so robust nothing breaks down drain them off in they're going to take on all that juice as well from this freezer I'm going to season them now because they're very dense so it needs some help and that looks like it's a dish on its own good enough to eat now I want to sweeten things up a little bit Tomatoes half dried in that sweetens up the stuffing beautiful the stuffing's ready look at the color everything Spanish it looks delicious now stuffing the chicken I like taking off these little knuckles as the chicken Cooks the skin stretches over the bone you can get a really nice drum and take off those little wing tips as well salt pepper so important now you're stuffing I want to go right inside the chicken push it down this really helps to cook the bird evenly because you're pushing out all the empty spaces in the carcass and take a nice large Lemon push the lemon in pick up the parcel's nose pull the skin over olive oil on top sauce pepper a teaspoon of paprika sprinkle it on and then get your hands and sort of rub that in and see what the paprika's doing to the chicken putting this like sweet spicy marinade it's not even roasted yet but it looks delicious [Music] 400 ml white wine same quantity of water that helps the chicken to steam Chicken in be generous with the time Sprigs make sure the fall is folded tightly around the roasting tray so the chicken steams in the oven keeping it moist and juicy into the oven [Music] cook for one hour at 180 degrees with a foil on nice take it out and remove the full lid then give it another 30 minutes to crisp up that skin look at that so important to make sure you take that tinfoil off with half an hour to go beautiful Pierce that open squeeze it in that delicious gravy mix that into the tray sieve that that's a really nice fragrant lemony spiced roasting juices to finish before we cut up the chicken take out amazing stuffing [Music] incredible I'd have that with chicken over potatoes any day and then just get your chicken roasting juices now cut the chicken up hold the drum and slice straight through and there's that wonderful drum and the thigh through the wishbone off slice with the point at an angle so you can see the texture of that amazing roast chicken take my cooking juices I just want to give a nice sort of lemony

recipes to take your life on right this is my guide to cooking with spice adding big gutsy flavors using spices at the beginning of cooking and then simply letting the dish slow cook is a brilliant way of getting maximum flavor with minimum effort my first recipe melts in the mouth and because the oven does most of the work it's a cinch to make slow cooked fiery lamb cooking's all about being bold and adventurous and this dish is exciting because it's slowly cooked and the longer it Cooks the more flavor something it becomes marinating the lamb first chilies we're going to use a mixture of red and green take off the tops and just slice in garlic crushed don't worry about chopping these ultra fine just get it in there cooking for up to three hours everything sort of Blends and almost sort of purees itself together smoke paprika goes brilliantly well with the chilies two teaspoons in a touch of dried oregano some little cumin seeds the blend and the fragrance that they give out is extraordinary they release a little oil as well and helps to tenderize the lamb touch of salt pepper cinnamon that sort of sweetens up the lamb olive oil just a tablespoon and the olive oil helps to sort of stick all those wonderful spices to the lamb Chomp in just start really rubbing at this stage you can leave the lamb to marinade for anything from half an hour to overnight allowing the spices to really penetrate the meat giving amazing results when you tuck in delicious vegetables carrots and onions and that's it sliced cigarette slicing vegetables for braising is not getting too thin you slice the onions too thin they burn you've got that horrible Char taste on that slow braised braising it's just a chef's term that means cooking in liquid on a low heat making the meat incredibly moist and beautifully tender so the secret of braising is having a really nice thick durable pan get that nice and hot Touch of olive oil lemon hold the bone because you're in control then into the pan you want that white fat to start rendering so it'll add more fat therefore making it a lot more flavoursome as it braises chillers cinnamon in mix that up and don't be scared you're not burning this you're sort of searing the lamb shanks and this is the important part right at the very beginning we're going to color on the lamb which washes off as it braises in the oven so be generous with that color vegetables in wow and then a couple of Baileys so now you lift the lamb up and get the lamb sat on top of the vegetables now the glaze the pan with red wine the glazing means that you're cleaning the bottom of the pan and you're getting that amazing flavor washed off and lifted up into that sauce it can really transform that dish always delays then bring it to the boil and cook for about 10 minutes to reduce the wines reduced down by half now for the stock bring that stock back up to the ball and then into the oven now don't cover it when you cover it all the condensation comes off the lid your lamb becomes gray all this effort and that exciting spice gets washed away no lid and in the oven for three hours a slow cook on a low heat of 160 degrees gives the spices time to work and transform the meat so it's mouth-waterly tender now look at those out on to a plate you can just see that meat sliding down juicy and creamy tender grab it by the the shank rolling around that rich delicious sauce look at that and get your sauce beautiful let's get some mint don't chop it just pick that fresh mint and let it snow and there you go a very spicy delicious melting in the mouth lamb shank amazing to get the most out of your spices there's only one piece of kit that you need pestle and water I mean they look fantastic and it's essential for any good kitchen these things are so versatile these ancient kitchen tools are perfect for everything from pestos to dressings and cost them around 15 quid use the grind spices and you'll max out on Flavor get perfect textures and always be totally in control make sure you've got a nice large circumference of the bowl so you can grind away the heavier the more durable they are the more confidence it gives you when you're pounding and there's almost a way of confirming homemade hand pounded grab yourself a pestle and mortar and soon you'll be spicing with ease is our brilliant way to add an extra layer and a depth of complexity to any dish learning to use them properly will really improve your cooking here are three more of my super simple spice recipes to get you going [Music] first up a very easy chili and

more stunning recipes that make cooking with spice simple incredible [Music] this is my guide to cooking with spice next up my shopping guide to buying spices [Music] when I buy my spice I only want the best and it always pays to get expert advice Burger has been selling every spice Under the Sun in London's Notting Hill for over 20 years so she really knows what she's talking about I love spices to smell all the texture to color spices are so versatile something very very simple can be really transformed into something really delicious with thousands of aromatic ingredients on a shelf if it smells good she sells it if you're buying spices buy them whole then you can try roast them crying the men you need them and then they will release the essential oils whole spices you can keep for years give them a good bushing wine bottle with your rolling pin or whatever and you see there is still Aroma and you can taste it you smell it then it's fine there's four main spices one is sweet one is sour one is bitter and one is hot this is cinnamon and that is really a great example of a sweet spice when you buy a cinnamon quill like this you have to check that you have loads of different layers in here then you can either grind this or you'd break a piece off I mean this doesn't smell of anything now but if you roll it in your hand just quickly like this and then you smell it again this is just unbelievable if you have spaghetti bolognese put a pinch of cinnamon in it to bring out the flavor this is one of those really special spices sour like a lemon but it has a salty aftertaste I use this anywhere for marinades to salad you haven't left unless you tried it a great example for a bitter spice would actually be a turmeric this is actually a root it grows in the ground like ginger use it very very sparingly about that much well actually color you a curry or a rice dish wonderful yellow watch your fingers you get really yellow fingers from it and then we come to the hot spices one spice that I couldn't miss and that is Hungarian paprika paprika is the powdery form of a bell pepper what makes the Hungarian paprika different is that they actually grow it in Vineyards it's sort of between the vines it has a sweetness and it has a sharpness to it I have it in ice cream I have it on fish I have it everywhere burger spot on about the power of spices to transform dishes where there's Savory or sweet here's my quick guide to the spices I use most spice I couldn't do without always buy a whole and grind yourself so you get the freshest flavor cardamom these pods come in green or black types and have a fantastic Spicy Sweet Taste brilliant for everything from curries to rice dishes and puddings coriander these citrusy seeds are perfect whole in pickles or grind to use in fragrant stews and soups cumin a Savory Spice that's pungent and nutty it's great in marinade for delicious Meat and Fish then cinnamon sweetly fragrant and great with apples or in cakes and Nutmeg warm and spicy it's delicious in a vegetable sauce finely saffron these sweet strands Infuse a brilliant bright red color and are great in risottos and even though it's more expensive than gold a pinch goes a long long way store your spices properly and they'll last for years you keep it airtight in a tin or in a glass chair in your cupboard don't be scared of spices like an aftershave or a perfume you have to select it yourself it has to fit in with your taste and with your kitchen supermarkets and good local shops sell an amazing array of different spices so there's no excuse for not being adventurous be bold find what you like and spice up your cooking like all chefs I love the challenge of transforming classic recipes giving them a new twist to make them modern and vibrant to keep old dishes fresh and exciting it's great to get spicy my next recipe is a time-honored British classic but with addition of spices it's given a new lease of Life fragrant spice rice pudding I love cooking with spices but you don't have to just cook Savory dishes using aromatics and spices across desserts takes your puddings to a completely different level [Music] first off our spices this is a fresh vanilla pod fragrant and packed full of flavor use the back of the knife and flatten it that removes all those little seeds off the skin of the vanilla pod take your knife slice down the middle and then when you open that up the smell is incredible take the tip of the knife and you scrape inside and look at all those seeds dying to come out that is incredible there are thousands of seeds still ingrained to the Pod so put them in to the casserole cardamom powerful spicy take two little pods place your knife on top lightly crack them cracking the cardamom pods helps release all the amazing flavor cloves because of that kind of aniseed flavor with a lot of depth one two three cinnamon stick snap and in just smelling that level of fragrance you can imagine what the rice pudding is in the taste of turn on the heat lightly toast those spices just a couple of seconds and what's going to happen is just going to sort of enhance those spices in a way that it just draws out an even more powerful fragrance coconut milk in sugar two tablespoons milk and then a couple of tablespoons of cream bring it slowly to the boil to allow the flavors to infuse and this rice pudding reminds me of my time in India where I got really into that chai tea fragrance because it was just so delicious and so comforting take a lime in the lime just cuts through the richness of the coconut gives it that nice little bit of acidity goes fantastically well with the cinnamon and that fresh vanilla nice have a taste now let's come up to the boil give it a nice little clean around the outside and in with the rice use 200 grams of pudding rice don't wash it beforehand because the starch helps thicken the rice pudding in the oven and just turn that down to a light simmer and the pudding rice starts to open up and it absorbs all that coconut vanilla cardamom clove and cinnamon bring it to the ball gently and cook it out three to five minutes bullying it rapidly the rice opens up and it goes into mush I want to keep that nice texture of that sort of fragrant rice pudding on a gentle simmer next a little luxury I'm going to show you how I take this simple delicious aromatic rice pudding to a completely different level here's what I do take two egg yolks separating them and give that a really nice whisk two nice tablespoons of mascarpone cheese we started into the egg yolks so it's nice and smooth it's almost like finishing the rice pudding in a delicious custard turn off the gas add that into the rice pudding what happens it starts to enrich and really thicken this rice pudding and takes it to a completely different level the rice is still not cooked started to go nice and soft you can just see how it's opening up but looks like Rich aromatic lava bubbling away finally Great Mall Citrus zest the lime on top roasted caramelized lime zest on top of a rice pudding is phenomenal then put it in the oven for 15 minutes at 200 degrees to finish cooking the rice and develop the intensely aromatic flavors look at that an incredibly fragrant rice pudding how beautiful does that look spices are a brilliant way of helping classic dishes come alive I'll guarantee you'll never ever have had a rice pudding like this before next my tricks of the trays and kitchen tips first how to zest the lemon the important part is not to zest any of the pith watch the following technique and I'll show you how we've got these original graters really important when we use this which is the fine zester not the big rough one not the one for slicing and not the other one for grating this little one here onto a plate because it's always easier to lift off on the plate than it is the board and the most important thing about zesting a lemon is nice long strokes but twisting the lemon round every time we go down we twist same with the orange and same with the lime tap if you go too far let me just show you look we've got that white bitter pith that destroys the wonderful zesty flavor and look that's what we're looking for there this really nice vibrant lemon zest delicious garlic is a key ingredient in so many spicy dishes my tip for finely chopping and mincing is add a pinch of salt for abrasion which helps break the fibers of the garlic down for a much better result for getting the most out of root Ginger simply remove the skin using a teaspoon it's easier than using a knife and you can get around the tricky bits or just keep the skin on and give it a good wash never throw out vanilla pods there's a ton of flavor left in the skin stick inside jars of sugar and leave to infuse great to sprinkle on cakes biscuits or porridge when grinding up spices if you have any left over you can store in an airtight jar for up to two months great for a spicy kick to have at your fingertips foreign My ultimate cookery course crammed with key lessons up tips and 100 recipes to stay your life on and you'll literally

jobs was working in a chip shop I used to put sacks and sacks of potatoes into the rumbler which was then the potato peeler all day long today I'm gonna do something a bit healthier for my oven chips with a Twist simply peel slice and Blanche for three to four minutes drain season uncover well with Paprika spread evenly over an oiled baking tray and place into a preheated oven for 20 minutes simple as that next up easy fish fingers this is Pollock a really nice firm delicious fish cut the fish and finger size battens of fish put them onto your plate and just lightly salt them you can do that literally 20 minutes 30 minutes before you start cooking the fish firms the fish up beautifully and it allows it to become a little more durable especially in the pan now for the coating start by thoroughly coating the fish in seasoned flour and then just roll it to get rid of those little sharp corners because then it stops those Corners almost burning in a pan in to your egg wash and really coat them wonderful and then this is Dill goes brilliantly well with the fish and run the deal through my breadcrumbs that makes it more aromatic lay them onto your breadcrumbs nothing wrong with the chip butty nothing wrong with fish fingers let's give it a lovely modern twist beautiful once the fish fingers are thoroughly coated they're ready to pan fry and they'll need around three minutes on each side I want the fish fingers to be nice and crispy get a really nice color on them first and then we'll flip them over and finish them with butter bring the heat up into the pan a nice little knob of butter that'll work wonders where the breadcrumbs and the deal nice and carefully take them out hey look and smell incredible stay nice and crispy now to assemble my chip buddy starting with button thick crusty bread foreign mop up that amazing flavor on slice in half never slice in an angle my mouth is salivating beautiful on with a ship buddy there's one thing missing and it signifies that I've never forgotten the joy I've come for food but my God that makes me feel like a nine-year-old excuse me for one moment I want to stuff my face [Applause] [Music] homemade fish fingers are my ultimate chip buddy so simple to make but trust me it tastes amazing cooking scrummy sardines topped with a fragrant gremolata dressing but first a deliciously fresh orzo pasta salad this is one of the Hidden Delicacies of Italian pasta also because 90 of the time it's always hidden in a soup or a brothel minestrone and it looks like large grains of rice but once they absorb that water they double in size It's a pasta that needs a lot of help season it nicely pinch of salt and splash of extra virgin olive oil fresh bay leaf into the boiling water and that bay leaf really helps to flavor the pasta give you a little pan turn left and right that stops any pasta sticking to the bottom and the secret behind cooking any pasta is having a nice gentle rolling boil you just have the gas up where the outside of the pan is just rolling and all that also is tumbling over each other gently boiling past the rapidly tends to destroy the outside texture it doesn't take the marinade or the vinaigrette or the sauce for the dressing parmesan Twist of fresh pepper the zest of the lemon I'll squeeze your lemon in there through your fingers to catch all those seeds bring that together with some extra virgin olive oil foreign s taste delicious toasting them just elevates them after eight minutes my orzo is perfectly al dente train it a little bit of cold water through it close the cooking process down let's stop it from going mushy it's the size of pumpkin seeds now a drizzle of olive oil and into the vinaigrette whilst it's still warm just above room temperature because the warmer the pasta the more it absorbs the vinaigrette and now some texture rocket not finely chopped on the fresh basil as well roll them up like a big fat cigar slice in half and then chop the basil crunch just sprinkle the toasty pine nuts it looks like a plate of jewels glistens it's delicious very fragrant also pasta salad now for sardines incredibly healthy an absolutely delicious grilled never ever be intimidated on looking for fresh fish it's about the condition of the fish Bright Eyes fresh gills nice bright red interior and the firmness of the flesh almost you could stand the fish up on his own it needs to be that fresh the best way to get flavor into sardine just to grill it light seasoning olive oil and just roll the seasoning around get your Rosemary peel off a few of the little shards at the end so it's a little bit sharp push the Rosemary in almost like a Threading makes them so much more flavoursome they'll be scared of those fine little bones I remember growing up with sardines tin sardines you didn't tongue your nose up at the bone once The Griddle pan starts to smoke lightly drizzle and then sardines on two and a half for three minutes each side now for the gremlinata a vinaigrette that sits beautifully well on the sardines freshly fastly just run the knife once nothing worse when you over chop parsley and all that delicious flavors left on the board the zest and juice of an orange and the lemon turn them now grandma that's about fragrance natural flavors brilliant for grilled Meats as well a little touch of salt and pepper and then olive oil just to bring it together the garlic I almost want to be like a secret weapon in there raise it bring that together you've got a very fresh clean gremolata almost if we're sat on the Amalfi Coast off then once the sardines are still nice and warm and just thinly coat the gremolata I'd like to pass in the garlic to sit on top and that's citrus from the lemon and the orange to sort of dive underneath see why Italian cuisine rides on the freshest and the simplest execution they allow their ingredients to become the hero not the chef also salad with stunning grilled sardines [Music] wherever you eat this dish it will fill your senses with the sun and the Sea of the Mediterranean delicious [Music] foreign

Pre-order your copy of Ramsay in 10 here - https://linktr.ee/Rams...",2022-12-03 22:16:02.926159, [Music] Welcome to My ultimate cookery course packed with cooking tips information and 100 recipes to take your life on right now it's all about making it easy [Music] making it easy for yourself in the kitchen means using the time you have effectively and the one thing that can really help you do that is your freezer [Music] my recipe for meatballs is so versatile it can be used to make a dozen amazing dishes one of my favorites is meatballs in fragrant coconut broth having a freezer of home-cooked delicious food ready to go can be a real life saver it means you never have to compromise on Flavor these meatballs are delicious but more importantly they freeze so well first off get your pan on and start sweating off the onions and your garlic this recipe involves making the meatballs a classic way but the exciting part is actually cook them in coconut milk and it gives a really nice new dimension to a sort of soft Rich Sumptuous meatball chop the onion nice and finely keeping those slices very close together close to the slices the finer the onions cut it back down at an angle slice down and just chop I want the onions nice and fine because I want some finesse to these meatballs The Secret of a really good meatball is the texture getting that balance right between the minced beef the bread crumbs the milk and the seasoning a couple of cloves of garlic slice of garlic really nice and thinly nice pan nice and hot a tablespoon of olive oil quite generous available onions and garlic in a little touch of salt and pepper with your mince open it up a little bit and sort of cut it out that salt and pepper for me a good meatball is all about the the softness the texture of that Rich beef and the way it sort of melts in your mouth you can color it on the outside but you want it nice and soft and sort of rich in the center mix that in beautifully and then place it back out again I've got some really nice dried chili flakes I'm going to season the onions with the chili flakes chili flakes in cook that out for two minutes I'm gonna add some milk [Music] take your breadcrumbs make a little well three four tablespoons of milk that makes it sort of nice slightly doughy texture but it lightens the texture of the meatball place that in add your onions your garlic and your chili in there as well nice put your hands in there and start mixing them if you've got the right amount of milk and breadcrumbs it doesn't mean binding with an egg don't make them too small the problem with making them too small is the fact that they dry out quickly just size of a golf ball a little bit bigger nice give him a really nice tight squeeze that stops IT from breaking up it always pays to double the recipe and spend a bit more time making extra meatballs so you can freeze a batch ready for another time give the pan a little wipe out don't wash out that pan we've got that flavor from the onions the garlic at the bottom look at that pan nice and hot Taste of olive oil in there place them the top of your pan nice and gently set them in the oil get a palette knife and go underneath them and just sort of tilt the pan and let the pan cook the back of the meatball we're going to add some heat coriander seeds slightly spicy and peppery because they give a really nice flavor to the coconut milk in next some cardamom seeds three or four onto the board knife on in a little touch of turmeric into the center of the pan that's going to give it a really nice spicy flavor a little pinch cinnamon all the time you're doing this those meatballs are just getting tastier and tastier a couple of dried chilies let them Infuse in that oil and then some lemongrass just take the back of your knife and sort of Beat It Down that starts to release all that lovely sort of fragrance like someone's just let off the most amazing fragrant air freshener in for the lemongrass finally some fresh ginger peel it's nice nice and thinly time now turn them over and let the other half for a wonderful flavor to stop in bring the stock up to the boil turn the gas up and then add the coconut milk and I want the coconut milk just sitting underneath the top of a meatball coconut milk in and that sort of gives it that creamy richness but it's not heavy it's a fragrant light richness before we start simmering check the seasoning that nice soft texture of the meatball but that fragrance light richness of the coconut broth it's going to cook those meatballs perfectly bring the broth up to the boil and simmer gently for eight to ten minutes touch them with your finger they should be slightly pliable but slightly springy gas off and finish it off with something light and fresh zest of lime I don't want the zest on top of the meatball sort of cut through that richness and then finally squeeze fresh lime and that just gives it that nice zesty amazing taste stirring the juice [Music] it's got that kick and that vibrant taste now the exciting part when you come to serve it be generous with that coconut broth talk the pan get a good couple of ladles of a broth in meatball [Music] and that is a very delicious way of eating a old-fashioned meatball and bringing it into the 21st century and they're just as good cooked from Frozen as well [Music] the secret to stress-free cooking is making it easy for yourself here are three more recipes all based on my delicious freezer friendly meatballs just defrost them before you get started first up beef meatballs with ariketti kale and pine nuts [Music] the hot oil Brown meanwhile cook origetti pasta then add chopped garlic to the meatballs and shredded kale a delicious green veg packed with vitamins which Cooks in minutes cabbage is a great alternative if you can't get kale put in some of the cooking water from the pasta to steam through when the pasta is cooked al dente drain and add to the meatballs season then finish with sweet buttery pine nuts and grated fresh Parmesan cheese meatballs with other Kitty kale and pine nuts from meatballs to meal in minutes my next easy standby supper is beef meatball sandwich with melting mozzarella and tomato salsa [Music] top a lightly Toasted Roll with pan-fried meatballs then tear up chunks of creamy buffalo mozzarella pile it on and melt it under the grill for the Tangy salsa sliced sweet red onion then add juicy diced tomatoes and roughly chopped fresh coriander Eason and drizzle with olive oil spoon over [Music] perfect in a Flash beef meatball sandwich with melting mozzarella and a tomato salsa a sandwich to die for [Music] my final super easy meatball recipe is fiery meatball soup [Music] foreign chopped onion and finely slice garlic in hot olive oil cumin seeds for warmth and add your meatballs cook on a high heat to get all those aromatic flavors out once the meatballs are browned add hot chili paste for a spicy kick tinned tomatoes dried oregano and a liter of beef stock [Music] then simmer next add sweet corn and chopped courgettes [Music] to finish add hot jalapeno peppers chop fresh coriander and crushed tortilla chips and pop meatball wonder that really packs a punch fiery meatball soup [Music] one versatile meatball recipe four deliciously different dishes food that's certain to make your life in the kitchen easier and stress-free amazing whether you're making great food to freeze or to take straight to the table you need to know how to shop for the best ingredients next up my shopping guide to oils it doesn't matter if you're baking frying or dressing salads using the right oil can dramatically alter The Taste and texture here are the most common oils and what to use them for sunflower oil is a good value all-rounder nice and light for frying bacon in dressings and spicy dishes ground nuts or peanut oil is great for cooking on high heat as it gets really hot without burning sesame oil I flavoursome sweet and nutty oil perfect sprinkled over Asian dishes before serving rapeseed oil is a healthier choice for using in salads I love walnut oil fantastically fragrant it's brilliant for salad dressings and it gives cakes a distinctive flavor oil I use most in my cooking is olive oil [Music] to find some of the best olive oils sold in Britain get to go to one of the most unlikely places an electrical shop in London's East End [Music] turkish-born Mehmet morat has olive oil in his blood my families produce this olive oil for centuries what he doesn't know about it isn't worth knowing the very best extra virgin olive oil is first cold pressed it's actually pressed by Stone and then it's put for a centrifugal spinner which spins out all the bitter Waters and then you've got your pure olive oil cold pressed olive oil and you've got to taste it to believe it pour a little sample slurp it draw it in without don't swallow it warm it in your mouth coat the whole of the inside of your mouth with it and then swallow it will go down like fruit juice and it will leave no grease in a solar oiliness in your mouth whatsoever absolutely Sensational beautiful my favorite use of any olive oils is to pour it into a bowl room temperature rub some wild oregano into it and get some fresh busty bread and just dip it there's food on its own don't need anything else welcome back to my ultimate cookery course next are my guide to making it easy I'll be creating a sweet treat to drool over I want the chocolate my little matchsticks dotted around but first my quick guide to the basic kit you need to get cooking fantastic food you don't need to spend a fortune on masses of kitchen equipment here are three more Kitchen Essentials whisk spoon and spatula these three items are so cheap yet they are so important to Great home cooking a whisk there's so much more control when you've got something whisking in your hand you can gauge it so much better than you can if it's an electric mixer bigger the balloon on your hand whisk the faster it will whip as it draws in more air Wooden Spoons don't scratch pans they should be washed by hand spatulas are indispensable for baking or mixing make sure it's heat resistant so it doesn't melt but more importantly phenomenal for making omelettes great with scrambled eggs and you waste nothing because the spatula almost cleans the bowl instantly with these three you'll be well on your way to cooking like a pro and you'll need all three for my next recipe [Music] my take on classic chocolate brownies is guaranteed to put a smile on anyone's face and not just when they're fresh out of the oven blondies stock up on these delicious blondies they'll keep for up to a week and it's a great way of getting ahead if you're expecting guests around first off melt the butter for the mixture we've had hundreds and hundreds of brownies the sort of white chocolate version I.E blondies are amazing a little bit more subtle keep a little knob of butter for the end just to grease your baking tray turn the gas down gently melt that butter sugar into the bowl [Music] let's give that butter a little whisk it sort of makes the mixture a bit lighter slightly fluffy off with the gas a pinch of salt in the sugar then make a little well in the middle and sort of whisk you can see it's already gone nice and blunt love it give that a really good mix and the secret with the butter be slightly warm sort of it melts the sugar lovely a teaspoon of vanilla extract in next lightning whisk in two whole eggs let's give it a little beat this is such a delicious recipe yeah it's so simple whisking the eggs looking for that nice sort of rich text just smooth paste see why we call these blondies beautiful next teaspoon of baking powder baking powder in half a teaspoon of baking soda aerates the mixture it gives it that little tartness you'll see the sort of Rise instantly in a minute they hit the oven and then your flour whisk with one hand and just slowly add half the flour first get that all mixed up make sure that mixture is really nice and smooth check it occasionally no lumps half a flour in and then the other half and you'll feel it sort of almost go nice and firm and that's why it's so important to add the flowering stages this stops the mixture going lumpy it should be just dropping off the Whisk beautiful change over from a whisk to a spoon next I want some texture some nice sweet chewiness to the blondies dried cranberries they bake beautifully but it gives the Blondie a really nice sort of chewy sweetness in the center next and white chocolate [Music] I'm not going to grate it just chop it up just slice it like little bits of shrapnel I want the chocolate my little matchsticks dotted around now chocolate in lovely fold that in I want a nice even distribution of those wonderful dried cranberries don't over mix it I want to break up that chocolate a nice even mix of cranberries and chocolate see the chocolate there'll be parts of the chocolate in the oven that will actually melt it'll be like little pools of white melted chocolate in the center now baking tray small little knob of butter and the grease baking tray and line it some greaseproof paper and just over extend it shiny side out dull side hits the bottom of the tray in creased proof allows me to maximize on the white chocolate inside the mix my grease with paper the chocolate can melt and almost stick to the tray so the paper is just a really nice insurance policy secondly we want that rise and that sort of crispness now with the mix get your spatula go all the way around I don't see anything left in that bowl position the ball over your tray nice and carefully don't leave that slice in the bowl nobody's licking that one and then just take the back of a spatula go into the corners push and come back into the middle turn the tray around let it work to your advantage try and get it evenly positioned in the tray if it goes in even it Cooks evenly make sure you smooth out the top of the Blondie with the back of the spatula and then into the oven it's going to rise it's nice and crisp on that soft gooiness in the center make your blondies at 180 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes foreign Edge on the outside and that sort of soft gooey Center leave that to cool down and it's going to sort of firm up and wrinkle but it'll stay nice and gooey in the center once it's cooled down take it out and start slicing [Music] after watching blondies a fantastic easy treat to have on hand for yourself or to share [Music] tricks of the trays and kitchen tips to make your life easier make sure you make the most of your freezer my tip for amazing tuna carpaccio is to freeze it first and it will slice beautifully why is this safe leftover wine for cooking my tip is to freeze the remaining wine and freezer bags or ice cube trays it's great in stocks and sauces when you freeze soups or stews in tubs the tip is not to overfill them leave room to expand in the container great tip for a cheap homemade ice cream by a high quality vanilla ice cream and make it your own by mixing in berries chocolate or my favorite rum and boozy raisins [Music] a fantastic tip for leftover lemons and limes is to cut them into wedges freeze and use them like ice cubes they won't water down your drink and they'll also add flavor [Music] Follow My ultimate cookery course crammed with key lessons top tips 100 recipes to stay your life on and you'll literally be cooking yourself into a better chef many of these amazing recipes are on my app please check out the app store for details go on get cooking Welcome to My ultimate cookery course packed with cooking tips information and 100 recipes to stay your life on right now it's all about stress-free cooking big dishes in advance is a brilliant way of taking the stress out of cooking at home and many dishes just get better and better with time first up amazing sticky pork ribs one of the secrets to Great cooking is patience leaving dishes to marinate for one or two days helps to develop the flavor in your food and the end result so much more delicious it's a method I use in the restaurants all the time first off get your roasting tray put the tray on the gas pork ribs 60 meat and 35 40 fat give them a really good season so and pepper nice thing about this cut they stay incredibly moist when they're on the bone and the longer you cook them the more delicious they become just push all that seasoning in to the pork olive oil in make sure that tray is nice and hot and I really want that nice sort of caramelization taking place on the pork that's the nice thing about starting it on top of the stove use your roasting tray get them colored and then in the oven putting the ribs straight in the oven you don't get the color it looks sort of boiled as opposed to a nice caramelized rib Ginger you can't beat fresh ginger with sticky pork ribs place it down nice and firmly and slice the thinner you slice the ginger the more fragrant the ribs garlic and it's really important before you add anything to those ribs make sure we've got the color and the ribs first don't rush it turn them over that's what I want a nice crispy color as they sort of raise in the oven all that color just turns into the most amazing flavor Brazil it's just a chef's term for cooking something slowly in liquid right ginger and garlic in spread it around on all those ribs to sort of roast the ginger and the garlic chili flakes chili flakes in next Szechuan pepper citrusy vibrant peppercorns incredible in next star anise that gives it a really nice sort of aniseedy flavor almost like you're roasting the ribs in fennel then now we've got the heat we've got the spice I want to sweeten things up a little bit some fresh honey glazes to Pork beautifully counteracts against all that Spice in there oh look what's happening color on the ribs is extraordinary it's like a really nice chili sweet caramel now soy sauce brings that little bit of sort of saltiness to it really generous with the soy sauce Japanese vinegar two tablespoons of vinegar in rice wine it gives it that nice sort of tartness to the ribs if you can't find rice wine a dry sherry is a great substitute 300 mil that takes out the heat of that Szechuan pepper those dried chili flakes make sure they're all laid down like a nice tight box of matches bring that up to the boil cooking is all about learning to develop your own likes and dislikes so always keep tasting to make sure you're happy with a combination of flavors slacking a little touch of vinegar on that sharpness now I think what's going on the tartness the heat the caramel the color on the ribs is amazing I want a bit of a sort of oniony flavor I'll put some spring onions in whilst these ribs are in the oven the spring onions will sort of puree they give a sharpness the final taste of that pork in in my spring onions and with my stock 400 mL of stock this is just a simple chicken stock the stock just sits underneath the ribs it absorbs into the rib and the top of the rib glazes underneath the rib and gets crispy and Rich and that's what makes the ribs nice and moist really important into the oven cook at 180 for 30 minutes then turn the ribs over and cook for a further 30 minutes [Music] now wow they smell incredible each side has got that really nice crispy roasted Edge becomes sticky and chewy and sweet sour the fat disappeared and the pork just melts in your mouth I want to take them to the next level gas back on now shake the tray and this is the sort of the way that we finish them in the restaurant but every minute they glaze in that tray they just get to taste better and better now look at them I'm so happy with those ribs done absolutely delicious now but if you want you can put them in the fridge and the flavor will keep developing then just reheat them when you want to serve so piece rib has a nice slice of Ginger on there [Music] wow look at that delicious sticky ribs with an amazing marinade to make my food the tastiest it can be I always start with the best ingredients I can find and the secret to getting the best is simple knowledge is crucial the more you know about where your ingredients come from and how they produce the better so ask lots of questions and learn when it comes to buying pork you can't do any better than ask a butcher and award-winning Master butcher Danny lidgate knows everything about the pig from Trotter to tail his family have been in the meat business for 150 years so this man really is on the money in comparison with other meats Paul from the Trotter down to the cheek we can see here we've got the leg the leg is about this region really lean really good for things like gammons and hams coming down from the leg we've got the loin and that's where the pork chops come from if you take the bones out you can bone and roll it and you end up with a really nice easy to cook cylinder of meat really easy to carve carve like a loaf of breads coming away from the loin we've got the belly and you can see where belly is made up of fatty parts and Meaty Parts don't be scared of the amount of fat that's on it you need that fat to give give the flavors coming through also make sure you can possibly buy it with the skin on the skin will Crispen up nicely give you a good crackling also add flavor into the fat lower down from the bellies we've got the shoulders really the shoulders are a great meet they're slightly fattier than the rest of the animal you can see with this pork shoulder the amount of marble you're getting the mussels the interior marbling make sure you look for the marbling it's essential for the flavor and it's going to make a really good eating experience I think there really is nothing to waste the truss is even a really good flavor because they're gelatinous qualities and the meat can be really really flavoursome also there's Pig's cheeks which obviously require a little bit more cooking because of the use they get but the flavors you're going to get are going to be completely different to any other part of a pig pork is an incredibly versatile mate they say the only part you can't eat is the Oink here's my guide to getting the best out of familiar cuts smoked or unsmoked bacon is not just for breakfast it's brilliant transforming salads gives a real depth of flavor to stews and is delicious in quick and easy pasta dishes [Music] the leg joint best known for ham also makes an inexpensive delicious Sunday roast and is great served with peas pudding and the tenderloin fillet incredibly lean healthy and fast to cook you can stuff it cut it into scallops or strips that are perfect for Asian stir fries [Music] a calm kitchen is an efficient and effective kitchen the less stressed you are the better the food you'll produce so whenever you can get ahead with your cooking here are three of my favorite recipes they've been made beforehand whose flavor improves over time foreign Lamb with sweet potato and raisin [Music] this super simple hassle-free recipe is cooked all in one pot start by Browning chunks of lamb in hot olive oil color and remove then fried onions season add chopped garlic ground ginger and coriander a teaspoon of whole cumin seeds paprika and fennel seeds a cinnamon stick bay leaf and delicate strands of saffron then fry to release all the aromatic flavors next add tomato puree chunks and sweet potato and the juicy Brown lamb for a sweet note add plump raisins then cover with stock and simply leave to simmer for a couple of hours delicious eaten straight away but over time the flavors will develop and improve when you're ready to serve simply finish with fresh parsley minimal preparation and ready when you want it fantastic Moroccan Lamb with sweet potato and raisin my next super simple dish that just gets better and better with time is chili chicken with ginger and coriander [Music] by chopping chicken thighs into pieces now on with the marinade chopped garlic Ginger red chili and lemon juice [Music] in a pan toast coriander and cumin seeds to release their flavors grind and add to the chicken [Music] then pour over plain yogurt add turmeric and seasoning mix and leave to marinade from two hours to overnight next fry chopped onions in olive oil then add chopped garlic and ginger ground coriander garam masala and turmeric tomato puree and butter next add the marinated chicken and all the remaining marinade and cook until tender finally top with coriander marinated for flavor and cooked in 20 minutes chili chicken with ginger and coriander a simple stress-free wander having a delicious sauce on hand to serve with simply cooked fish or meat is a brilliant stress Buster my final recipe is sweet pepper sauce with grilled prawns [Music] for the sauce in hot olive oil fried chopped garlic and diced bread [Music] and put them in a blender [Music] add chopped tomatoes [Music] blister the skin of red peppers under a Hot Grill intensifying the flavor leave to cool then they're easy to peel chop and add Blitz add smoked paprika chili flakes and roughly chopped almonds squeeze of lemon and a dash of Sherry vinegar season Blitz again and add olive oil this sauce keeps really well in the fridge and will intensify in flavor I love it with simple King prawns just add olive oil and Gretel for two minutes on each side [Music] sweet pepper sauce with grilled prawns Simply Delicious [Music] made in advance ready when you want them three stunning simple recipes that take the stress out of the kitchen beautiful this is my ultimate cookery course 100 recipes to stay your life on I'll be showing you an amazing spicy Chutney that's brilliant for transforming the simplest of suppers they don't actually smell much but the flavor they give off is extraordinary but first five more of my 100 tips to make your home cooking easier kicking off with how to skin and debone a fish the hassle-free way interestingly Affiliated side of salmon it's been taken off the bone and now skin off pick up your knife a really nice broad flexible knife a little sharpen lift up the base of the towel and then just Nick a little bit at the end there twist the knife almost as if it's horizontally underneath the salmon cool the skin and you slice the salmon underneath and let the knife do the work now get your skin flip it back over and check you're not leaving too much salmon on top of the skin pull it back and nice and slowly get the skin wrap around your fingers pull the salmon towards you and then just all the way through lay that down one nicely skinned salmon just like a perfect snake skin get your knife and just run the Knife Down and then the pair of tweezers these are fish tweezers but you can use normal tweezers look for the head up and Pull and with the skin being removed from underneath the salmon the pin Bones come out a lot easier and the pinballs only go to just basically halfway along the fillet one nice fillet of salmon beautiful there's still plenty of flavor in the trimmings from Affiliated fish my tip is don't waste those fish bones add to water wine a bay leaf and some chopped veg to make a simple but versatile fish stock at home the perfect base for a delicious fish soup [Music] a great tip for intensely flavored stress-free veg is to steam them in their own juices simply add to a pan with a knob of butter and seasoning then cook on a low heat with a lid on to lock in the moisture [Music] for crispy roast potatoes you can depend on my tip is to parball them leave them to steam dry then sprinkle them with semolina or flour and give them a good roughing up this ensures they go really crispy in the oven a great tip for Browning meat or fish is to drive with kitchen roll before you cook it then you'll get a much better color too much moisture makes the meat steam instead of sear and you'll lose that rich brown crust like the one I got on those sticky pork ribs foreign taking the stress out of cooking is to anticipate the really busy times when you'll need things to hand that are already made my next recipe can be kept on tap in the fridge for weeks on end and is guaranteed to liven up any quick meal spicy chutney with Chutney standing by in the fridge you can always add that special little touch to a simple supper prove that thinking ahead always pays off pan on to start toasting those spices keep the pan nice and low cumin very aromatic very fragrant and it's almost like a light spice next little coriander seeds coriandering now you're going to get a bit of heat in the Chutney mustard seeds well smaller than coriander seeds but so much more powerful mustard seeds in now Curry leaves they don't actually smell much dry but the flavor they give off is extraordinary code is in really important not to burn them otherwise you'll have that bitter taste across the Chutney keep the gas nice and low the secret is sort of toasting them so it releases that oil and intensifies the spice Touch of salt and then a couple of small powerful chilies keep them whole no one's going to eat them but it gives that real nice burst of heat now let them toast gently there we're not going to chop the onion we're going to grate it why because it sort of breaks down to a really nice puree in the Chutney when you grate it hold the root in the palm of your hand and just push nice long straight I want those nice long shards look I've almost got a nice sort of onion puree but it's nice and clear Touch of olive oil spices nicely toasted onions in [Music] three nice cloves of garlic crush them [Music] lay it nice and flat and just slice the garlic nice thin slices garlic in taking your time to get the owners caramelized beautifully will really reap rewards in the long run Tamarind place and sugar in with the sugar first three nice tablespoons of sugar that will give a really nice syrup effect a sort of nice rich syrupy texture to the chutney Tamarind paste you can get Tamarind paste in most delis and the big supermarkets it's really nice thickening agent but it gives that tartness a Chutney and its sort of bridge sugary spicy next in with my coconut add four nice tablespoons that will give a nice body a really nice texture to the Chutney cut that coconut out and now add the carrot grated the carrot just gives the Chutney a really nice sort of punch but also helps to sort of cool down the spice carrots in the water comes out of the carrot flavors the Chutney beautifully but gives that nice sort of vibrant bright color to it as well and grating it almost sort of it Cooks instantly but I want a bit of texture through here turn down the gas and just let that simmer for five minutes because the cars are that moist and juicy then put a couple of tablespoons of water in there to help it along now let's cook that out for five minutes just so those carrots start going nice and soft don't overcook them you want that nice texture in there slightly spicy slightly sweet gas off keep those chilies in there for that it's beautiful nice and gooey delicious and ready to go in his jar because that sits in the fridge just gets better and better and better I love to eat this chutney with cold meats or even cold fish but with ham it's amazing it's a really nice way of livening up the ham just sort of roll it up spoon of chutney I mean it looks fantastic Chutney onto the plate serve and that

quite nostalgic about a bald egg it's something that's never lost it's magic when you slice that top off and dunk that Soldier into the yolk you can't mess with a deliciously runny yolk but this is what I like to dunk in it an anchovy Soldier anchovies interperson water no salt naturally yeah anchovies are very salty so just a touch of pepper rich in Omega-3s the amazing tinned anchovy is a natural flavor enhancer and I use it to Pepper many a Savory dish from roast lamb to the humble toasted Soldier grind them it's a really nice smooth paste the smell of that is almost like being on the seaside now get your soft butter I just put half the butter in first 50 50 is the way 50 anchovy 50 butter that way you've got that real nice salty creaminess mix that up it's absolutely delicious trust me finishing that anchovy butter on a slice of grilled fish I'm in heaven the bread this is a Sourdough delicious very crusty take four nice slices now get that pan nice and hot a couple of tablespoons of that anchovy oil into the pan and then get your bread and lightly fry each side the smell and the anchovy oil is incredible take that out now bring your water up to the boil The Secret of softly boiling an egg is to place them into the water gently on a spoon in and just tilt so they don't hit the bottom nice and Light up to the ball count to five turn the gas down is it four and a half minutes is it five minutes for soft boiled egg I've cooked thousands of them and every time four and a half minutes whilst that's boiling get your bread spread that on there that is incredible chopped parsley brings that kind of freshness goes brilliantly well with the anchovies feel that crunch on inside but I can't resist oh my God right gas off one Beauty in two I feel like a five-year-old again this is that moment when you open the vault and that little magic inside is all yours there's a great Twist on a great classic wow [Music] perfectly soft boiled eggs with dressed up anchovy butter soldiers i've smoked haddock and spinach baked eggs spoke haddock one of my favorite fish delicious highly sustainable it's packed with protein lightly smoked there's not a Dye smoke there's a big difference so you haven't got that bright yellow tinge so much better next baby spinach there's a spinach that's very young full of zinc great flavor a little teaspoon volleyball knob of butter that little touch of oil stops the butter from burning it looks like a lot of spinach I was going to disintegrate almost by two-thirds I'm cooking spinach and butter open up the top of my pepper Mills so the pepper becomes almost like so Cracked Pepper not so fine once your spinach has reduced down by two-thirds add in your cubes of smoked haddock it's got that nice vinegary flavor quite tart pick off the little buds from the stalks keep hold of these and grateful when you're making a target of vinegar red wine vinegar tag and stalks in chop the target into your creme fraiche little season now grain mustard goes brilliantly well with haddock incredible this mustardy Herby creme fresh will work equally well partnered with grilled chicken the haddock's starting to flake because it's smoked lightly cured it Cooks so quickly you creme fresh now it's almost like the beginning of the perfect fish pie but as opposed to putting pastry on top the eggs are going to bake on top so you've got this wonderful egg crust turn the gas off now crack your eggs around the outside just a little twist of pepper get the remainder of your creme fresh and put a little dollop in between that adds richness to the egg whites into the oven at 180. for 10 to 12 minutes [Music] whilst the haddock and eggs baked together I can knock up a simple spring onion garnish in professional kitchen chefs refuse to use the top of the spring onions but I love that nice dark green flavor it says harsh and the white the smell of baked mustard you can't beat [Music] that is beautiful spinach has almost melted in with a had it now just sprinkle your spring onions that gives that really nice sharpness My ultimate hearty breakfast smoked haddock and spinach baked eggs so packed with protein and iron you'll be raring to dive into the day ahead [Music] of eggs benedict with Crispy Parma ham the secret behind a great egg Benedict is in the hollandaise so get your pan on because I'm going to cook a hollandaise over a rolling boil with a glass bowl butter just put it on to melt three egg yolks separated from the white targon vinegar pop that into the eggs if you can't get tarot and vinegar any white wine vinegar will do just as long as you've got that acidity in there give some bite to the hollandaise put your bowl over the Rolling Water and just start whisking if the eggs had Direct contact with the gas pollen days will become scrambled egg once you've got that nice creamy texture a nice thick Sauvignon start adding your butter nice and slowly a couple of tablespoons of butter in and give that a really nice mix if you don't whisk it enough the egg yolks don't take the butter it causes it to split it's more butter using a big balloon whisk like this one makes it easier to incorporate air and helps prevent your mixture from separating all the butter in the best way to keep hollandaise nice and warm is just leave it to sit over that nice warm water bath and it just gives it a really nice room temperature a nice pinch of salt fresh pepper and then face lemon juice that just really makes it vibrant exciting and you want it like a sort of thick custard I just want it to coat the back of the spoon so it's like you're giving the a nice glossy texture to your beautiful poached egg now as the base for the eggs benedict you cannot beat English muffins but the ham I'm Gonna Change I'm going to use the most amazing Parma ham get your pan nice and hot into the pan it's like Posh rashes of bacon beautiful [Music] ham fried nice and crisp like that is incredible beautifully salads fantastic for eggs Benedict [Music] now keep that pan nice and hot I want all that flavor on the Parma ham left in there and rather than toast my muffins I want to put the muffins into the pan I want them sucking up all that wonderful flavor from that crispy Parma ham make sure your muffins are toasted nicely this will prevent them going soggy later look at that nice and crisp that water on to boil for the eggs nicely seasoned really important and then just a little splash of vinegar in the water that helps to set the egg white in a minute you crack it in while the water heats up in the pan there's time to get organized lay a nice slice of ham on the base now water's brought up to the ball turn it down and then spin your water around like a little whirlpool and get a little cup so you just drop the cup in gets caught up in the turbulence of the water the secret is not to boil the water rapidly because the strength of the ball can literally explode your egg as they start to move the way up to the top of the water that's a indication that they're cooked take off any excess little bits of egg white and then out onto a piece of tissue paper that just drains off excess water and it stops your muffin from going really soggy but look they're like little beautiful mozzarella balls give them a little season lift them on to a crispy Parma ham peaceful now get a nice spoon of your Hollandaise glaze over try and do it in one glazing over the whole egg when I tell Jack Holly and Megan I'm Matilda that we're cooking eggs benedict for breakfast they bolt down the stairs and let's be honest who wouldn't run to sit in front of those [Music] a special occasion breakfast that would make anyone feel spoiled eggs benedict with Crispy Parma ham foreign

bread to the table and it was like wow man we've died and gone to heaven start off with a slightly stale bread four five day old loaf left over if it's a fresh bread then it absorbs too much of the egg so therefore it gets soggy you never get it fried and Crisp And if you're not going to use for breadcrumbs eggy bread is a must France they call it pan Perdue the Lost loaf now thank you bread is

pineapple just chew it lightly tossing the caramel get a little knob of butter that makes a nice toffee Apple flavor really simple now you can see what's happening the apples are caramelizing but

red onion and garlic Red Onion because it's sweeter than a white onion slice your onions and your garlic nice and fine traditionally we make it in a pot it's so much better to start it off on top of the stove searing the tomatoes and the garlic but it goes in the oven you actually roast the tomatoes and they don't stew there's a big difference in flavor be quite generous with the olive oil it makes the soup nice and glossy shiny salt pepper and then a little teaspoon of cayenne just gives it that heat but it's not as Fierce as chili take your Tomatoes just slice them in half and then a little touch of sugar that's gonna help intensify the sweetness a little sprinkle of aged off with vinegar gives that nice dark Rich acidity to the soup into the oven 20 25 minutes 180. to make my soup even more irresistible I'm going to make a Punchy sun-dried tomato pesto to drizzle over the top now I'm making this in a pestle and mortar because you feel so much more in control and you're not depending on a blade that's whizzing around a thousand miles an hour next in a dry pan toast off some pine nuts toast them the absolute Max and then in smelling those incredible parmesan slightly grate that this is where it starts to become creamy extra virgin olive oil doesn't need salt because the parmesan is going to season it for you and just take a couple of tablespoons of the oil the sun-dried tomatoes are in really helps to make that stunning pesto I can smell those roasted tomatoes I want them out wow next pour in a little vegetable stock or chicken stock so it sits halfway up the tomatoes put your spoon through those Tomatoes they break up instantly bring that up to the boil let it simmer for three or four minutes I want to make a little bit more creaming out creaming give that a little stir you can keep it rustic and get your Masher in and you've got that nice thick Rich Chunky Tomato Soup or give yourself a stick blender [Music] blitzing it like that you deglaze the bottom of the pan and you get all those amazing flavors from the bottom um that's delicious to make my lunch extra hearty I'm going to knock up a deliciously gutsy version of cheese on toast to go with my tomato soup watch Rabbit an absolute classic I'm gonna make a roux 50 pounds of butter three nice tablespoons of flour and that's all the roux is basically traditionally you would use flour butter and milk but in Welsh rabbit the milk is often cheekily substituted for a stiff slug of stout it gives it that strong gutsy flavor I want it nice and thick make sure those lumps are out a nice teaspoon of Dijon mustard and then season it nice and spicy with Worcestershire sauce gives it that delicious intriguing Flavor now that smells amazing almost brings tears to your eyes beautiful now whilst rabbit wouldn't be a stunning Welsh rabbit without Rich mature cheese so I'm a great Montgomery cheddar goes well with the beer and drop that in really important to put this in by the roux still nice and hot because the cheese melts now for the bread I prefer a good rustic country loaf that will stand up to my hardcore topping I want that nice crisp base to my Welsh rabbit so toast it both sides [Music] spread that beautiful cheesy Berry spicy mixture just great got a blister and bubble and gratinate God a little splash alien Perry and back under the grill for 90 seconds in one delicious creamy roasted tomato soup it's coming back to me all those days I had off school I used to purposely lie about feeling ill just to get a bowl of my mother's tomato soup how bad was that but my God it was worth it oh now my Welsh rabbit look at those babies that just takes cheese on toast to another level wow roasted creamy tomato soup with a sun-dried tomato pesto served with the most amazing delicious Welsh rabbit I feel like bringing in sick [Music] some of the best hearty dinners I can think of are slow cooked recipes made with robust deep flavored ingredients and left to Bubble

muscovado sugar that's a refined brown sugar really rich and somewhat spicy it goes brilliantly inside the muffin and then my crispy granola so now we're gonna put half of this in now and save the other half to sprinkle on top of the muffin give that a really good mix in the center I have some fresh pear top and tail of the pears really important to peel nothing worse when you're trying to enjoy that muffin and you're negotiating with a big sliver skin of pear slice them around the core sides a slice them nice and thinly generally muffins contain around half the fat and sugar of cupcakes once the dry ingredients are mixed together you add in the wet two whole eggs nice milk in followed by gently melted butter give that a good mix [Music] add that to your mixture start folding

cool down and I don't have any problems turning vegetarian once or twice a week when I'm having muffins like that nice smell amazing [Music] a vegetarian breakfast to put hairs on your chest pear and crunchy granola muffins that is a Vegetarian Delight beautiful [Music] coming up I'll be showing you a stunning vegetarian lunch and dinner but first here's a more in-depth look at the key ingredients you'll need for them first for dinner I'm using risotto rice risotto is a flagship classic in Italian cuisine but is widely believed that the Spaniards introduced it to Northern Italy back in the Middle Ages there are three main types Arborio kanaroli and violoni their ability to absorb liquid and flavor whilst releasing lots of starch is what makes risotto uniquely delicious and anxious a tasty creamy and inexpensive way to satisfy lots of tummies without a morsel of meat in sight [Music] the Deep dramatic red color of sweet earthy beetroot makes it difficult to outdo in terms of all-round culinary impact but early forms of this humble room veg were carrot shapes and favored for their medicinal rather than their cooking merits today there is a veritable rainbow of beetroot types to be enjoyed pickled in soups grated into cakes or even simply roasted which is how we're using mine in my amazing vegetarian main course risotto halloumi is a firm springy salty cheese with its roots firmly in Cyprus and Greece the better Lumi is made from sheep's milk rich in vitamins and essential nutrients is thought to promote longevity halloumi keeps for many months if stored unopened in the fridge and its high melting point makes it brilliantly adaptable perfect for grilling barbecue and frying I'll be championing this texture lending Marvel for my yummy vegetarian lunch dish of halloumi courgette and Herb Cakes [Music] as a chef I'm never sniffy about cooking with vegetables because I know that with a bit of care and attention they can be turned into something absolutely stunning for my ultimate vegetarian lunch I've got a couple of fantastic recipes lightly fried my delicious halloumian courgette cakes squeeze every last bit of flavor out of those vegetables but first i'm preparing a simple slow roast tomato and Watercress salad these cherry tomatoes are perfect if you haven't got cherry tomatoes vegetable or even just big normal plum tomatoes lay the tomatoes on the tray and these go into the oven for about 90 minutes if you turn the oven down really low you can leave them in overnight to be honest the longer you leave them the better they taste once you've seasoned them with salt sprinkle over with some sugar on the salt and sugar combined speeds up the drying process because you want that nice chewy texture and then you get these little thyme flowers and just pick off the buds garlic sliced then just spread that on now the tray looks quite full and compact for 90 minutes in the oven you'll see everything shrink down all the Skins blistering and the flavor intensifies so nicely extra virgin olive oil that gives a nice earthy flavor to the tomatoes place your Tomatoes into an oven preheated to 150 degrees C and cook long and slow for an hour and a half now halloumi cakes there's something quite exciting about halloumi cheese it's a very firm cheese and it fries brilliantly [Music] peel the carrots [Music] great not too finely you want that nice texture next courgette the secret is keeping it all grated the same put that into a sieve a sprinkling of salt will draw out liquid from the vegetables then grate the halloumi halloumi cheese doesn't look that tasty but once you've got color on it in the pan it's really really delicious now really important to squeeze out the excess water in the veg and we'll see all that water that needs to come out of there if we didn't do this it'll make your little patties non-friable because the whole thing starts to separate and then mix in with the cheese spring onions chop up the whites and the greens now we're going to season that with some delicious fresh mint and fresh coriander whenever it's vegetarian I like to put a combination of herbs in there tarragon and parsley minted coriander basil and lemongrass all delicious on their own but in tandem their flavors play off each other next two eggs in give that a little mix add the eggs to the mixture and then finally a couple of tablespoons of breadcrumbs the breadcrumbs help dry out any excess moisture mix all the ingredients together before you start shaping these taste the mixture it's really important to identify the seasoning now if you wait until you've cooked them it'll be too late to adjust the seasoning roll them to a large golf ball shape them it's like a little mini burger you can spice these up with some chili in there if you haven't got fresh chili chili flakes and it's something that can be done up a day in advance to get your cakes firm and ready for frying put them into the fridge uncovered for 25 minutes pan on get that nice and hot boss and wait for that I'll get the dressing ready slice of red chili seeds and all on an angle into shards then chop fresh ginger [Music] season with a Sprinkle of sugar and salt add some rice wine vinegar add a couple of tablespoons of olive oil to finish off some chopped coriander [Music] because that's sweet sour spicy flavor with my chili dressing done I can start frying off my halloumi cakes in a hot oiled pan look at that nice crisp Edge you can already start to smell that sauteed halloumi with the courgettes and carrots smells delicious really important for a nice amount of color on them as my cakes Sizzle away I can finish off with my roast tomato salad one of my favorite leaves has to be the Watercress just cut off stalks [Music] slot rings Watercress and shallot go brilliantly well together looks so dainty when you open up these little ringlets [Music] don't forget to turn your cakes now Tomatoes whatever you don't use just jar them and put them in the fridge [Music] just drop those slow cooked warm Tomatoes over the Watercress the sweetness is incredible absolutely delicious a little drizzle of age of ultimate vinegar gives that tartness to the watercress Watercress is naturally peppery so it doesn't need any pepper just a little touch of salt and then a light sprinkling of extra virgin olive oil after five minutes on a medium heat my halloumi cakes are ready so important to have taken out that water [Music] you can see it doesn't disintegrate and then just get your dressing take a spoon of it and then tilt it to the side because I want the garnish I don't want the juice but that does not turn you on to become a vegetarian for the night I honestly don't know what will delicious [Music] my crispy golden halloumi courgette and Herb cakes with a Sumptuous roast tomato and Watercress salad all of the flavor with none of the meat when I was growing up my mum was a very very good cook so we had some great food but it was always meat and two veg and the veg definitely played a bit past but the more attention you pay to cooking vegetables the more you realize they can easily take Center Stage for all the flavor would know In the Flesh here's my ultimate vegetarian dinner first a hearty starter a bruschetta with ricotta and succulent griddle courgettes for my main I'm serving fragrant roasted beetroot and Thyme risotto [Music] but I'll be in trouble with the kids if I don't do it but so I'm enlisting the help of my youngest Tilly to rustle up an indulgent chocolate and lime mousse with crushed raspberries so if you unwrap the chocolate start breaking up in Little Bits we're going to make the most amazing white chocolate mousse our first job is to bring half of our cream up to the boil so what kind of cream is that in there dad that is double cream okay so that's gonna make a really nice rich chocolate mousse what's your favorite sort of chocolate is it white milk dark um I love white and milk what's yours I absolutely love milk chocolate oh my guilty pleasure is it really here we go cream end so that goes in there now you can see what's happening straight away can't you it's melting really quickly melting really quickly so okay oh excuse me at least your Jumper's white so you won't spot it yeah I've got a nice little snap for later in another Bowl add lime zest cold cream and whisk until it forms soft peaks the lime cuts the sort of richness of the cream and that starts to make the chocolate mousse taste a little bit lighter mmm it smells really good the lime gives it a really nice zinginess you're absolutely right next add to the melted chocolate mixture because I'm whisking it's just getting lighter and lighter and lighter have a little taste nice yeah the line gives it a really nice taste Tilly I need the rest for the mousse I need some for my tummy no come on chocolate mousse into the fridge our next job is to separate out three egg whites this is where I need you at your absolute best okay because to whip those whites it's going to be really tough so we'll take it in turns 30 seconds each okay you go first 10 seconds gone come on silly in seconds gone 20 seconds gone come on you can do it 10 seconds to go five four three two one and change excellent hold the ball right no no way [Music] you can't do that to me 30 seconds that's the best way of whipping up egg whites you start tipping that sugar in slowly should go feeling all very happy in there so a contentious whipped egg whites will make our mousse light and Airy and when they've reached soft peaks we can gently mix in our cooled white chocolate and cream mixture once the egg whites hit the cream yep the chocolate sets the egg whites keep the cream nice and fluffy and you get this nice light mousse in the bowl now I need you to crush some raspberries please with some fresh mint you can see all the juice coming out now take your mousse wow that looks really cool now look at that down the bottom it's a crushed raspberry delicious now I'm going to set that in the fridge if you use the can I open the door please our yummy white chocolate mousse will take at least two hours to set so we can crack on with our Mediterranean inspired vegetarian starter griddle courgette Ricotta and mint bruschetta for this recipe you'll need a griddle pan an essential piece of kit for that char grill look cut thick slices of chapata bread drizzle both sides with olive oil [Music] season with a little salt and pepper and griddle each side until toasted then slice a couple of courgettes diagonally into half a centimeter thick pieces drizzle and coat in olive oil and season with salt and pepper sear on a smoking hot griddle pan in batches until all the courgettes are bar marked on both sides next roughly chop mint leaves and combine with creamy ricotta cheese spread your toasty to your pattern with dollops of minty Ricotta and top with your seared courgette super simple and super tasty now we're going to make a delicious beetroot risotto we need to get the shallots just slice them in half and then just chop them like that okay okay now have you ever made a risotto shallots please into the pan for Daddy add a Sprinkle of salt and pepper along with a couple of crushed cloves of garlic once you start cooking the risotto it's really important to have your stock gently boiling away if we're adding cold stock on top of the rice all the time it just slows down the process generally you cook a nice wide flat pan if you're cooking a deep pan all the rice sort of Cooks at different temperatures what stock is that in there dad because that's a vegetable stock yeah because you can't have different stocks if it's for a vegetarian can you no I made that mistake once putting beef stock in the vegetarian soup no I did and Matilda sure I'm positive I'm joking fly off the time how nice is that smell s rice in this is Arborio rice it's a perfect rice for risotto now it's really important to sear the rice if we were just to put the stock in without sweating off the rice it goes all starchy so keep on stirring for Daddy no flambe on the risotto to go with our deep red beetroot theme I'm adding red wine followed by the first Ladle of stock to get things started now we're off wow it's giving it a cloudy sort of look [Music] what's happening to the stock sock is reducing down and the rice is sucking it in that's right so the rice is actually getting nice and plump while the risotto is live when it's like this now we can't stop cooking it we have to cook it all the way okay ready for the next ladle good girl here we go Ladle in so we have to make this for literally 20 25 minutes and we're nursing it all the way eight words killed him brought them a little bit of salt and sugar yeah and a little bit of aged bathroom vinegar in there roasted them I'm a great my parmesan how's that Rice doing rice is doing good no no where you want to be now look at that nice glossy textured rice so beetroot I want you to put two thirds of the beetroot in there for me saving one third for the top good sprinkle the parmesan in there for me please all over again and then we're just going to get some nice butter in there the butter gives the risotto a really nice gloss look at that beautiful come down let it come down first and then after Daddy beautifully there you go good wonderful shaking risotto should be like lava just flows out and then the rest of the beavery on top [Music] and some extra virgin olive oil that I'll pick up the bruschetta you take that to the table okay let's go die this is my ultimate vegetarian dinner delicious courgette Ricotta and mint top bruschetta an anxious roasted beetroot and Thyme risotto and put

Pre-order your copy of Ramsay in 10 here - https://lin...",2022-12-03 22:16:02.926159, my next recipe is a proper British classic that's super simple to cook and costs next to nothing a delicious apple crumble crumbles are the perfect way to use fruit when it's in season there's lots of it about it's nice and cheap but most importantly the fruits at its absolute best [Music] first off I'm going to make a really nice light caramel pan on nice and low great two apples [Music] this helps to almost sort of pure the Apple so much quicker there's a lot of flavor in the skin so don't worry about peeling the fruit whether it's pears plums peaches flavors in the skin [Music] start the camera a couple of tablespoons of sugar the sugar helps to get rid of the tartness in the Apple a touch cinnamon that starts to make it a little spicy open up your vanilla and just scrape out all those seeds now this just makes it light and fragrant all those seeds in to the Sugar We're making caramel be patient and always swirl the dish instead of stirring it when the sugar goes Brown add the Apple starts to sort of cool down the caramel but it gives it a really nice sort of caramelized puree apples almost disintegrating smells incredible and the gas down slice up two apples it's a crumble That's Got No Frills straightforward they're faffing around no peeling on the skin I want them to sort of stand out from the camera apples in now there's nice thick chunks of Apple sort of almost bedding itself into the puree dried cranberries gives it that nice sort of shock in the texture sweet chewy I want it to sort of taste zesty spicy so sit the lemon zest on top of your apples and cranberry fresh lemon juice over and that just gives that extra acidic kick takes the Cranberries the apples the caramel and the cinnamon to another level turn the gas off that says let's concentrate on the crumble flowering a couple of tablespoons of Demerol sugar sugar helps to get the topping nice and crispy batter in give that a nice little rub what we're looking for is like a breadcrumb mixture lightly season it with a touch of cinnamon and the dimmer our sugar sort of helps to get a nice fine crumble mix and it stops the butter from sort of melting in that flour so that's the basic crumble mix but I'm not finished yet muesli two-thirds crumble one third muesli mix that in if you haven't got muesli then crunchy granola works brilliantly too lovely now start off in the center and work your way around I want the crispiness on the top the puree on the bottom of the caramel and then the texture in the center a good tip turn the gas back on I want it bubbling before it goes in the oven because then you just got to cook the top so as soon as you see that caramel starting to Bubble down the side in she goes let's go all right bake it 200 degrees Celsius for 12 to 14 minutes until golden brown smells amazing [Music] still bubbling and look at it a delicious but very simple crumble with apples at their absolute best beautiful and on for the stuffing it's a saddle of lamb basically a sort of Rolls-Royce cut perfectly shaped and it suits stuffing to an absolute tea but the stuffing finely chop an onion garlic nice thin slices oil in onions and garlic in [Music] salt and pepper make sure the stuffing is beautifully seasoned so it helps to season the inside of the lamb now we've got the color on those onions I'm going to throw in some pine nuts that helps to give a bit of a texture here's where it starts getting really exciting spinach in and just lay the spinach over the pine nuts it looks like a lot of spinach that's going to condense and disappear almost instantly it's more flavors finish when you saute it as opposed to steaming it or boiling it gas off look at that now to bring that together no eggs no bread crumbs crumpled feta over the spinach feta cheese adds a beautifully salty sharp and creamy flavor what this does it brings that stuffing together now open up the lamb keep those little fillets to the side that's the channel that we want to stuff so I want to just open that up a little bit there salt and pepper lightly if you forward stuffing in we're going to season it with Sumo sumac is a wonderful lemony spice that goes brilliantly with lamb and you can get it in most big supermarkets and I sort of cuts through that thick Rich sweetness of the Lamb open up that lamb there take a spoon if you're preparing this for the day ahead then let the stuffing cool down it's inevitable when you start rolling it and tying it someone's going to squeeze out so load up the ends take these Beauties these little fillets and just support that stuffing and sort of increase that beautiful tunnel and then from there over there and bring that towards you and then roll like I said some of the stuff is going to come out now just tie it first off around the side and don't worry about some flash which is not just tie it one in the middle you can get butcher string from your local butcher or at cookware shops I got two ties go too tight it just forces all that stuffing out of the Lamb when it's in the oven nice now I want to season the top of it roll the joint to make sure all the skin gets seasoned now you think normally that just goes in the oven like that that's how my mum would do it but get your tray onto the gas oil in get it really nicely colored none of your stuffing's coming out of the sides really important look at that color beautiful does kick start the roasting process gas off into the oven cook for 45 to 55 minutes depending on how pink you want your lamb [Music] the lamb out of the fat to rest resting it raised up in the tin will stop it cooking but not cool it down too quickly and means you won't lose any of those lovely juices next I'm making a simple but sophisticated accompaniment for the lamb top and tell the Cucumber peel it cut the Cucumber into three and just core take out all that it's just sort of watery seedium it spoils the flavor sliced cucumber cucumber in really nice way of making a cheap and cheerful cucumber look glamorous we're going to dress that cucumber with a nice fresh yogurt a couple of tablespoons next some fresh mint dressing Touch of salt Touch of pepper and then pomegranate molasses that just swings it up finish that with lemon mix that up it's rested carefully take off the string and then just gently pull them back the straight edge knife is going to cut through that crispy fat on the outside instantly I tied it purposely so I can guess my portion control from the lines hold it nice and firmly look at your line where the string was and look and this one is going to be amazing lay and down just in those two slices there it proves that stuffing Meats is for

impressive taste amazing but more importantly they are so simple to do pan on for the stuffing it's a saddle of lamb basically a sort of Rolls-Royce cut perfectly shaped and it suits stuffing to an absolute tea but the stuffing finely chop an onion garlic nice thin slices oil in onions and garlic in [Music] salt and pepper make sure the stuffing is beautifully seasoned so it helps to season the inside of the lamb now we've got the color on those onions I'm going to throw in some pine nuts and that helps to give a bit of a texture here's where it starts getting really exciting spinach in and just lay the spinach over the pine nuts it looks like a lot of spinach that's going to condense and disappear almost instantly just more flavor it spinach when you saute it as opposed to steaming it or boiling it gas off and look at that now to bring that together no eggs no bread crumbs crumbled feta over the spinach feta cheese adds a beautifully salty sharp and creamy flavor what this does it brings our stuffing together now open up the lamb keep those little fillets to the side that's the channel that we want to stuff so I want to just open that up a little bit there salt and pepper lightly and before we put our stuffing in we're going to season it with Sumo sumac is a wonderful lemony spice that goes brilliantly with lamb and you can get it in most big supermarkets and it sort of cuts through that thick Rich sweetness of the Lamb open up that lamb there take a spoon if you're preparing this for the day ahead then let the stuffing cool down it's inevitable when you start rolling it and tying it something's going to squeeze out so load up the ends take these Beauties these little fillets and just support that stuffing and sort of increase that beautiful tunnel and then from there over there and bring that towards you and then roll like I said some of the stuff is going to come out now let's tie it first off around the side and don't worry about some flash which is not just tie it one in the middle you can get butcher string from your local butcher or at cookware shops I got two ties go too tight it just forces all that stuffing out of the Lamb when it's in the oven nice now I want to season the top of it roll the joint to make sure all the skin gets seasoned now you think normally that just goes in the oven like that that's how my mum would do it but get your tray onto the gas oil in get it really nicely colored none of your stuffing's coming out of the sides really important look at that color beautiful it does kick start the roasting process gas off into the oven cook for 45 to 55 minutes depending on how pink you want your lamb lift the lamb out of the fat to rest resting it raised up in the tin will stop it cooking but not cool it down too quickly and means you won't lose any of those lovely juices next I'm making a simple but sophisticated accompaniment for the lamb top and tell the Cucumber peel it cut the Cucumber into three and just core take out all that it's just sort of watery seedium it's spoils the flavor slice the Cucumber cucumber in really nice way of making a cheap and cheerful cucumber look glamorous we're going to dress that cucumber with a nice fresh yogurt a couple of tablespoons next some fresh mint dressing Touch of salt Touch of pepper and then pomegranate molasses that just swings it up finish that with lemon mix that up lamb is rested carefully take off the string and then just gently pull them back straight edge knife that's going to cut through that crispy fat on the outside instantly I tied it purposely so I can get my portion control from the lines hold it nice and firmly look at your line where the string was and look this one is going to be amazing lay and down just in those two slices there it proves that stuffing Meats it's for special occasions because that is a saddle of lamb at its absolute best stuffing meats and fish not only makes them look fantastic it also gives them an extra added flavor Dimension too once you've mastered the technique you'll be able to turn out dishes that will guarantee you'll have an unforgettable Feast oh fresh prawn rolls one of the keys to cooking for crowds is creating the atmosphere and that buzz getting your guests to sort of almost get involved and dip in and dip out this is an exciting fragrant wrap that is so easy to do first off soak the noodles these are thin glass noodles basically bring the kettle up to the boil and just pour just let them steep there for a couple of minutes the noodles are for my prawn rolls as they soak I'm gonna make a spicy dipping sauce to go with them start off with sugar we're trying to create that sweet sour salty but a really nice sort of heated sauce as well rice wine vinegar that will dissolve the sugar fish sauce now that's going to give it its saltiness next the chili I want the seeds left in because I want some power chili in a little bit of garlic don't need to chop it too finely just slice it take a spring onion just top and tell them slice is bringing in nice and thinly so it's sort of almost permeates that dipping sauce I grew up with a love of spring rolls but on the back of my visit to Vietnam it sort of transform my respect for a spring roll give that a little mix a little bit of coriander and fresh mint roll them up chop herbs in there's no olive oil in there there's no cream there's no butter it's just a really nice light dipping sauce and wow all those senses going on now I'm gonna make the filling for the wraps a really nice fresh noodle salad rinse the noodles in cold water then chop them into bite-sized lengths prawns peeled and cooked slice them up the prawns give a really nice sweetness next the vegetables I want crunch freshness texture baby gem lettuce and just shred that lettuce next spring onion the good news about these wraps is that you can make them up in advance sit them in the fridge and then take them out literally seconds before you guess arrive kill the cat so you've got a really nice fresh crunchy carrot now fresh mint fresh basil and fresh coriander together it sounds a little bit bizarre but it tastes amazing don't hold back with the herbs they'll really help make the filling vibrant fresh and aromatic finally touch a lime squeeze that fresh lime juice over there a couple of tablespoons of your dipping sauce don't put too much in there it just makes all the filling too wet just give that a really good mix that's a very quick simple salad to eat now but let's get it into a wrap now take your rice paper wrap literally 30 seconds in warm water you can get rice paper wraps from your local Asian supermarket or buy them online gently lift it out of the water there beautiful lay it carefully onto your board [Music] place the mixture the bottom don't overfill it could be a nightmare to roll them over first nice and tightly halfway then tuck in the ends make sure nothing's coming out the sides useful they're so light fragrant incredibly simple to do and there you go a very delicious fragrant Asian wrap certainly different to the Chinese spring rolls I grew up with

your scissors trim the edge almost we've got a bit of a sort of sharp point bring your three figs together and just thread the top of each fig nice and gently rosemary works wonderfully with sweet

caramel four or five tablespoons of sugar now flatten that out and get it nice and even when the sugar is even caramel cooks evenly it's changing now you can see it melting from the outside in the one thing you don't do is shake the pan rapidly and see it almost like sort of a lake defrosting and it's hitting to the center bubbling still not dark enough yet it's getting there turn the gas down and stay in control let the sugar melt until it turns a dark amber color the secret behind any good caramel is just stopping it from overcooking lovely take that off the gas knob of butter in there just gently whisk in the butter is cooling the caramel down you'll see it changing color to like a cafe lay next add a log of the balsamic vinegar nice beautiful got that nice dark richness of the caramel a little touch of water in there that way the caramel doesn't go too thick now put the caramel back on the heat take your figs and sort of place them in gently lovely and then just add all that lovely little marinade mmm don't waste that it's amazing stuff there no icing sugar and balsamic vinegar there's something so tasty baste those figs because the skin gets nice and crispy on the outside and

figs i'm gonna finish that now with some zest and then some little nibbed almonds and the rich creamy jam texture of the fig with the ricotta brilliant that is an amazing way of slow roasting fruit

nice scraping of orange zest orange liqueur don't whisk that in fold it in and that stops the cream from separating lovely now take that out of the bowl and put it into a piping bag unwrap over your

Pre-order...",2022-12-03 22:16:02.926159, first off get that pan really nice and hot these are sirloin steaks sear it in the pan with all that fat on i'll add flavor salt and pepper couple tablespoons of olive oil in pan nice and hot hold up the steak and lay it in always lay away through the panna a little shake and it stops the steak from sticking we're looking for color and if it sticks it's gonna burn while the steaks are cooking i can get on with my super quick marinade now two tablespoons of meat soup paste that's a fermented soybean that gives a really nice sort of rich sweetness tablespoon of sugar a couple of tablespoons rice wine that gives it a really nice vinegary kick a couple tablespoons of olive oil salt and pepper i'm looking for a nice sort of thick rich marinade marinade done it's time to turn the steaks sort the pan and to give the steaks a little base all we're doing every time is just adding more more flavor take your tongs and sort of lift the steak on its back and really melt all that fat down off of the gas take them out just take your knife see all that fat there just slice that off i don't want any of that now in to the marinade [Music] useful tacos are one of mexico's most popular street foods they've been made from beef pork chicken or fish and are loaded up with amazing sauces and spices now i want something sort of pickly cabbage these are um chinese cabbages slice it in half and look at it really crisp and really tasty we're going to slice that into quarters and then just shred it and take your time you think of cabbage here and you think of sort of braised overcooked cabbage nothing worse but attacker you want freshness a little season of chili flakes they sort of discreetly give it a little bit of heat a little touch of rice wine vinegar if you haven't got that fresh lemon juice a small drop of toasted sesame seed oil give that a really good mix now i need something to sort of bring it together we take some wasabi paste very hot very spicy a sort of thumbnail size i'm gonna mix that with a couple of tablespoons of mayonnaise and give that a really good mix these are basic corn tortilla the trick is to sort of color them and then shape them actually place it on the gas ring use some tongs so it's not to burn yourself you can also toast your tacos in a frying pan from there i'm just gonna place it on the rolling pin literally 30 seconds as it cools down the great thing about serving tacos is people can fill them themselves just the way they want them cabbage just squeeze out wet marinade a nice rustic little mountain mayonnaise on wait you see how soft and delicious and almost sort of melting in the mouth texture we've got on this amazing sirloin it's got that really nice sear around the outside it's just nice and pink in the middle start off with my crispy shell back of the spoon with the wasabi mayonnaise inside taco and just sprinkle that delicious pickled cabbage and then just start lining my taco three or four slices touch more on my spicy layer and that is how i'd make the perfect taco [Music] this is like a triple omelette but a lot more ingredients than a normal mesh we'll start off with some lovely smoked bacon slice the bacon bacon in those salts little touch of pepper start off on a high heat get that bacon really nice and crispy otherwise you just boil the bacon and it's got that soft unpleasant texture in the frittata turn down the gas and now start adding your veg roughly chop a red pepper and add it to the pan the peppers and the bacon take the longest so they've always got to go in first now soaking them off the peppers have been cooked now from that sort of rendered fat from the bacon and then the spring onions just bunch them up slice them i want them on an angle so they come like little green diamonds spring onions in now for the eggs cracking the eggs for that size pan seven or eight eggs i want to fill it right to the very top and more importantly when i turn this out i want it like a gato nice and thick so slice through and see all those wonderful verge [Music] i'm gonna season the eggs with some parmesan cheese be quite generous because it adds a really nice saltiness [Music] fresh ground pepper and then whisk whisk up those eggs nicely [Music] then add peas to the pan and to give the dish a wonderful aromatic freshness some fragrant chopped basil i want to chop that sort of roughly because i want to see those flecks of green going in i want it looking charming and how many times have you seen a dull omelet frittatas in my mind really helped encapsulate the magic of having savory eggs cooked beautifully but with texture now just before we add the eggs i've got this beautiful little goat's cheese and it's strong and powerful so i want to slice it into little chunks and then just have it dotted around i want to discover these little pockets of creamy goat's cheese now slowly add the eggs [Music] fill that right up and get your spoon now just let all that egg go down to the bottom bring it back up to the boil and sort of clean around the sides and then some of this delicious salty creamy goat's cheese over the top now i want it melting like a perfect slice of cheese on toast nice now from there turn the grill on for four to five minutes [Music] now just looking at that delicious take a little paring knife and just make sure it's released on the sides just take your panel tap that will hopefully release the frittata from the bottom of the pan now abort over the panel turn that gently and just shake say a little prayer and lift off back beautiful now from there on there it's there look now slice through you can see how soft and creamy that is in the center and that goat's cheese is just melting almost like a little sauce inside it's so exciting but more importantly so easy to do it's got texture it's got creaminess and that for me will beat any omelette for brunch serve with a stack of hot butter toast and a steaming pot of coffee this easy frittata turned the humble egg into the perfect dish for kicking off the weekend [Music] pan on get that nice and hot you think of the sort of density of a pork chop how it needs a little bit of help sweet sound peppers go brilliantly well first slice the peppers that's the flat side of the pepper so stand it up trying to slice a pepper on the side is a nightmare there's the center start off it's almost like sort of peeling an orange go all the way around and down and look that's what you want now place the pepper down three finger rule one finger in front two behind pinky holding it down thumb holding it nice and flat the flatter the vegetables the more confident you are when you slice so don't worry about the speed just let the knife do the work and take your time speed comes the most important thing is to get your technique right red onion now sweet sour peppers olive oil in i'm going to saute them which is just the chef's turn for shallow frying on a high heat for maximum taste some salt and pepper add a tablespoon of sugar sugar helps to break down the peppers quicker but caramelize the onions frying them in a frying pan perfect it's one of the sort of basic essential tools of any kitchen because it's so multi-purpose great for sauteing tossing great for cooking fish on meat push away and pull back push away and pull back that hissing is something you need to hear constantly because the minute that's gone your peppers and your onions start to boil and you really want them to soak in you now start to see it glistening in the way that it's starting to caramelize sugar's working beautifully that's ready for the red wine vinegar in smells incredible it helps to stain the peppers as well look at the glaze now you can see the sugar it's worked as magic turn down the gas and add a couple of tablespoons of fresh extra virgin olive oil let them stew for two to three minutes now i want to make the peppers nice and light and sort of sweet aromatic just roll the basil almost like a big cigar slice basil in and then literally cook it out for 30 seconds i want them off beautiful okay pan back on now for the pork chops i want to make sure they don't curl up in the pan they start curling up in the pan they're going to cook unevenly a few simple cuts through the rind means the chop stays flat and cooks evenly point the knife down flip through this seasoned beautifully nice large shards of pepper punch that through lightly guaranteed that seasoning is gonna stay there hot pan touch garlic and touch of thyme the garlic take a couple of cloves don't peel it don't chop it just knife on crush it olive oil in just starting to smoke top of the chop in and lay away from me nice keep that heat in the pan put the garlic in there early a nice fragrant bunch of thyme see how the pork is staying nice and flat turn that over look at that beautiful i want a little bit of thyme underneath there start squeezing that garlic out i want the flavor coming out butter in thin slices of butter tilt the pan and baste so i'm sort of speeding up the cooking process at the same time i'm keeping the pork chop really nice and moist and now look at the color that butter it's almost like sort of a nut brown check the color on the other side useful when they're that thick three and a half to four minutes each side 30 seconds from now they're going to be medium so i'm going to take them out and let them rest the secret to perfectly moist pork chops is letting them rest almost as long as they're cooked in the pan [Music] a nice spoon of these peppers the basil smells incredible keep that garlic on there be generous with that vinaigrette from the peppers because it really is incredible do two things simple like that pork and peppers and your confidence is gonna shoot through the roof a stunning pork chop with sweet and sour peppers

the most amazing anchovy dip with vegetables and bread first cut slices of baguette and bake in the oven at 180 degrees c for six minutes or until crisp meanwhile roughly chop garlic and shallots and add to a food processor along with a tin of good quality anchovies sprinkle in some pitted black olives flat leaf parsley and drizzle in the reserved anchovy oil and a little olive oil blitz to a paste and add pepper then decant into a jar ready to transport serve with a handful of fresh baby carrots peppery radishes and your crisp baguette toast anchovy dip a portable and deliciously palatable alfresco treat [Music] now a spicy chilli yogurt dressing with a prawn salad first things first i'd like you to make the dressing fish sauce doesn't really smell like fishes so one and a half tablespoons of fish sauce two chilli i like this especially if you have it on the side of the pork little teaspoon of sugar oh that's it good in so four tablespoons of yogurt three four some zest in there why are you making it in a jam jar not a bowl well this is for a little picnic and it's a great way of transporting we squeeze the lime in there and then we put the lid on shake it and then i want you to shut it on tight [Music] come on it's a bit like a tummy see that sounds like my tummy only sometimes only sometimes thank you for that hi nick is you and the first time you have it's like a little thingy it's fresh salty citrusy but delicious now cucumber and the salad i want to get rid of all the seeds so if you just nice and gently peel the cucumber why do you feel it can you not eat the skin on it you can eat the skin but i want this salad to taste light and fresh you can use a knife for this too though can't you you can peel with a knife but the speed peeler takes off the slices nice and thinly so much quicker so much quicker that's why it's called a speed peeler looks better now looks a bit naked it does look a bit naked doesn't it now you get your spoon and see what happens a teaspoon just takes out all those seeds so whilst it sits in the dish it doesn't make the salad go all soft because that cucumber is nice and crunchy [Music] that's really good there you go so see where your knuckles are there that's what's always going to protect if you put that little finger out this little piggy boom comes off what did i tell you about daddy's knuckle that's the first place you cut off all the time there you go the next addition to our prawn salad is firm juicy baby gem lettuce look at the lettuce in half what about the butt the butts [Music] i'm keeping the butts on for now so when i slice it it stays together okay and then a little bit there we don't use okay when you prepare lettuce for a picnic you never slice it too thinly okay otherwise it will it's good prawns are ready [Music] your tummy sauce is ready your dressing is ready take the lid off and the trick is you dress the bottom of your dish because i'm going to put the prawns on here to protect the lettuce get your cucumber i put my cucumber on and then finally that is okay now the salad's not gonna go soft why is that because it's not that it's not straight onto the dressing that's right what happens is we wrap this now and then we get to our picnic drizzle the sauce on top we mix it up we've got the dressing on the bottom and the dressing on top of the dressing on top that's right a little bit of tim film do you know the cling film check i don't know the clint field trick yet no thing fell over the top of the toilet what you don't understand it when you're my age oh you've been my age then well okay salad in the fridge with the dressing ready to go for a picnic is my ultimate picnic dinner feast prawn and cucumber salad with a spicy yogurt dressing anchovy dip with crudites

one of my golden rules for producing fantastic food is learning to cook with confidence this recipe is so straightforward but tastes absolutely amazing pan on get that nice and hot you think of the sort of density of a pork chop how it needs a little bit of help sweet sound peppers go brilliantly well first slice the peppers that's the flat side of the pepper so stand it up trying to slice a

one finger in front two behind pinky holding it down thumb holding it nice and flat the flatter the vegetables the more confident you are when you slice so don't worry about the speed just let the knife do the work and take your time speed comes the most important thing is to get your technique right red onion now sweet sour peppers olive oil in i'm going to saute them which is just the chef's turn for shallow frying on a high heat for maximum taste some salt and pepper add a tablespoon of sugar sugar helps to break down the peppers quicker but caramelize the onions frying them in a frying pan perfect it's one of the sort of basic essential tools of any kitchen because it's so multi-purpose great for sauteing tossing great for cooking fish on meat push away and pull back push away and pull back that hissing is something you need to hear constantly because the minute that's gone your peppers and your onions start to boil and you really want them to soak in you now start to see it's glistening in a way that it's starting to caramelize sugar's working beautifully that's ready pour the red wine vinegar in smells incredible it helps to stain the peppers as well look at the glaze now

and light and sort of sweet aromatic just roll the basil almost like a big cigar slice basil in and then literally cook it out for 30 seconds i want them off beautiful okay pan back on now for the pork chops i want to make sure they don't curl up in the pan they start curling up in the pan they're going to cook unevenly a few simple cuts through the rind means the chop stays flat and cooks evenly point the knife down flip through it's seasoned them beautifully nice large shards of pepper punch that through lightly guaranteed that seasoning is going to stay there hot pan touch garlic and touch of thyme the garlic take a couple of cloves don't peel it don't chop it just knife on crush it olive oil in just starting to smoke top of the chop in and lay away from me nice keep that heat in the pan put the garlic in there early a nice fragrant bunch of thyme see how the pork is staying nice and flat turn that over i want a little bit of thyme underneath there start squeezing that garlic out i want the flavor coming out butter in thin slices of butter tilt the pan and baste so i'm sort of speeding up the cooking process at the same time i'm keeping the pork chop really nice and moist and now look at the color that butter it's almost like sort of a nut brown check the color on the other side useful when they're that thick three and a half to four minutes each side 30 seconds from now they're gonna be medium so i'm gonna take them out and let them rest the secret to perfectly moist pork chops is letting them rest almost as long as they're cooked in the pan [Music] a nice spoon

peppers and your confidence is gonna shoot through the roof a stunning pork chop with sweet and sour peppers the frying pan is so simple but incredibly useful with this one pan you can make a million different dishes the more you cook with your frying pan the more your confidence will grow here are three of my favorite easy pan-fried dishes first up pan fried scallops with crunchy apple salad

wonderfully rich and glossy add butter and simmer for 10 minutes [Music] plate up and spoon over the sauce cooked in under 20 minutes chicken and chicory in masala sauce [Music] my final dish cooked in the versatile frying pan is sea bream with tomato and herb salsa [Music] fry fillets of sea bream skin side down in hot olive oil if they buckle up press gently down for perfect even cooking then

tomato and herb salsa ready in under 15 minutes one pan three simple impressive and absolutely delicious dishes beautiful coming up on my ultimate cookery course along with a hundred recipes to stake your life on i'm gonna give you a hundred quick cooking tips to make your life in the kitchen easier first up how to keep your knife sharp it's far harder working in the kitchen with a blunt knife than it is with a sharp knife the secret behind keeping a sharp knife sharpen it before and every time you use it first grip the steel feel really comfortable about holding the still imagine you're holding a tennis racquet or you're playing squash you've got to be really comfortable with it now 45 degrees confident grip confident grip with a knife this is the butt of the steel really important to keep your fingers behind there you never grip a steel with your fingers over that because the knife comes back in you've just lost a finger always grip behind nice long strokes so we get the whole of the blade over steel stroke and we start from the bottom to the top so there across there across slow strokes over the top of the steel and then come back underneath then back underneath it is so dangerous working in the kitchen with a blunt knife you can cause so much damage working with a sharp knife is ten times quicker more efficient now that's ready to start chopping to stop your chopping board rocking or slipping a great tip is to simply wet a kitchen cloth kitchen paper or tea towel and place it underneath [Music] now you can chop with confidence [Music] my next top tip is get the most out of your humble veg peeler it's brilliant for slicing ultra thin ribbons of veg perfect for asian dishes great for making long delicate parmesan shavings to top soups and salads it also makes wonderful chocolate curls your pepper mill is more versatile than you might think tighten the top screw to get finely ground pepper ideal for soups and sauces [Music] for general seasoning you want it medium ground so set the screw in the middle and loosen it right off for coarse pepper perfect for steaks and fish peeling garlic for one clove simply bash it with the back of a knife and the skin comes off easily for a whole head crush separate into a bowl cover and shake hard for about 10 seconds then simply pick out the peeled cloves [Music] this is my ultimate cookery course 100 recipes to stake your life on i'll be showing you a roast chicken recipe to die for hold the drum and slice straight through but first like any good chef i'm always looking to get great ingredients at the right price my shopping mantra is simple first rely on your senses make sure whatever you're buying it looks smells and really feels good and if you get the chance taste it before you buy it second is to recognize that knowledge is crucial the more you know about where your ingredients come from and how they produce the better so ask lots of questions and learn you're never too old to learn from experts and when it comes to buying great birds one person knows what to look for is award-winning fifth generation master butcher danny lid gain poultry is a great meat because there's many different types of birds it's worth tasting the variation of flavours between different first to birds is massive turkey's a great lean meat that's available all year round not just for christmas anybody who's worried about eating fatty meats it's a really healthy flavoursome meal game birds people don't try them often enough once they're shot they're hung up for a little while but a few days at least it means the meat's going to be more tender it all adds flavor to the birds we've got a wood pigeon and a red leg partridge both really good and cook really quickly when you're buying a chicken some of the things to look out for is obviously the smell and when you're smelling a good quality chicken you can tell the difference the skin's a nice white color and it smells like a fresh chickeny smell when you're buying from a good butcher you'll find you tend to get the giblets as well which is basically the neck and other organs this is great for making gravy once you have cooked it you can use all the offcuts for other things stir-fries curries pasta dishes save the bones use the bones for stocks and soups a really packed full of flavor and remember there are lots of different breeds of chicken all have different characteristics and flavors so shop around and find the ones you love here are three of my all-time favorites the label anglais these come from an old british breed they've got smaller breasts but the meat's delicious the black leg a fantastic french variety succulent with bags of flavour and really meaty thighs and the pulley divorce this is the rolls royce of chickens rich gamey and delicious one for special occasions i think people should maybe try and buy less meat but aim for the best quality you're only going to get out what you put in by putting the best quality into a dish you're going to get the best results no matter how seasoned the chef you are there are always new ingredients and recipes to get fired up about so if a tired old recipe is getting you down spice it up with fresh ideas and flavors my next recipe is an old classic roast chicken but with a simple twist it takes on a new life and it's guaranteed to impress one of the things i love about cooking and it keeps me excited after 25 years behind the stove is that there's always something new to learn every day new ingredients new techniques and new cuisines start off with the stuffing [Music] it's amazing how exciting i stuffed roast chicken can be because it keeps the chicken incredibly moist and gives a delicious texture inside the bird i'm going to start off with cured ceriso this is a traditional spanish sausage and it's garlicky spicy incredibly meaty that gives a little bit of sort of richness to the stuffing get that cerezo in start cooking that down and getting all those oils out touch of olive oil in there to get it going right onions chopped add the onions to the cerezo and in a matter of seconds they'll change color as they soak up all the flavor that lovely spiciness has been stolen from that sausage now the onions smell incredible garlic garlicky fresh thyme just hold it down and put your fingers on there and it's a really nice way of taking off all those nice fragrant little time flowers you can hear it crackling in the background these are cannellini beans they're waxy very soft and so delicious but very dense but for stuffing they're so robust nothing breaks down drain them off in they're going to take on all that juice as well from this freezer i'm going to season them now because they're very dense so it needs some help i mean that looks like it's a dish on its own good enough to eat now i want to sweeten things up a little bit tomatoes half dried in that sweetens up the stuffing beautiful the stuffing's ready look at the color everything looks spanish it looks delicious now stuffing the chicken i like taking off these little knuckles as the chicken cooks the skin stretches over the bone you can get a really nice drum and take off those little wingtips as well salt pepper so important now you're stuffing i'm gonna go right inside the chicken push it down this really helps to cook the bird evenly because you're pushing out all the empty spaces in the carcass and take a nice large lemon push the lemon in pick up the person's nose pull the skin over olive oil on top salt and pepper a teaspoon of paprika sprinkle it on and then get your hands and sort of rub that in and see what the paprika is doing to the chicken putting this like sweet spicy marinade it's not even roasted yet but it looks delicious [Music] 400 ml of white wine same quantity of water that helps the chicken to steam chicken in be generous with the time sprigs [Music] make sure the fall is folded tightly around the roasting tray so the chicken steams in the oven keeping it moist and juicy into the oven [Music] cook for one hour at 180 degrees with a foil on nice take it out and remove the full lid then give it another 30 minutes to crisp up that skin look at that it's so important to make sure you take that tinfoil off with half an hour to go beautiful pierce that open squeeze it in that delicious gravy mix that into the tray and sieve that that's really nice fragrant lemony spiced roasting juices to finish before we cut up the chicken take out amazing stuffing [Music] incredible i'd have that with chicken over potatoes any day and then just get your chicken roasting juices now to cut the chicken up hold the drum and slice straight through and there's a wonderful drum and the thigh through the wishbone off slice with the point

with my delicious mushroom and leek pasta this fantastic fast and simple pasta dish made with everyday ingredients just goes to prove you can eat good food whenever you want really important put the water on first so you can just have it gently simmering away ready for the pasta while the water comes to the boil start the sauce by slicing mushrooms first off fingers one in front two behind up and down then add olive oil to a hot frying pan [Music] i want that nice color on the mushrooms off the heat literally 10 seconds and when you toss something really important you get all the ingredients at the end of the pan push down and pull back that noise that that's all the water coming out of the mushrooms next finely chop a fat clove of garlic [Music] then prepare your leeks just take your knife and go down through the center turn it over and again into quarters so you've got all that opening up and then just rinse the top of that to get rid of any potential dirt or sand it just breaks up into nice little quarters add all that leek into those mushrooms beautiful and now the secret is to get rid of that water inside the leek as it cooks down all the water's gone you just left that really nice intense flavor garlic's got nice and crispy now we're gonna add a touch of chicken stock in there beautiful lasagna sheets just gonna drop the sheets in to the water lasagna sheets are an unusual choice for a dish like this but they work brilliantly although any type of pasta you've got in the cupboard will do and just twist that pan that stops any pasta actually sticking to the bottom of the pan chicken stock would reduce down by half and it's almost delays at the bottom of the pan basically washed all that wonderful flavor off turn the gas down and add a couple of tablespoons of cream this just enriches the dish bring it back up to the ball and let it simmer for three to four minutes now the secret with the pasta is just taking it out a little early so you've got that nice texture hold up the sheet and just nip it and you can feel your fingers in the center it's ready turn the sauce down and lay these beautiful sheets of lasagna into that sauce i'm just gonna turn the gas off now and let the pasta sit in there and absorb that amazing sauce finish with chopped fresh tarragon it's a delicious herb it goes brilliantly well mushrooms and leeks just let that sit and almost sort of infuse to serve i'm making a quick bruschetta by toasting fresh chipata bread two nice slices drizzle that in olive oil a little bit of garlic just rub the bread the crust as well crust is what really takes that garlic now pan for the bread a little touch of olive oil as it starts to smoke bread in [Music] but look at the pasta now it's been stained by that amazing sauce to serve on

after the italian for butterflies this bow tied shaped pasta has a large surface area great for sticking to sauces just before the pasta is ready add frozen peas to the boiling past the water then

garlic and sweat until soft [Music] next remove the meat from your sausages by cutting open their skins and crumble into the pan fennel or sicilian sausages are perfect for this dish but any flavour sausage will do when the meat has browned add half cherry tomatoes season [Music] and add a few spoonfuls of the pasta cooking water as the starch thickens the sauce and helps it stick to the pasta drain the teglatelli and add to the sausage meat sauce [Music] finish with freshly grated parmesan [Music] perfect when you're really busy but still want great tasting food fast my amazing taglitelli

simply want something delicious to enjoy these are three amazing pasta recipes you can learn by heart and cook in minutes beautiful [Music] now here are five more of my essential cooking tips starting with how to cook an ingredient that's perfect for a quick and easy tv dinner chicken breasts this has to be the most popular part of the chicken now it's very versatile incredibly tender very lean hardly any fat whatsoever the secret is cooking it without it becoming dry the first thing is to season it properly both sides two tablespoons of olive oil get the pan nice and hot the secret now is to get a really nice color on the skin really nice color no color no flavor skin side down tilt the pan so it cooks the back of the chicken breast where it's really nice and round and very fat let the pan do the work chicken breast normally takes between sort of 10 and 12 minutes to cook properly now we've got the color on the skin the skin's nice and crispy we're going to deglaze the pan deglaze with masala now masala has a sweet fortified italian wine you can also use white wine masala in flambe burn off the alcohol which gets rid of that really sort of harsh alcoholic flavor roll the chicken around the masala the glaze in the pan basically means washing the pan and lifting off all that flavor stuck to the bottom of the frying pan and put it into the sauce now chicken stock bring that up to the boil and let it simmer for three to four minutes [Music] really important to leave the chicken breast skin side up the skin's nice and crispy and it's important that the chicken cooks from underneath as it starts cooking it absorbs the stock so in the center of the chicken stays nice and moist [Music] now the stock of the masala is reduced down it's gonna have the confidence to allow it to almost disappear and look the combination between the masala and the chicken stock is quite sweet so it finishes the chicken with this really nice delicious glaze on top and there you go a delicious succulent chicken breast with the most amazing flavoursome skin phenomenal soups make stunningly simple meals my tip for adding incredible depth of flavor is to always keep your leftover parmesan rinds store them in the freezer then add to the pan as the soup cooks and leaves to infuse then remove before serving it's less waste and more taste another tip to take homemade soup to the next level whisking cubes of cold butter just before serving to get a glossy velvety texture and a beautifully rich taste another fantastic standard for a frost-free weekend eat is the classic baked potato my tip for great crispy skin is to use salt to your advantage simply add it to the outside before cooking and the salt will draw out the moisture in the oven as it bakes a touch of salt gives you an amazingly crisp skin on chicken and fish too as well as highlighting the flavor [Music] home roasted nuts make a delicious tv snack my tip for peeling them with these is to simply toast them in the oven for about 10 minutes wrap in a tea towel and rub until the skins are removed perfect sprinkle with sea salt and so with a glass of wine this is my ultimate cookery course 100 recipes to stake your life on coming up i'll be showing you my amazing sweet corn fritters that is such a delicious recipe but first the key to whipping up my ultimate tv dinners is having a well-stocked store covered and even with the basics like tin sardines tomatoes pasta or rice it always pays to know how to buy the best next up my shopping guide to all things pasta when it comes to the sacred italian staple you'll be hard-pressed to find anyone who knows more than pastor supremo antonio i love pasta so much i have to eat it at least once a day he's been selling perfect pasta in london soho for over 35 years and eating great pasta for a lifetime to make the best place in the world italy takes away the past in italy and the people died you know and that's it for a good very good pasta you need two ingredients you need a good egg and very good flour and that's it this is a durum wheat flour look at that it's so soft does it cook so quick a couple minutes in a boiling water this thin like this couple minutes it's cool this shop is not it's not big enough to store all the type of pasta this is the famous spaghetto albronzo this is penne antonio's right there's a mind-blowing array of incredible pasta types that are great to keep in your store cupboard here's my quick guide to some of the different shapes and sizes and how to use them small shapes like farfallini are perfect for making simple stews and soups more substantial and add an extra texture to dishes like the classic italian pasta soup minestrone tubes like penne are great for thick cream or tomato based sauces as the rigid edges hold more sauce for an incredibly flavored packed mouthful long and thin like the store cupboard essential spaghetti the classic shape was invented in naples but every italian region has its own spaghetti dish from bolognese to carbonara or my favorite a lavongale which is spaghetti with delicious steamed clams flat noodles shaped strands like fettuccine are perfect with a simple drizzle of olive oil or in rich buttery dishes as a little sauce goes a long way coating the pasta evenly stopping the strands from sticking together then pass the sheets not just great for lasagnas but amazing rolled into tubes and filled to make delicious calalonie or used in quick supper dishes like my mushroom and leek pasta finally speciality pastas like this spaghetti made with squid ink has delicately sweet taste and an amazing jet black color great for when you want a delicious dinner that's a little bit different whatever shape you go for always look out for the pastas that have been bronze cut it means the dough was pressed through a bronze cutting dye which has a subtle rough texture which helps the sauce stick as well as all the dried types pasta also comes fresh which is brilliant for tv dinners because it cooks super quick and tastes incredible too in this shop we make pasta every day look at that that's beautiful it's sad to eat it this pasta is really really yellow because we use good quality of eggs you can smell the eggs they come through it's so good so fresh you can even eat it raw like that it lasts in the fridge two or three days you can even freeze it and you want chain taste whether fresh or dried pasta so versatile and quick to cook is the perfect tv dinner so go out stock up on new shaves and you'll soon be turning out dishes that would make pasta pro antonio very proud it looks so nice so good so healthy you know and that's it can resist we all lead busy lives but that doesn't mean you have to compromise when it comes to cooking great food for me the secret is having recipes you can depend on and a stalker full of staple ingredients that can be transformed into quick delicious dinners on demand so shop smart stock up and whether you're feeding 2 or 20 you'll always be ready to cook up something incredible my next tasty dish uses simple and cheap store cupboard ingredients with stunning results and takes minutes to make sweet corn fritters and yogurt dip it's brilliant to have a number of great recipes up your sleeve to rely on and let's be honest we've all got a tin of sweetcorn somewhere so i'm going to show you how to make the most amazing fritter [Music] first off the mixture take your flour sieve really important to sieve the flour that stops the mixture from having any lumps in there and just before you get to the end i want to put half a teaspoon of baking powder the baking powder gives the mixture some lift in and just sieve that through a touch of salt and pepper next an egg about four tablespoons of milk and give that a little whisk now just put a little drizzle of olive oil in there that helps to relax the mixture whisk that in make sure we got rid of all those lumps so that i want a nice smooth almost like a cake mixture okay next take the seeds out of a chili to lower the heat roll the chili so give it a really good shake [Music] tap them out slice in half into quarter and each quarter in half and chop through it's a really nice quick way of slicing a chili into the mixture spring onion take off that outside layer of the spring onion top and tail slice it in an angle it's a little bit

of delicious food that all centered around an asian staple noodles learn to cook those properly and you'd be surprised how quick and easy it is to knock off a delicious dinner first off we're gonna soak our noodles now these are rice noodles into a bowl and just pour the hot water over the rice noodles soak and rehydrate 12 to 15 minutes to soften up if you've got a wok perfect if not just a normal size frying pan with big sloping sides pan on get it really nice and hot chicken breast very lean hardly any fat on there you've got this little fillet just slice that off now the secret to getting it really nice and thin and to cut it into strips take your knife keep it nice and flat on the board and sort of slice it in half like a sort of scallop like that we call this butterfly in the chicken take a rolling pin and nice and gently roll over the chicken what it does it sort of flattens it allows you to slice it even thinner and the thinner the slices of the chicken the sort of crispier it gets the quicker it cooks slice it in half just start slicing these nice thin slices and the good news is one chicken breast can serve two or three easily next wash your knife and finally slice garlic the thinner the garlic the crispier this is a young tender broccoli just slice them down i want a bite to the broccoli and normally you sort of paste the dish with one-third noodles one-third vegetables and one-third of your protein chicken a dish that takes literally minutes to put together it's really important to get everything organized everything needs to be at your fingertips touch of olive oil get a pan really nice and ready just starting to smoke drop the chicken in first salt pepper open up those little strands of chicken nice [Music] once you've started to sear off the chicken get the garlic in now let that get really nice and crispy the way to do it is to sort of spread all the chicken the garlic up the side of the pan and see why it's so important to cut the chicken thin strips because it colors and cooks at the same time as well really really crucial now that garlic's getting really nice and crispy broccoli in feels strange putting raw broccoli in like that normally we'll blanch it in boiling water dry it out but you want that crunch now soy sauce that helps to season it but also stains beautifully soy sauce in lovely it's exactly what i want now take that out give your pan a little wipe out a little teaspoon of olive oil get that wok really nicely oiled again drain your noodles they're beautiful this is a really exciting way of finishing this quick stir fry very classic two eggs in [Music] whisk up the eggs and give that a really good whisk [Music] sort of almost spread it at the side of the pan lightly season the eggs noodles in chicken and broccoli in [Music] and give that a really nice mix you want the egg to sort of almost bring the dish together that egg's cooked make sure you've got that nice even distribution of chicken broccoli garlic lovely and then just finish that fresh lime and then you have a very simple delicious stir-fry with rice noodles [Music] homemade gnocchi making your enoki is so simple to do yet the results are absolutely stunning and it's a great way of using up leftover baked potatoes can make noki just with flour and eggs however the potato gives it a nice light sort of creamy fluffy texture cut them in half take your spoon and scoop the inside of those potatoes i'm using leftover baked potatoes but this really works as well with leftover ball potatoes two choices you can get a fork and sort of mash the potato and get it nice and light and fluffy or this little gadget is called a ricer i suppose it's a posh word for a potato masher just squeeze gently you can see how nice and light it is almost like fluffy little strands of potato you can do this when the potatoes are hot it'll go through the rice so much quicker just slice that off there now a nice spoon of okata ring a little touch of salt and pepper it's really important to season the mixture as we go along otherwise the nokia becomes really bland flour over the ricotta sieved so there's no lumps one delicious egg give that a little whisk now make a little well in the center you want a nice soft pliable ball of dough give that a really good mix get some thyme flowers in there and this time is light fragrant and it's just a really nice herb and with the ricotta it tastes brilliant just pick the little tips the time flowers next flour your hands generously and knead the mixture into a dough fold in and push and basically what it's doing is get it nice and smooth as it starts to get a little bit wet and just add a little touch of flour we want something really nice and soft now don't overwork it it stops the nokia from expanding when it hits the pan that's exactly what i want a nice sort of soft fragrant ball cut the ball in half lightly flour the hands and just roll it gently just think of a a big long cigar the mixture will start getting a little bit sort of wetter but do not add lots of flour now lightly flour the knife so when you slice the gnocchi it doesn't stick cut the dough into bite-sized pieces just take your finger dip it in the flour and push down why i want my knocking to look like a pillow and for me the most important part there is that not one of them are identically the same shape water on bring up to the boil little touch of olive oil in there lightly flour your hand lift up the nokia in to the rolling boiling water turn that pan to stop them from sticking at the bottom and let them simmer and they start to sort of tell you they're cooked when they start floating get a pan on get that nice and hot now they're just starting to come up to the top and you can continue cooking them like that i like blanching them in the water taking them out and then frying them to study the gnocchi heat olive oil in a frying pan gently lift up and look they've doubled in size drain it get rid of the excess water and straight in to the hot pan [Music] this is where they start to take on a completely different texture nice crisp sauteed texture on the outside nokia loves fresh pepper so pepper in [Music] you can see as i start turning them got this really nice little sort of brown color and they're almost popping up now like little parcels so i want them nice and sauteed both sides but light and creamy in the center fresh garden peas in and the butter gives it a really nice sort of bernoulli flavor on the end beautiful put a little bit of fresh thyme over the peas and then finally i want to lift it up fresh lemon zest the lemon over [Music] smells incredible and then finally seal the deal with a touch of grated parmesan cheese give your vegetable attitude and you'll get amazingly elegant dishes on a budget that are always guaranteed to impress what more do you want from great cooking cheap to make easy to cook and absolutely stunning spicy sausage rice whatever you're cooking the secret to making great food is to ensure you're locking every last ounce of flavour in that pan and this spicy sausage rice does exactly that take these spicy sausages and pierce that skin because i want all that delicious spicy sausage meat out of this casing and you get more flavor from the sausage when you take them out the casing sausage is ready turn on the gas bread onion less acidic than a big white spanish onion and a lot more flavoursome tablespoon of olive oil a tablespoon only because i want all that fat coming out the sausages to sort of really help flavor the onions onions in and the onions go in first because you can never rush cooking an onion it's really important to sort of give them five to six minutes in the pan so you can really start to caramelize them my mouth and my pepper slice around wasting nothing i want to see that sort of little core those pips in the center no fine diced pepper the rice is going to be cooking for 20 minutes so i want the veg to sort of have texture after it's cooked peppers in a bit of garlic two nice cloves just slap down off with the shell garlic in now i want to turn up the gas get the pan nice and hot because the minute that sausage goes in everything cools down and you'll end up boiling the peppers and the onions and the garlic so heat up to maximum and then just make a well in the center in now start stirring quickly this is where you get so much more bang for your buck out of sausages because the skins off and the real flavor of that spicy italian sausage is going to come through what's great about this recipe is that you can use any type of sausage to get the flavor and the heat you want i've gone for the spicy italian but it's just as good with merguez or cheeto a teaspoon paprika in give it that really nice smoky flavor rice in and we're going to sort of basically sear the rice we call it in the kitchen blasting the rice where we sort of soda the rice for 30 seconds and it takes on all that flavor next white wine so the wine sort of deglazes the pan and washes all that flavor from the bottom of the pan into the rice stock in bring it up to the boil turn it down and let it simmer [Music] double stop to rice turn that gas down and let it simmer for 12 to 15 minutes and just give it the occasional stir keep an eye on it now get ready to finish it slice spring onions diced sweet juicy tomatoes and roughly chop earthy flat leaf parsley spring onions in tomatoes in off with the gas really important otherwise everything becomes overcooked flat leaf parsley in but look at the volume in that pan now that is an amazing way to take spicy italian sausages to a completely different level beautiful [Music]

food whenever you want really important put the water on first so you can just have it gently simmering away ready for the pasta while the water comes to the boil start the sauce by slicing mushrooms first off fingers one in front two behind up and down then add olive oil to a hot frying pan [Music] i want that nice color on the mushrooms off the heat literally 10 seconds and when you toss something really important you get all the ingredients at the end of the pan push down and pull back that noise that that's all the water coming out of the mushrooms next finely chop a fat clove of garlic [Music] then prepare your leeks just take your knife and go down through the center turn it over and again into quarters see all that opening up and then just rinse the top of that to get rid of any potential dirt or sand it just breaks up into nice little quarters add all that leak into those mushrooms beautiful and now the secret is to get rid of that water inside the leek as it cooks down all the water's gone you just left that really nice intense flavor garlic's got nice and crispy now we're gonna add a touch of chicken stock in there beautiful lasagna sheets just gonna drop the sheets in to the water lasagna sheets are an unusual choice for a dish like this but they work brilliantly although any type of pasta you've got in the cupboard will do and just twist that pan that stops any pasta actually sticking to the bottom of the pan chicken start to reduce down by half and it's almost delayed the bottom of the pan basically washed all that wonderful flavor off turn the gas down and add a couple of tablespoons of cream this just enriches the dish bring it back up to the bowl and let it simmer for three to four minutes now the secret with the pasta is just taking it out a little early so you've got that nice texture hold up the sheet and just nip it and you can feel your fingers in the center it's ready turn the sauce down and lay these beautiful sheets of lasagna into that sauce i'm just going to turn the gas off now and let the pasta sit in there and absorb that amazing sauce finish with chopped fresh tarragon it's a delicious herb it goes brilliantly well mushrooms and leeks just let that sit and almost sort of infuse to serve i'm making a quick bruschetta by toasting fresh chipata bread two nice slices drizzle that in olive oil a little bit of garlic just rub the bread the crust as well crust is what really takes that garlic now pan for the bread a little touch of olive oil as it starts to smoke bread in [Music] but look at the pasta now it's been stained by that amazing sauce to serve i want a nice spoon of my mushrooms leeks and cream then i'll take my pasta just twist it and let it sit on top that tarragon has just lifted everything bread on and that's the beauty about something so simple that can be done in 20 minutes with everyday ingredients a stunning pasta dish adding easy and versatile dishes like this to your repertoire is what cooking at home is all about so my next tasty dish uses simple and cheap store covered ingredients with stunning results and takes minutes to make sweet corn fritters and yogurt dip it's brilliant to have a number of great recipes up your sleeve to rely on and let's be honest we've all got a tin of sweetcorn somewhere so i'm going to show you how to make the most amazing fritter [Music] first off the mixture take your flour sieve really important to sieve the flour that stops the mixture from having any lumps in there just before you get to the end i want to put half a teaspoon of baking powder the baking powder gives the mixture some lift in and just sieve that through a touch of salt and pepper next an egg about four tablespoons of milk and give that a little whisk now just put a little drizzle of olive oil in there that helps to relax the mixture whisk that in make sure we got rid of all those lumps so that i want a nice smooth almost like a cake mixture okay next take the seeds out of a chili to lower the heat roll the chilli so give it a really good shake [Music] tap them out slice in half into quarter and each quarter in half and chop through it's a really nice quick way of slicing a chili into the mixture spring onion take off that outside layer of the spring onion top and tail slice it in an angle it's a little bit of texture running through the mixture i want that nice crunch in coriander just slice through nice and gently and get that in there next to the sweetcorn now drain it from the tin and just pat it dry so it doesn't make the mixture too wet give that a nice mix you can see now i've got two thirds ingredients and one third of the mixture to bind together that's the secret of a good freitas so you're you're biting into excitement not sort of dough pan on olive oil in nice and hot get a nice big dessert spoon you know there's one nice portion in space the fritters evenly around the pan in a clockwise direction so you always know which one to turn first just with the back of your spoon sort of spread them out a little bit okay palette knife just check and happy with the color and turn over beautiful now for the chili yogurt dressing deseed and finely chop a red chili and add to a pot of natural yogurt and then some fresh lime [Music] finish with chopped coriander coriander in and give that a nice mix up that chilli just lifts it the lime gives it that nice tanginess the fritters they smell amazing and with the sauce it tastes fantastic that is such a delicious recipe using a tin of sweet corn from your cupboard amazing stir fry with rice noodles some of the best street food i've ever eaten was in asia every one of those little markets was filled with smells of delicious food that all centered around an asian staple noodles learned to cook those properly and you'll be surprised how quick and easy it is to knock off a delicious dinner first off we're gonna soak our noodles now these are rice noodles into a bowl and just pour the hot water over the rice noodles soak and rehydrate 12 to 15 minutes to soften up if you've got a wok perfect if not just a normal size frying pan with big sloping sides pan on get it really nice and hot chicken breast very lean hardly any fat on there you've got this little fillet just slice that off now the secret to getting it really nice and thin and to cut it into strips take your knife keep it nice and flat on the board and sort of slice it in half like a sort of scallop like that we call this butterfly in the chicken take a rolling pin and nice and gently roll over the chicken what it does it sort of flattens it allows you to slice it even thinner and the thinner the slices of the chicken the sort of crispier it gets the quicker it cooks slice it in half start slicing these nice thin slices and the good news is one chicken breast can serve two or three easily next wash your knife and finely slice garlic the thinner the garlic the crispier this is a young tender broccoli just slice them down i want a bite to the broccoli and normally you sort of paste the dish with one-third noodles one-third vegetables and one-third of your protein chicken with a dish that takes literally minutes to put together it's really important to get everything organized everything needs to be at your fingertips touch of olive oil get a pan really nice and ready just starting to smoke drop the chicken in first salt pepper open up those little strands of chicken nice [Music] once you've started to sear off the chicken get the garlic in now let that get really nice and crispy the way to do it is to sort of spread all the chicken the garlic up the side of the pan and see why it's so important to cut the chicken thin strips because it colors and cooks at the same time as well really really crucial now that garlic's getting really nice and crispy broccoli in feels strange putting raw broccoli in like that normally we'll blanch it in boiling water dry it out but you want that crunch now soy sauce that helps to season it but also stains beautifully soy sauce in lovely it's exactly what i want now take that out give you a pan a little wipe out a little teaspoon of olive oil get that wok really nicely oiled again drain your noodles they're beautiful this is a really exciting way of finishing this quick stir fry very classic two eggs in [Music] whisk up the eggs and give that a really good whisk [Music] sort of almost spread it at the side of the pan lightly season the eggs noodles in chicken and broccoli in [Music] and give that a really nice mix you want the egg to sort of almost bring the dish together that egg's cooked make sure you've got that nice even distribution of chicken broccoli garlic [Music] lovely and then just

i've loved it ever since i was a kid and to make it even more delicious i've given it a few modern tweaks for my ultimate fish i'm doing the best crunchiest lightest batter imaginable with a hint of ginger to go with it chilly minted mushy peas [Music] in order to make sure that the batter stays nice and crispy and the fish stays nice and firm the secret is to season the fish salt and pepper that will draw out the moisture and that will keep the fish really nice and firm put it in the fridge for around 10 minutes to let the seasoning work its magic now the batter as always when making any batter always sieve the flour i want a bit of heat in the batter so a nice teaspoon of cayenne pepper season the flour salt and pepper and then two teaspoons of baking powder this almost lightens the load with the batter now ginger beer it gives that batter this sort of unique spicy individual flavor it's delicious with a fish and a nice tablespoon of oil just basic vegetable oil gives it a nice sheen give it a good mix you really want it almost like the consistency of double cream too thin and the batter runs off especially when it hits the fryer too thick and it actually prevents the fish from getting cooked so you've got to get it to that just that sort of double cream texture let it rest for as long as possible to give you an even textured batter now the season should have worked its magic and drawn out the excess moisture from the fish so it's on to the next stage fish has gone slightly firmer perfect for frying start by coating the fish in flour seasoned with pepper pat that nice and dry into your hands so you haven't got any excess flour the flour stops the batter from running off the fish i'm just gonna check to see if my oil's ready by putting a little touch of batter into the fryer you see it bubbling straight to the very top that tells you that the oil is ready never really ever fill the pan above halfway if the oil starts to get too hot first thing you do turn off the gas second thing add some oil into it to cool it down hold the fish by the corner unless you put it in and roll it round then gently slap the fish on the sides of the bowl to get rid of excess batter now in and lay away and just gently drop it in twist your pan that stops it from sticking at the bottom oil should be gently sort of bubbling away but notice as we're frying the fish there's no spitting of any water from the fish fry the fish for three to five minutes gently turning halfway through once the batter is golden and crisp it's ready look they look stunning it's like these big crispy pillows of beautifully textured cotton leave the fish to rest on a kitchen towel to blot excess oil meanwhile it's quick and easy chilli minted mushy peas now how much you peas a little teaspoon of olive oil and a nice knob of butter into the pan shallot finely chopped that adds a bit of sweetness to the peas slots into the pan chili these are delicious when you eat peas and they're slightly spicy they're even better garlic in the peas sweat off the chilli the garlic and the schlotz before the peas join those spices simply blanch and salted boiling water infuse with their perfect partner fresh mint stalks and all and then put your frozen peas in now what's the peas i've got nice and soft drain them now take off the stalks and then add your peas to the shallots i love that sound mix all that chili and garlic in there a little seasoning finishing the frozen peas off like this absolutely delicious onto your board crush now you cannot beat crushed delicious peas look at that those peas is incredible top with chopped mint chilli minted mushy peas so simple and perfect with easy ginger beer battered fish a nice spicy crispy batter and that just reaffirms the importance of comfort food if you're gonna do it do it properly [Music] my spicy twist is proof you can update a comforting classic and the best way to eat this is with crispy buttered sauteed potatoes cooked with garlic rosemary and thyme to take this happy food to a whole new level [Music] when i was growing up food in britain was somewhat different to what it is now no one had heard of organic you could even buy avocados in the shops where i lived paris kitchens might have been cooking nouvelle cuisine but it certainly hadn't made any inroads around our way moulton at lunch when i was growing up was very plain pretty trashy but i still love it now and again fish fingers with a delicious chip butty the secret of a good chip butti is in the potato now these are desiree potatoes one of my first ever jobs was working in a chip shop i used to put sacks and sacks of potatoes into the rumbler which was then the potato peeler all day long today i'm gonna do something a bit healthier for my oven chips with a twist simply peel slice and blanch for three to four minutes drain season and cover well with propeca spread evenly over an oiled baking tray and place into a preheated oven for 20 minutes simple as that next up easy fish fingers this is pollock a really nice firm delicious fish got the fish in finger size batons of fish put them onto your plate and just lightly salt them you can do that literally 20 minutes 30 minutes before you start cooking the fish it firms the fish up beautifully and it allows it to become a little more durable especially in the pan now for the coating start by thoroughly coating the fish in seasoned flour and then just roll it to get rid of those little sharp corners because then it stops those corners almost burning in the pan in to your egg wash and really coat them wonderful and then this is dill goes brilliantly well with a fish and run the dill through my breadcrumbs that makes it more aromatic lay them onto your breadcrumbs nothing wrong with the chip butty nothing wrong with fish fingers just give it a lovely modern twist beautiful once the fish fingers are thoroughly coated they're ready to pan fry and they'll need around three minutes on each side i want the fish fingers to be nice and crispy get a really nice color on them first and then we'll flip them over and finish them with butter bring the heat up into the pan and a nice little knob of butter that'll work wonders with the breadcrumbs and the dill nice and carefully take them out and look and smell incredible so nice and crispy now to assemble my chip butty starting with butter thick crusty bread [Music] slice of bread mop up that amazing flavor on slice in half never slice in an angle my mouth is salivating beautiful on with the ship buddy there's one thing missing and it signifies that i've never forgotten the joy i've come for food but my god that makes me feel like a nine-year-old excuse me for one moment when want to stuff my face [Applause] [Music] homemade fish fingers and my ultimate chip buddy so simple to make but trust me it tastes amazing boiled eggs with a soldier that will make your taste buds stand to attention there's something quite nostalgic about a bald egg it's something that's never lost it's magic when you slice that top off and dunk that soldier into the yolk you can't mess with a deliciously runny yolk but this is what i like to dunk in it an anchovy soldier anchovies interpersonal water no salt naturally yeah anchovies are very salty so just a touch of pepper in omega-3s the amazing tinned anchovy is a natural flavor enhancer and i use it to pepper many a savory dish from roast lamb to the humble toasted soldier grind them it's a really nice smooth paste the smell of that is almost like being at the seaside now get your soft butter and just put half the butter in first 50 50 is the way 50 percent anchovy 50 butter that way got that real nice salty creaminess mix that up that's absolutely delicious trust me finishing that anchovy butter on a slice of grilled fish i'm in heaven the bread this is a sourdough delicious very crusty take four nice slices now get that pan nice and hot a couple of tablespoons of that anchovy oil into the pan and then get your bread and lightly fry each side the smell of the anchovy oil is incredible take that out now bring your water up to the boil the secret of softly boiling an egg is to place them into the water gently on a spoon in and just tilt so they don't hit the bottom nice and light up to the boil count to five turn the gas down is it four and a half minutes is it five minutes for a softball day i've cooked thousands of them and every time it's four and a half minutes whilst that's boiling get your bread and spread that on there that is incredible chopped parsley brings that kind of freshness goes brilliantly well with the anchovies hear that crunch on inside but i can't resist oh my god right gas off one beauty in two i feel like a five-year-old again this is that moment when you open the vault and that little magic inside is all yours there's a great twist on a great classic wow [Music] perfectly soft boiled eggs with dressed up anchovy butter soldiers who would have thought that egg and soldiers could be that delicious [Music] you

home one of my golden rules for producing fantastic food is learning to cook with confidence this recipe is so straightforward but tastes absolutely amazing pan on get that nice and hot you think of the sort of density of a pork chop how it needs a little bit of help sweet sound peppers go brilliantly well first slice the peppers that's the flat side of the pepper so stand it up trying to slice a pepper on the side is a nightmare there's the center start off it's almost like sort of peeling an orange go all the way around and down and look that's what you want now place the pepper down three finger rule one finger in front two behind pinky holding it down thumb holding it nice and flat the flatter the vegetables the more confident you are when you slice so don't worry about the speed just let the knife do the work and take your time speed comes the most important thing is to get your technique right red onion now sweet sour peppers olive oil in i'm going to saute them which is just the chef's turn for shallow frying on a high heat for maximum taste some salt and pepper add a tablespoon of sugar sugar helps to break down the peppers quicker but caramelise the onions frying them in a frying pan perfect it's one of the sort of basic essential tools of any kitchen because it's so multi-purpose great for sauteing tossing great for cooking fish on meat push away and pull back push away and pull back that hissing is something you need to hear constantly because the minute that's gone your peppers and your onions start to boil and you really want them to soak in you now start to see glistening in a way that it's starting to caramelize sugar's working beautifully that's ready for the red wine vinegar in smells incredible it helps to stain the peppers as well look at the glaze now you can see the sugar it's worked as magic turn down the gas and add a couple of tablespoons of fresh extra virgin olive oil let them stew for two to three minutes now i want to make the peppers nice and light and sort of sweet aromatic just roll the basil almost like a big cigar slice basil in and then literally cook it out for 30 seconds i want them off beautiful okay pan back on now for the pork chops i want to make sure they don't curl up in the pan they start curling up in the pan they're going to cook unevenly a few simple cuts through the rind means the chop stays flat and cooks evenly point the knife down flip through this seasoned beautifully nice large shards of pepper punch that through lightly guaranteed that seasoning is gonna stay there hot pan touch garlic and touch of thyme and the garlic take a couple of cloves don't peel it don't chop it just knife on crush it olive oil in just starting to smoke top of the chop in and lay away from me nice keep that heat in the pan put the garlic in there early a nice fragrant bunch of thyme see how the pork is staying nice and flat turn that over look at that beautiful i want a little bit of thyme underneath there start squeezing that garlic out i want the flavor coming out butter in thin slices of butter tilt the pan and baste so i'm sort of speeding up the cooking process at the same time i'm keeping the pork chop really nice and moist and now look at the color that butter it's almost like sort of a nut brown check the color on the other side useful when they're that thick three and a half to four minutes each side 30 seconds from now they're going to be medium so i'm going to take them out and let them rest the secret to perfectly moist pork chops is letting them rest almost as long as they're cooked in the pan [Music] a nice spoon of these peppers the basil smells incredible keep that garlic on there be generous with that vinaigrette from the peppers because it really is incredible do two things simple like that pork and peppers and your confidence is gonna shoot through the roof a stunning pork chop with sweet and sour peppers my next recipe can be kept on tap in the fridge for weeks on end and is guaranteed to liven up any quick meal spicy chutney with chutney standing by in the fridge you can always add that special little touch to a simple supper prove that thinking ahead always pays off pan on start toasting those spices keep the pan nice and low cumin very aromatic very fragrant and it's almost like a light spice next nice little coriander seeds coriander in now you're going to get a bit of heat in the chutney mustard seeds well smaller than coriander seeds but so much more powerful mustard seeds in now curry leaves they don't actually smell much dry but the flavor they give off is extraordinary kodi's in really important not to burn them otherwise you'll have that bitter taste across the chutney keep the gas nice and low the secret is sort of toasting them so it releases that oil and intensifies the spice touch of salt and then a couple small powerful chilies keep them whole no one's gonna eat them but it gives that real nice burst of heat now let them toast gently there we're not gonna chop the onion we're gonna grate it why because it sort of breaks down to a really nice puree in the chutney when you're grated hold the root in the palm of your hand and just push nice long grates i want those nice long shards look i've almost got a nice sort of onion puree but it's nice and clear a touch of olive oil spices nicely toasted onions in [Music] three nice cloves of garlic lightly crushed them [Music] lay it nice and flat and just slice the garlic nice thin slices garlic in taking your time to get the owners caramelised beautifully will really reap rewards in the long run tamarind paste and sugar in with the sugar first three nice tablespoons of sugar that will give a really nice syrup effect sort of nice rich syrupy texture to the chutney tamarind paste you can get tamarind paste in most delis and the big supermarkets it's really nice thickening asian but it gives that tartness the chutney and it's sort of rich sugary spicy next in with my coconut add four nice tablespoons that will give a nice body and a really nice texture to the chutney cook that coconut out and now add the carrot grated the carrot just gives the chutney a really nice sort of crunch but also helps to sort of cool down the spice carrots in the water comes out the carrot flavors the chutney beautifully but gives that nice sort of vibrant bright color to it as well and grating it almost sort of it cooks instantly but i want a bit of texture through here turn down the gas and just let that simmer for five minutes if the carrots aren't that moist and juicy then put a couple of tablespoons of water in there to help it along now just cook that out for five minutes just as those carrots start going nice and soft don't overcook them you want that nice texture in there slightly spicy slightly sweet gas off keep those chillies in there for that it's beautiful nice and gooey delicious and ready to go in this jar as that sits in the fridge just gets better and better and better i love to eat this chutney with cold meats or even cold fish but with ham it's amazing it's a really nice way of living up the ham just sort of roll it up get a nice spoon of chutney i mean it looks fantastic chutney onto the plate and serve and that is a nice little gem in the fridge that is worth prepping in advance for first off start with the dough tip 500 grams of strong bread flour into a mixing bowl and add 20 grams of semolina that gives the vacation it's sort of rustic charm now there's one thing for catcher needs it's really good seasoning you can't season bread after it's baked so it's got to go in right at the very beginning sprinkling 15 grams of dried yeast take some warm water and then 50 mils of olive oil top of that water that gives it this really nice silky rich texture make a little well mix up that yeast water and oil in start off with your fingers keep your fingers nice and open it's like a little sort of whisk going in there i'm looking for a really nice sort of relaxed dough now that's just starting to come together touch more water with oil in there give a little swirl and then again the secret is to sort of knead it gently don't overwork it it's a sort of easy bread to make a nice one to start off with when you're making bread for the first time basically kneading means just knit it together just hanging lightly flour your board and let's just knead that focaccia into a nice smooth dough make sure you don't over add too much flour otherwise it sort of dries out the dough something quite magical about making bread you can switch off and lose yourself my first job for a three-mission style establishment was a baker i was 22 years of age i usually start at midnight i was under such a tight schedule one o'clock white bread then two o'clock brown bread three o'clock sourdough four o'clock cheese bread five o'clock proof bake six o'clock crack them open and taste it was amazing beautiful yeah looks stunning it hasn't even risen yet leave your dough to rise in a warm place until it's doubled in size we call this proving [Music] that beautiful a lot of chefs sort of need it for the second time but i'm looking for a really nice light aerated for catcher take your tray a touch of olive oil in there season it at the bottom really important that's the exciting thing about focaccia you've got that really nice sort of salty top and salty bottom and just with a touch of olive oil on your hands gently push that in and almost massage it into the corners it's possible to put sort of olives and tomatoes and garlic through the dough but it never really allows the dough to sort of aerate properly when you put so much ingredients in i'm gonna stick mine on top use your finger and sort of just push them in salt on top some pepper on top as well i want some nice fresh amazing rosemary just hold the stalk and just pull off and then just sprinkle down generous in the rosemary really important to have that nice fragrance on top of the fuckache finish it off before it goes in with a little drizzle of olive oil so it almost sinks in those little pockets of flavor olive tomato rosemary and olive oil into the oven bake your focaccia at 200 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes [Music] smells delicious [Music] beautiful [Music] you can hear how crispy that is you can't beat a nice warm fresh slice of home-cooked focaccia it's rustic charming and it's the perfect way to start baking making homemade for catcher it's so addictive you

dishes are always the simplest these crumpets are absolutely delicious and it's a great end to a fantastic brunch first off we're gonna make the mix when you think of growing up the smell and the taste of amazing crumpet it never leaves you to make the mix the secret is to bring the milk up the ball but do not boil it the minute it boils turn it off and let it sit there now flour in a nice pinch of salt in now add half a teaspoon of bicarb that gives it aeration and really lifts the mixture up all those lovely little holes a nice pinch of sugar and then a teaspoon of yeast dry yeast now once the milk's boiled turn it off and add some warm water about 10 tablespoons 150 ml that cools down the milk but more importantly it doesn't destroy the yeast half of the milk in first stop and give that a really good mix now the rest of it [Music] [Music] you can just see that there's no lumps through there as it drips through the whisk now we're looking for it to double in size and get nice and light so pop in a warm place whilst you get on with the delicious topping [Music] beautiful strawberries but caramelised almost like a very quick strawberry jam hang on [Music] just slice these in half some sugar a couple of tablespoons we're gonna take the sugar to a nice light caramel it's just starting to change color now turn the gas down and we're gonna add the strawberries beautiful just sweating the strawberries down quickly and the caramels breaking down a wonderful glaze on the strawberries some lemon grated into the strawberries gives it that kind of freshness that really starts to break down the strawberries nice gas up smells incredible some lemon juice a touch of balsamo vinegar in that gives it that really nice delicious tartness now off it goes as the strawberries start to cool down it will naturally thicken and set beautifully nice [Music] now for the crumpet it's almost doubled in size but be very careful you don't knock the bowl because it can sort of push out all that air it's aerated it's nice it's light just see the texture she's ready to go did you boil it here we go instead of making normal small crumpets i'm making a giant one ideal for sharing now turn the gas down you just start to see a traditional crumpet style cooking process we want those nice tiny little holes on top and then crispy crunchy base right now it's time to add the butter just slide the butter down the back that gives it a really nice nutty flavor at the end fish nice flip beautiful take that out take the jam spoon the secret is for the juice to sort of run inside all those little holes think of that tartness of the balsamic vinegar the strawberries beautifully soft and almost pureed wrapped in that delicious caramel now finish that with a nice ball of creme fraiche and let that sit there and that is an amazing way of finishing off a traditional brunch with something sweet something delicious and something you're dying to tuck into [Music] soft fiery and irresistible spicy pancakes one of the secrets to good cooking is learning to use your imagination when it comes to brunches you don't have to stick to the old standbys these delicious spicy pancakes are really great alternative but more importantly so easy to do start off by toasting your cumin [Music] it's a dry roast basically non-stick pan just a touch of seasoning the salt helps to dry out the cumin even more and then fresh ginger slice them nice and thinly stack it back up and then just slice nice little thin slices in there and then keep that bunched up shake the chilli removing the seeds will prevent things getting too hot now garlic nice now add olive oil to your toasted cumin seeds and then with the garlic ginger and chili lovely [Music] and it feels strange when you talk about garlic for breakfast but the time i spent in india everybody was eating something savory for breakfast it was extraordinary into your bowl and set aside next the pancake filling add olive oil to a hot pan mustard seeds in now they'll start dancing the minute they hit the pan then finely slice an onion onions in a little teaspoon of turmeric sprinkle that in and look at the color an instant change leftover potatoes just slice them the smell is incredible potatoes in now spread the potatoes across the pan on the potatoes stained i want them sort of absorbing all that really nice turmeric actually like a sponge season those potatoes and it really helps to bring out the spice beautifully they're ready turn off the gas and let them sit there and absorb all those flavors back to the pancake batter add plain flour to your cooled garlic chili ginger and cumin seeds touch with salt and pepper nothing worse than the bland pancake one whole egg milk hold the jug with one hand and whisk we have a secret to get that really nice smooth paste but whisking that egg first and brings it together and then you're milking don't put all the milk in because then you're gonna get a lumpy pancake mix and if you put less milk in it really helps it not going lumpy look at that milk here and the secret for me is to have a nice thin mix now just a little teaspoon of oil that helps to bring a nice crispy edge to the mixture now just taste that's the texture pan on the larger the pan the better it helps to create a nice thin even surface i want that mix going all the way around the pan before you put the mixture into the pan make sure you give your pancake mix a really nice stir pan it's nice and hot turn down the gas a touch of olive oil in get that nice whisk with one hand pan to the mix in one and a half ladles and then roll it around so it's really nice and thin i want to see the ginger the garlic that's what i'm looking for in there now back onto the heat it only starts to remove from the bottom of the pan and lifts itself up once it's cooked these little bubbles confirm that it's just starting to lift off the pan a little shake that releases it and then just shake it to the end and toss if you haven't got the confidence tossing then use a spatula and turn it over now that's exactly what i want that nice sort of crisp edge around the side the color on the pancake is so important now roll it round and just let it slide out beautifully now for the exciting part filling them take your potatoes just sort of have a really nice imaginary line and then just very carefully roll that nice and tightly tuck it underneath there pull it back and roll useful the delicious pancakes are ready to eat but with a simple dipping sauce there'll be a real treat just mix chopped coriander with natural yoghurt that's really nice cooling asian sit there on the side and that for me is a great brunch delicious spicy pancakes amazing you

day in the restaurant and on the other hand there was the food you ate in people's homes which is a lot simpler to make but still absolutely delicious my ultimate french-inspired lunch is very light bright and really takes me back to when i lived in paris it's my take on the salad nicoise served with a delicious ghost cheese and pear tartine think of the nicoise as an assembly job of delicious ingredients brought together with a fantastic dressing the secret behind my salad nicoise is in the dressing spoon dijon mustard into a pestle and mortar some people top the salad with anchovies and capers but in mine they're the base to the dressing we're gonna grind that to a paste and then get the garlic in there season well with black pepper it doesn't need any salt in there because of the anchovies add a couple tablespoons of red wine vinegar olive oil and lastly flat leaf parsley to give the dressing freshness against those deep flavors it's a thick rich substantial dressing dressing done now for the salad ball potatoes green beans and eggs from a rolling ball seven and a half to eight minutes you should keep that nice yolky creamy texture in the center once the eggs are ready put them into cold water to stop them cooking and this is a great trick to peel them so much easier peeling eggs when you use the water that they've been cooling down in and the water will seep underneath all the shell so the whole shell just gets peeled off with one beautiful big layer now beans nice and crunchy season the beans and potatoes whilst they're still warm so they absorb more flavor a little drizzle of olive oil salt pepper and just let them sit there whilst the potatoes and beans cool down i'm doing a simple french open sandwich which is called a tartine this is delicious first i'm toasting baguette on the griddle lightly oil your griddle pan get your bread stick it on there take a pear it goes brilliantly well with goat's cheese slice the pear into finger width pieces that's the color we're looking for that dark crispy texture now for the ghost cheese give it a season it doesn't need salt because a little fresco cheese is already quite salty then a handful of crumbled walnuts they go under the grill whilst they put the tuna nice ones together my secret to assembling a great nicoise salad is to start in the middle of the plate and add ingredients layer by layer there's one thing i'm always missing the bottom of salad is dressing so i like to put it on the plate first baby gem lettuce is great because it's robust and holds that heavy dressing then add firm waxy salad potatoes and green beans i like them to have a bit of a crunch canned tuna can be fantastic i'm using a good quality one in olive oil which has been drained next baby plum tomatoes which have a lovely intense sweet flavor and then my eggs that nice dark rich yolk beautiful [Music] yogurt's still creamy inside he's a little olive nicoise this will work just as well with other black olives and then you're dressing drizzle that round gently beautiful that is a nicoise in heaven now tartine wow just a smell of those grilled walnuts that is beautiful a simple but very elegant tuna nicoise but delicious goat's cheese sandwich wonderful [Music] my vibrant and gutsy nisswa salad with that incredible anchovy and caper dressing served with a pear and goat's cheese tartine too good to let the french keep all to themselves [Music] a stunning prawn and cucumber salad with a spicy yogurt dressing a simply delicious anchovy dip and a sticky chocolate fridge cake that won't fail to revive a flag in family until he's keen to get in on the action [Music] what are your favorites a marshmallow and peanut fridge cake perfect for a picnic first things first you have to slowly melt the chocolate that's bad that's good i'm gonna break up the chocolate right in there next butter goes in couple tablespoons of golden syrup it's so good if we melt chocolate too quickly it starts to separate and destroy the best and safest way to melt chocolate is always use a bain-marie but i'm going to keep a really close eye on mine and heat it over a super low heat this stunning little cake has your favorites in there our digestives now put your hands in there and give them like that one at a time ago and crush what's the one thing that you love about a picnic i love eating outside especially on a nice summery day not so much in the winter no that's going to be the crunchy part of our fridge cake and it's called a fridge cake because it can sit in the fridge or you can freeze it now the peanuts in please can you use it without peanuts if you're allergic to peanuts oh you can do yeah definitely no what are these little babies cranberries cranberries from there marshmallows my favorite okay they're so bright aren't they why do you love marshmallows so much because they're so squishy all right give that a nice mix up chocolate is melting nicely okay i want you to pour that in and i'll mix it nice and gently slowly slowly slowly soon nice now touch more please good isn't it good give that a little mix with daddy please look they're all melty and nice and cool and gooey now we're going to line the tray so this is quite easy to make because um you don't have to bake it you just set it yeah i want you to start pushing it into the corners please with your fingers just laying out nice and flat ah it's all nice and marshmallow and oozy to get the spatula okay and look how delicious does that look really delicious i can eat it right now i couldn't because it's not set so when that sets okay it'll go nice and firm and then we can cut it into little bars little squares triangles triangles [Music] good but the important part of pushing it down is that we can slice it and the more we push the thinner we can slice okay good good [Music] fridge cake done now i'm gonna make the most amazing anchovy dip with vegetables and bread first cut slices of baguette and bake in the oven at 180 degrees c for six minutes or until crisp meanwhile roughly chop garlic and shallots and add to a food processor along with a tin of good quality anchovies sprinkle in some pitted black olives flat leaf parsley and drizzle in the reserved anchovy oil and a little olive oil blitz to a paste and add pepper then decant into a jar ready to transport serve with a handful of fresh baby carrots peppery radishes and your crisp baguette toast anchovy dip a portable and deliciously palatable alfresco treat [Music] now a spicy chili yogurt dressing with a prawn salad first things first i'd like you to make the dressing fish doesn't sauce smell like fishes so one and a half tablespoons of fish sauce two chilli i like this especially if you have it on the side of the pork little teaspoon of sugar oh that's it good in so four tablespoons of yogurt three four some zest in there why are you making it in a jam jar not a bowl well this is for a little picnic and it's a great way of transporting we squeeze the lime in there and then we put the lid on shake it and then i want you to shut it on tight [Music] come on it's a bit like a tummy see that sounds like my tummy only sometimes only sometimes thank you for that hi nick is you and the first time you have it's like a little thingy it's fresh salty citrusy but delicious now cucumber and the salad i want to get rid of all the seeds so if you just nice and gently peel the cucumber why do you feel it can you not eat the skin on it you can eat the skin but i want this salad to taste light and fresh you can use a knife for this too though can't you you can peel with a knife but a speed peeler takes off the slices nice and thinly so much quicker so much quicker that's why it's called a speed peeler looks better now looks a bit naked it does look a bit naked doesn't it now you get your spoon and see what happens a teaspoon just takes out all those seeds so whilst it sits in the dish it doesn't make the salad go all soft because that cucumber is nice and crunchy [Music] that's really good there you go so see where your knuckles are there that's what's always going to protect if you put that little finger out this little piggy boom comes off what did i tell you about daddy's knuckle that's the first place you cut off all the time there you go the next addition to our prawn salad is firm juicy baby gem lettuce look at the lettuce in half what about the butt the butts [Music] i'm keeping the butts on for now so when i slice it it stays together okay and then a little bit there we don't use okay when you prepare lettuce for picnic you never slice it too thinly okay otherwise it will it's good prawns already [Music] your tummy sauce is ready your dressing is ready take the lid off and the trick is you dress the bottom of your dish because i'm going to put the prawns on here to protect the lettuce get your cucumber i put my cucumber on and then finally that is okay now the salad's not gonna go soft why is that because it's not that it's not straight onto the dressing that's right what happens is we wrap this now and then we get to our picnic drizzle the sauce on top we mix it up we've got the dressing on the bottom and the dressing on top of the dressing on top that's right a little bit of tim film do you know the cling film trick i don't know the clip field trick yet no things fell over the top of the toilet what you don't understand it when you're my age oh you've been my age then well okay salad in the fridge with the dressing ready to go for a picnic this is my ultimate picnic dinner feast prawn and cucumber salad with a spicy yogurt dressing anchovy dip with crudites and the kids favorite chocolate marshmallow and peanut fridge cake

outstanding brunches i love brunch it's a great way of relaxing with friends and family not taking yourself or anything else too seriously and brunch dishes should reflect that spicy sweet or savoury anything goes and one of my all-time favorites a dish that always creates a stir is the daddy of all brunches steak sandwiches [Music] for me the secret of a great brunch is fun and casual fuss-free cooking and everyone helping themselves this is the ultimate steak sandwich you want the rolls royce of beef it has to be fill it now season it beautifully i like to open up the top of the peppermill to increase the size of the pepper in the steak so it gives that bit of heat nice little chunks you just roll now nicely all the way around now slice the garlic in half pan nice and hot olive oil in [Music] hold the steak and just place it into the pan don't drop it at the front of the pan we're going to tilt the pan forward to cook the back of the steak dual purpose now roll it back and sear underneath next my garlic and roast that garlic time fry that time i want to hear it we're not looking for a lot of color because you're going to dry out the fill it so just one end turn it back down and stir the other end in lift up your time place it on top of the garlic there lift up your fillet and sit there on top of your garlic butter in take a spoon tilt the pan gently lift up and baste i've got that scented garlic thyme flavor the steak is going to cook evenly because it's sat on a little a little bed in the oven for 8 to 10 minutes [Music] pan on for the relish you think of a steak sandwich you think of a sort of nice heated tomato relish to make the relish finely dice a red onion three finger rule one in front two behind through and chop wow next roughly chop a chili keeping the seeds in for extra heat start off with the olive oil into a pan onions chili generous with the olive oil i want a nice sort of rich silky relish from there take your tomatoes you can't just use red tomatoes but these yellow and red make the perfect combination now put your salt in pepper and then roast those tomatoes off take a wooden spoon and just sort of break them up once the skins blister the whole tomato just starts to release all that really nice sweet texture a little teaspoon of cherry vinegar gives that nice acidic balance the sweetness of the tomatoes turn down the gas and just let them sort of stew perfectly now a steak sandwich would not be complete unless it had the most amazing mustard mayonnaise simply add three tablespoons of mayonnaise to three teaspoons of whole grain mustard [Music] now i've got the reddish almost down to like a really nice jam now i want to make that relish a little bit more fragrant some basil slice it through sprinkle that basil in there [Music] beautiful look at this there she is my crown jewels time to take it out smell is incredible just based one more time to fill it touch is quite soft in the center so it's just coming up to mid-rare let it rest at the same time you cooked it it'll be nice and pink evenly throughout the steak to make my sandwich i'm going to char grill some sliced chipatta bread season it nicely just a little drizzle of olive oil i want to get that bread nice and crispy pan nice and hot bread in push it down smell is amazing that char sort of charcoal flavor once you've got those marks on the bread it just stops the bread from becoming soggy and look at this here it is stunning on slice it gently one beautiful slice wow it's nice and pink all the way through and the beef is so soft it's almost like slicing through butter let the knife do the work take a little bit of mayonnaise spread that the back of the spoon on both sides next lettuce take that beautiful slice of beef and then relish on top of that beef and just slice the sandwich in half beautiful now that's what i call a steak sandwich trust me sir the sublime sandwich for brunch and you'll put a smile on everyone's face [Music] next up my guide to buying the best beef and steaks if you want the ultimate brunch you can't do any better than start with a perfect steak and one man who really knows his steak is master butcher danny lidgate steak is my favorite type of meat and i think it's really good to enjoy different varieties of steak when choosing a steak that you want you need to look at exactly what you want out of it for my ultimate steak sandwich i used to fill it because it's the most tender the fillet does the least amount of work than all the other mussels it's tucked away in the rib cage this means that when you find a fillet it's incredibly soft like butter it's the most expensive but you get what you pay for there's a wide array of cuts to choose from all different in taste and texture if in doubt ask your butcher this would be the rump section where the rump comes from which is basically the back side take the bone out and what you're left with is a wonderful steak rum steak characteristically a little bit tougher than the sirloin or a little bit chewier than the ribeye but a really strong flavor for the steak again when frying rum look for the marbling try and get some fat covering on the steak you can always cut it off after it's cooked rumps one of the best value steaks i love it thinly cut them flesh fried in stir fries or simply marinated and whacked on the barbecue another great value but delicious cut is the hanger steak known as the butcher's cut because they often keep it for themselves it's great marinated and cooked quickly with the sirloin which is basically the back of the animal a nice sirloin like this really well marbled don't buy too lean so once the sirloin is trimmed up it looks something like this not too much fat but you need a little bit to cook in it next to the sirloin is the rib really popular now with rib eyes small nice really tender juicy steaks it's really especially good for barbecuing or grilling fantastic probably my favorite steak would be a rib eye rib eye is especially delicious because the marbling in the meat loads it with flavor for a full-on steak experience try the t-bone steak with a small tender fillet steak on one side of the bone and a larger flavor some sirloin on the other [Music] take your butcher's advice and you won't go wrong the final word has to go to danny when buying meat knowledge really is power so it's important to ask as many questions about the meat you're buying find out the breeds how it's aged and decide exactly what you want to do each particular job that should then give you a really amazing end product [Music] the great thing about brunch is there are no rules the only thing i insist on are it's got to be fuss-free easy to cook and so delicious it puts you in a good mood for the rest of the day and for me pancakes always hit the spot here are three of my deliciously different recipes certified to liven up your mornings first up fluffy blueberry and ricotta pancakes with yogurt [Music] start by adding 125 grams of plain flour a teaspoon of baking powder a pinch of salt a tablespoon of sugar then create a wet in the center separate two eggs and add the yolks keeping the whites for later beat the yolks into the flour pouring in milk gradually to form a smooth batter [Music] next fold in 125 grams of creamy ricotta cheese and 100 grams of fresh blueberries [Music] now

fresh mango and drizzle over the gorgeous citrusy syrup sweet sticky and utterly irresistible ready in under 20 minutes the ultimate indulgent pancakes fast to prepare easy to make three effortless recipes guaranteed to bring some sparkle to your brunches incredible welcome back to my ultimate cookery course i'm teaching you all about brunches the most laid-back meal of the week and if you want to take it easy having the right equipment makes all the difference [Music] here's my guide to the best kitchen equipment everything you need to know about the basic kit that will get you cooking fantastic food chopping boards for brunch one of the most useful things is a great chopping board get the right one and it'll be your friend for life i prefer a sort of heavy duty one because they're so much more durable they can be flipped over the minute you want to go from vegetables to prepping fish or meat always keep a little jake off underneath that actually stops the board from sliding carefully wooden board by rubbing it with oil every so often any cooking oil will do wooden boards for me are always the best easy to clean and long lasting when you do wash your wooden board never let it stand in water or put it in the dishwasher as it may split buy the best you can afford and take good care of it [Music] for brunch i'd love something sweet and i've always been a fan of classic british crumpets with butter and jam but once you try cooking them at home you'll never want to buy them from shops again this is another great recipe you can stake your life on it's my homemade

as it drips through the whisk now we're looking for it to double in size and get nice and light so pop in a warm place whilst you get on with the delicious topping [Music] beautiful strawberries but caramelized almost like a very quick strawberry jam hang on [Music] just slice these in half some sugar a couple of tablespoons we're gonna take the sugar to a nice light caramel it's just starting to

wrapped in that delicious caramel now finish that with a nice ball of creme fraiche let that sit there and that is an amazing way of finishing off a traditional brunch with something sweet something delicious and something you're dying to tuck into [Music] next my tricks of the trade and kitchen tips fruit can be a great healthy option for brunch and knowing how to get the best out of it can make all the difference first up how to peel and cut a mango the easy way holding your stalk end up cut either side of the stone cut all the way into the flesh making squares without cutting through the skin then turn it inside out and carefully cut your pieces off a great tip to check if a pineapple is ripe is to pull a leaf out from the top if it comes away easily it's ripe and ready for slicing my tip to get the flesh out of a kiwi is to simply cut the fruit in half and scoop it out with a teaspoon try it it really works if you have fruit that's not perfectly ripe the tip is to put a banana in a paper bag then add your unripe fruit put in a dark place and the banana will speed up the ripening process of the other fruit you can make a grapefruit puree to accompany a brunch pancake or a crumpet in a blender to clean it afterwards add a cup of warm water and run the machine for a few seconds empty out then simply repeat with a drop of washing up liquid then rinse [Music] follow my

flake that don't press it too hard otherwise you'll dry out the tuna now these are water chestnuts just slice them nice and thin you can buy them anywhere any supermarket chestnuts in fresh ginger get rid of that rough skin on the outside by grating the ginger you get to get all that really nice sort of juice in take your spring onions and just slice on an angle i like the texture of the water chestnut with a spring onion or touch of fresh coriander lovely next remove the seeds from a chili to reduce its heat without losing any flavor and finely chilis in kaffir lime leaves roll them up nice and tight run your knife down the center once and just chop and that makes the fish cake nice and fragrant touch of salt a touch of pepper fish sauce just lightly season the tuna to bind all those wonderful ingredients two whole eggs and give that a nice little whisk and then add your eggs get your hands in there and start mixing get the mixture roll it hand to hand and the palm pat them down nicely to cook add a little ground oil to a hot pan at the face of a clock i'm going to go from 12 all the way around first one in these fish cakes only take a few minutes to cook so keeping track of the order they go in the pan means you know which one to turn first [Music] give the pad a nice gentle little shake make sure that nothing's sticking to the bottom spatula two fingers on top turn them over beautiful that crackling noise is something you always want because the tune's already cooked so we're just lightly frying them to get a nice crisp outside and gently take them out smell incredible let them sit there i'm gonna make a really nice delicious simple dipping sauce start off a little pinch of sugar fish sauce two tablespoons that gives it the saltiness one tablespoon of rice wine vinegar and some fresh lime juice squeeze all that lime in there your fresh coriander lots of coriander and in give that a little mix and then you have the most amazing spicy tuna fish cakes who would have thought something as delicious as that can come out of a can a simple supper in minutes that's so mouth-wateringly easy and delicious you're guaranteed to cook it again and again when it comes to simple cooking there are two basic bits of kit i'm never without that will save you time and effort in the kitchen a grater and a peeler the swivel peeler a stainless steel one absolutely incredible it's almost like a lifesaver in the kitchen because they are so quick so light swivel blade so we've got so much more flexibility actually go around the vegetable and we call it speed peeler in the professional kitchen because it does literally absolutely rapidly peels your vegetables you have minimal waste good peelers cost them a couple of quid and are great for everything from peeling veg to finely slicing cheese and making shards of chocolate a good comfortable grip and a sharp stainless steel blade ensures you'll always work fast [Music] the box grater is another great versatile kitchen tool and with its planes for course grating fine grating and super fine as well as blades for slicing it's perfect for everything from puring ginger and zesting lemons to shredding onions super small so they can caramelize in a flash and be sure to get a solid handle to hold it firm and it's got such volume inside it doesn't crush everything up so i always prefer to grate onto a tray or into a bowl so you don't have to move it again creating onto the board you've always got to lift it up and place it in so place the grater into a bowl and grate two simple but essential speedy bits of kit guaranteed to make your life in the kitchen easier [Music] bread is a brilliant base for delicious super fast lunches and suppers here are three of my deliciously simple recipes that transform a humble bit of bread into a gastronomic treat first up flatbreads with fennel and feta [Music] add olive oil to a flatbread [Music] then place in a hot frying pan and toast until crisp and golden on both sides these deliciously versatile breads are made without yeast and are available in good supermarkets and local middle eastern shops next thinly slice fresh fennel and scatter over the toasted flatbread then toast aromatic fennel seeds in a hot dry pan and sprinkle on top crumble over wonderfully tangy feta cheese [Music] finish with a drizzle of sweet and sticky pomegranate molasses bread transformed before your eyes flatbreads with fennel and feta simple delicious and ready to eat in minutes [Music] my next recipe that turns a hunk of bread into a stunning dish is bruschetta with garlic tomatoes capers and pecorino [Music] start by slicing a baguette diagonally to get a large surface area so it holds more of the delicious topping drizzle the bread with extra virgin olive oil then place it oil side down onto a scorching hot griddle when the bread is beautifully charred remove and rub with a pill clove of garlic pay attention to the edges next half sweet cherry tomatoes and rub the juices into the toasted garlic bread then simply crush on top [Music] next slice and scatter over tangy caper berries and use a veg peeler to add shavings of salty pecorino cheese [Music] finally drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and add a twist of black pepper fantastic fresh flavors in the flesh of a griddle pan toast has never tasted so good [Music] perfect for a simple light supper or an easy lunch my next dish is the cannellini bean crostini with anchovy and olive oil [Music] first for the topping heat olive oil in a frying pan add tin cannellini beans along with the juices once heated gently mash the beans with a fork then add sliced black olives roughly chop parsley and a splash of sherry vinegar season and leave on a gentle heat next half a festive batter and splash with extra virgin olive oil heat a griddle pan until smoking and toast the bread all side down pressing it into the pan to char evenly to serve top the toasted chipatta with a cannali bean mixture and finish with chopped anchovies packed with bold flavors so easy you can always make it blindfolded ready in under 10 minutes but eaten in seconds three different breads three fantastic recipes proof that even when you're pressed for time you can still eat like a king incredible welcome back to my ultimate cookery course [Music] these are my perfect tv dinners next up my guide to getting the best ingredients for your money my shopping manta is very simple first rely on your senses make sure whatever you're buying it looks smells and really feels good and if you get the chance to taste it before you buy it then do it second is to recognize that knowledge is absolutely crucial the more you know about where your ingredients are from and how they produce the better so don't be scared ask lots of questions and learn and when you want a simple supper herbs are perfect to use in your cooking they add vibrancy an amazing depth of flavor and once you get the hang of them they are so quick and simple to use and one woman who really knows the chef's best friends is expert herb grower lorraine melton i love herbs i love the way you can cook with them i love the smell of them she's been growing an incredible array of herbs in the wet cambridgeshire countryside for over 20 years and can smell a bay from a basil at 50 paces we grow about 150 varieties of herbs it's always interesting to grow new varieties see what they taste like see what they smell like it gets a bit addictive after a while broadly speaking you get harder herbs and softer herbs softer herbs are things like parsley basil rocket coriander we grow um two main types of parsley we've got flat leaf parsley and curly parsley flavour-wise i think they're very similar although a lot of people would say that the flat leaf parsley has got a stronger more aromatic flavour this is your common basil sweet geneves this is a purple variety called ruben we do greek basil thai basil holy basil when you're looking for a basil you want a bright fresh basil nice leaves no blemishes and nice strong stems it's got a lot of oils in it and it's very strong smelling it just tastes a summer basil lorraine certainly knows her stuff and she's right soft herbs are delicate so for maximum flavor always use them at the end of cooking or simply add as they are to cold dishes here are my top five soft herbs that i could never live without [Music] basil as lorraine said it comes in many types all with an amazing sweet punch and flavor great blitzed in pestos sprinkled whole over mozzarella and showing its versatility it even makes a wonderful ice cream parsley beautifully earthy and intensely fresh use both the leaves and the stem for great depth of flavor in savoury dressing soups and salads coriander for an amazing hint of citrus often used in thai dishes coriander is perfect in curries and chutneys but it bruises easily so treat it with care tarragon a staple of french cooking this has long soft green leaves and a distinct anti-seed flavour great with chicken or in rich creamy sauces [Music] finally chervil both mild and sweet a perfect pairing with fish an incredible mix simply with melted butter for a quick source those are my favorite soft herbs what about the hard ones the harder ones tend to be a more woody plant things like thyme rosemary you've got your common time which is your ordinary general bog standard cooking time and then you've got things like lemon thyme we do an orange thyme which is actually one of my favorites it smells like thyme but it's got a deep sort of musky scent as well which is going to give you a slightly different flavor in your dish hard herbs like thyme can take more intense cooking than soft herbs so they're great in stews roast or pan frying choose the right one and you can add wonderful depth of flavor to your dishes here are my top five i use day in and day out rosemary amazingly robust with great bittersweet green leaves it's a classic paired with lamb delicious sprinkled over speciality breads like focaccia or great as toppings for fruity sorbets lorraine's favorite thyme a heady aromatic pungent herb which adds delicious flavor to a sunday roast it's amazing with wild mushrooms and is perfect in marinades oregano warm and full of delicious aromatic oils a staple of great italian dishes and perfect sprinkled on pizzas or in pasta sauces [Music] sage a strong tasting herb with a deliciously bitter flavor incredible in stuffings and with rich meats like pork or duck finally bay bitter sweet and spicy it's delicious simmered in soups stocks and risottos and just as good dried or fresh grown herbs is a lot easier than people think it is on winter boxes in balconies and it's great you can just open your window put your hand out and snip some off when you're out looking for hers make sure they're not nice and healthy no blemishes stems look strong they should just spring back it's a nice springy sort of herbs smell obviously is quite important not all things smell but obviously if you think it's one that's going to smell like lemon thyme you should have a nice fresh lemon scent and obviously the final one is taste you can tip a bit off and taste your herbs and you can see what they taste like them whether bored from a supermarket or pig from your window box herb's a great way to add fresh flavors to your dishes perfect for delicious simple suppers [Music] even if you got a super busy lifestyle it doesn't mean missing out on delicious desserts they just have to be simple to make when it comes to cooking at home puddings should always be a pleasure and never a chore and homemade puds are 100 guaranteed to impress my next recipe has only two main ingredients but simplicity doesn't mean food can't taste out of this world incredible griddle pineapple with spiced caramel if you're making a dessert for one or two it's gonna be quick and easy this sumptuous delicious griddle pineapple fits the bill perfectly pineapple a way of testing it's nice and ripe top of the leaves come out perfect ready to go always cut a pineapple with a serrated edge knife slice off the bottom turn it back over and slice the top part now keep that for later look at the core the center of the pineapple and slice down directly in half slice that in half take each quarter and slice them smells incredible lay down flat and just slice that core off so you've got this perfect sort of boat of pineapple slice underneath but stop as you get right at the end slicing around the skin will make the pineapple easier to eat but leaving it attached gives you more control as it cooks next heat a griddle pan as hot as you can start off in the corner and push it down so you really mark the pineapple two minutes on each side and then just turn them really nice color man look at that beautiful i'm gonna sprinkle them with a little touch of sugar that's gonna glaze them now slice the top take out these beautiful glazed slices of pineapple there next up the spiced caramel now start off with your pan nice and hot sprinkle four tablespoons of sugar in there just flatten it then add the seeds from a fresh vanilla pod in a small dusting of chinese fly spice never stir caramel let it sort of bubble and transform here she goes now i've got the color i want it that's the perfect color off with the gas in with the butter and then a couple of tablespoons of cream lovely and then give that a little whisk add the rest of your cream nice and just drip that spicy caramel over your pineapple [Music] wow simple elegant and seriously impressive griddle pineapple with spiced caramel a delicious treat all to yourself that tastes even better shared [Music] next my tricks of the trade and kitchen tips first up the proper way to chop fresh herbs to get maximum flavor chopping herbs the secret is to chop them not bruise them now basil this is a soft herb so treat it with some respect when people go mad chopping herbs all the goodness comes out on the board i want the goodness left inside the basil place them all inside one another with the largest leaf at the bottom and it's almost like rolling a cigar large one at the bottom small ones in the center and then look place them down together just roll them nice and gently don't bruise them step one rolled ready to slice sharp knife imperative fingers tucked in the bottom part of your knuckle is the guide between you and the herbs that there stops you from cutting your finger really important to get comfortable with a knife and just practice rolling the knife across the board and relaxing that wrist it's all in the wrist action so herbs up fingernails tucked underneath and just up and down up and down and there you have a chopped basil that's not bruised and smelling very fragra right coriander so you get the bunch of coriander hold it down and just lightly shave the leaves off the stalks bunch them up together and then just again let the knife do the work take the fingernails in and just chop once and once early don't hack it just chop it you can always identify when you've bruised the herb when you've removed the herbs off the board there's a big green patch mmm full of flavour and none of the goodness is left on the chopping board a great tip for using leftover herbs simply chop finely mix into butter roll up in clim film and freeze then when you want a herby hit cut into slices and melt over steaks chicken or veg asparagus is great for a simple supper to prepare always remove the lower woody stem by gently bending and the asparagus will snap at the perfect point then boil or steam and serve with a little of my herb butter for a cracking soft boiled egg simply place your egg in boiling water add a splash of vinegar and cook for exactly eight minutes then plunge into ice water the vinegar helps the shell peel off easily and the ice water stops the egg from cooking giving you the perfect runny yolk [Music] for fuss-free salad dressings simply add the ingredients into a jam jar screw the lid on tightly and shake to combine in seconds there's no need to wash up a whisk and the jar is ready made to

the more flavoursome it becomes marinating the lamb first chillies we're going to use a mixture of red and green take off the tops and just slice in garlic crushed don't worry about chopping these ultra fine just get it in there cooking for up to three hours everything sort of blends and almost sort of purees itself together smoked paprika goes brilliantly well with the chilis two teaspoons in a touch of dried oregano some little cumin seeds the blend and the fragrance that they give out is extraordinary they release a little oil as well and helps to tenderize the lamb a touch of salt pepper cinnamon that sort of sweetens up the lamb olive oil just a tablespoon and the olive oil helps to sort of stick all those wonderful spices to the lamb jump in just start really rubbing at this stage you can leave the lamb to marinade for anything from half an hour to overnight allowing the spices to really penetrate the meat giving amazing results when you tuck in delicious vegetables carrots and onions and that's it sliced secret slicing vegetables from braising is not getting too thin you slice the onions too thin they burn you've got that horrible char taste on that slow braised braising it's just a chef's term that means cooking in liquid on a low heat making the meat incredibly moist and beautifully tender so the secret of braising is having a really nice thick durable pan get that nice and hot just a touch of olive oil lamb in hold the bone because you're in control then into the pan i want that white fat to start rendering so it'll add more fat therefore making it a lot more flavoursome as it braises chili's cinnamon in mix that up and don't be scared you're not burning this you're sort of searing the lamb shanks and this is the important part right at the very beginning we're getting the colour on the lamb which washes off as it braises in the oven so be generous with that color vegetables in wow and then a couple of baileys so now you lift the lamb up and get the lamb sat on top of the vegetables now just glaze the pan with red wine the glazing means that you're you're cleaning the bottom of the pan and you're getting that amazing flavor washed off and lifted up into that sauce can really transform that dish always delays then bring to the boil and cook for about 10 minutes to reduce the wines reduce down by half now for the stock bring that stock back up to the ball and then into the oven now don't cover it when you cover it all the condensation comes off the lid your lamb becomes gray all this effort and that exciting spice gets washed away no lid and in the oven for three hours a slow cook on a low heat of 160 degrees gives the spices time to work and transform the meat so it's mouthwateringly tender now look at those out on to a plate you can just see that meat sliding down juicy and incredibly tender grab it by the the shank roll around that rich delicious sauce look at and get that sauce nice beautiful just get some mint don't chop it just pick that fresh mint and let it snow and there you go a very spicy delicious melting of the mouth lamb shank amazing red mullet with sweet chilli sauce cooking is about being adventurous and having the confidence to go off piste and being a little bit more daring so when you start combining peanuts chili flakes and this amazing fish red mullet trust me you're in for an amazing treat we're gonna make a really nice light sweet chilli sauce first off your chili off with the top in half and those seeds inside are very powerful incredibly hot but full of flavor garlic two cloves of garlic slice the garlic nice and thin so it helps to puree the chilies in the pest and water garlic in such a salt a little touch of sugar in and then start grinding push down first [Music] the salt and the sugar really helps to puree the chili and the garlic fish sauce always a base to a chili sauce two tablespoons in and a touch of rice wine vinegar fish sauce gives it the saltiness the vinegar gives it a nice acidic wake up three tablespoons of olive oil nice mix that up beautiful look at the colors incredible now spring onions i want the texture and the crunch spring onions in the coriander slice it once in fresh lime and that goes brilliantly with the red mullet just really wakes up the chili the garlic and reminds the sauce that we're serving with fish now taste wow that's delicious look at that beautiful the longer that chili sauce sits there the better it gets now for the peanuts and chili that's gonna coat the top of the red mullet peanuts in salt in that helps to really grind the peanuts down some beautiful dried chili flakes creates a nice sort of warm heat i'm using fresh chili for the sauce but dried chili flakes for the coating which will really crunch up when cooking just a little bit of coriander mix the coriander in to the peanuts and look i like them quite textured i don't want them too small as a powder otherwise they'll burn but crushed lightly to coat the fish with the chili and peanut seasoning in a separate bowl beat two eggs along with a splash of fish sauce take your fillet lay in your red mullet dip it in shake up your peanuts and then in and make sure you push that down cover that red mullet up beautiful now make sure that pan is really nice and piping hot if you put the fish in and the pan's cold all those wonderful peanuts and chilli just gonna slide off the fish so we need to sear it in and get it nice and crisp in and lay away from you beautiful [Music] if the pan starts getting a little bit too hot get your olive oil and just place another teaspoon of olive oil around the outside so it starts to heat up as it hits the center and it really helps to stay so much more in control and turn nice and gently we want that nice sort of toasted sauteed crispness which adds a really lovely flavor tilt the pan and just baste the top of the red mullet with that really nice piping hot olive oil you've got that really nice roasted crunch and it goes brilliantly with that soft sweetness of that fish inside get off and just leave them sitting in there and finish with lime and just go over each one now we'll take them out and the sauce will touch on the bottom and the tail of each fish now to round that off serving some fragrant rice sauteed broccoli amazing and there you have a delicious peanut and crusted red mullet with a wonderful sweet chilli sauce cooking with chilis isn't all about blow your head off heat this dish uses the exciting taste of a chili but has a deliciously elegant and subtle flavor spicy beef salad chillies if you use them confidently they can really add a new dimension to the style of cooking but the real trick is finding that balance of flavors that really suits you because that's the most important part so this is the most amazing sirloin you can see it's got that wonderful marble for me the secret behind this is cooking it quickly season the steaks generously salt and pepper push that seasoning in to the sirloin take the soda out the fridge literally 20 minutes before you want to cook them so it gets up to room temperature they cook more evenly but more importantly you can actually season right inside the steak this little bit of fat down here season that as well because that is what we want to roast and get that really nice and rendered olive oil in a tablespoon roll that round as it starts to smoke in with the steaks into the pan and lay away again into the pan and lay away if you don't hear that noise the minute those steaks hit the pan don't put them in so the secret now is getting that color on the steak turning it once and once only and cooking it for two and a half minutes each side what i want to do is to get that bit of fat rendered so it adds a lot more flavor just hold the steak down like that and that starts to melt the fat which makes it so much more tender there should be no white fat left anywhere turn them over really important to have that steak up to room temperature before you start cooking it so the inside is nice and warm so we spend less time in the pan and more time cooling down really important now two fingers touch it goes in says rare i'm happy for them to be rare because by the time i let them rest they're gonna go back to medium rare it'll continue cooking out onto a plate and let them rest one two let's get my juices over don't waste that really important next the spicy dressing take the seeds out of the chili to reduce the heat by rubbing it in your hands and tapping until the seeds fall out cut it in half and just chop it in garlic and chilli works brilliantly a quick way of peeling it get your knife and just slam it down pops out very very quickly in a little touch of salt rub start going around in circles first you'll see it pureeing nice clear that off now we've got the heat in there from the chilli and that richness from the garlic two teaspoons of palm sugar this is where it starts to have that nice sweet sour effect fish sauce fresh lime this is a simple fresh chili dressing and it was something i fell in love with in vietnam and cambodia because it was just so easy give that a little mix and dissolve the sugar quick taste wow right vegetables a great fuss-free way to get super thin ribbons of carrot is to use a veg peeler when they're that thin they take the vinaigrette so much better and radishes just slice them down at an angle lovely to give another dimension to the salad i'm gonna use a banana shallot they are incredibly mellow very sweet across just chop up the shallot and mix that through want some sweetness in there now little vine tomatoes slice them in half tomatoes in shallot radish carrots and tomatoes next peel and slice cucumber chopped spring onions and shred baby gem lettuce and then finally get some fresh mint there's young men so you don't need to take all those stalks off all you do is hold the bunch upside down and then take it for a little trim and just chop that once through look at that nice minted salad a couple of tablespoons of dressing don't flood the cellar with the dressing we can always add but we can't take it away now really mix that dressing in there make sure all that chili and garlic and palm sugar wraps around that salad beautiful onto the plate the steak's rested it's now nice and medium rare that little bit of fat we don't want to find that in the salad just slice that off that serves its purpose it's kept that steak nice and moist just slice going with the grain it's almost like slicing through butter and look inside beautiful pink you slice the beef too thinly then it goes stone cold and more importantly all the goodness runs out of it nice thick slices get the beef and start placing it around the salad take a little teaspoon of your dressing the rest of your salad sip that on top we'll finish it off with some toasted peanuts peanuts in now those nuts are really toasted nuts on get another pan and just crush once they've cooled down just run them through with a knife they can hear how crunchy they are another texture another taste the salad and then from there sprinkle and then finally take that just finish it with a little tablespoon of that sauce and there is one tasty very well textured spicy beef salad [Music]

outstanding brunches i love brunch it's a great way of relaxing with friends and family not taking yourself or anything else too seriously and brunch dishes should reflect that spicy sweet or savoury anything goes and one of my all-time favorites a dish that always creates a stir is the daddy of all brunches steak sandwiches [Music] for me the secret of a great brunch is fun and casual fuss-free cooking and everyone helping themselves this is the ultimate steak sandwich you want the rolls royce of beef it has to be fill it now season it beautifully i like to open up the top of the peppermill to increase the size of the pepper in the steak so it gives that bit of heat nice little chunks you just roll now nicely all the way around now slice the garlic in half pan nice and hot olive oil in [Music] hold the steak and just place it into the pan don't drop it at the front of the pan we're going to tilt the pan forward to cook the back of the steak dual purpose now roll it back and sear underneath next my garlic and roast that garlic time fry that time i want to hear it we're not looking for a lot of color because you're going to dry out the fill it so just one end turn it back down and stir the other end in lift up your time place it on top of the garlic there lift up your fillet and sit there on top of your garlic butter in take a spoon tilt the pan gently lift up and baste i've got that scented garlic thyme flavor the steak is going to cook evenly because it's sat on a little a little bed in the oven for 8 to 10 minutes [Music] pan on for the relish you think of a steak sandwich you think of a sort of nice heated tomato relish to make the relish finely dice a red onion three finger rule one in front two behind through and chop wow next roughly chop a chili keeping the seeds in for extra heat start off with the olive oil into a pan onions chili generous with the olive oil i want a nice sort of rich silky relish from there take your tomatoes you can't just use red tomatoes but these yellow and red make the perfect combination now put your salt in pepper and then roast those tomatoes off take a wooden spoon and just sort of break them up once the skins blister the whole tomato just starts to release all that really nice sweet texture a little teaspoon of cherry vinegar gives that nice acidic balance the sweetness of the tomatoes turn down the gas and just let them sort of stew perfectly now a steak sandwich would not be complete unless it had the most amazing mustard mayonnaise simply add three tablespoons of mayonnaise to three teaspoons of whole grain mustard [Music] now i've got the reddish almost down to like a really nice jam now i want to make that relish a little bit more fragrant some basil slice it through sprinkle that basil in there [Music] beautiful look at this there she is my crown jewels time to take it out smell is incredible just based one more time to fill it touch is quite soft in the center so it's just coming up to mid-rare let it rest at the same time you cooked it it'll be nice and pink evenly throughout the steak to make my sandwich i'm going to char grill some sliced chipatta bread season it nicely just a little drizzle of olive oil i want to get that bread nice and crispy pan nice and hot bread in push it down smell is amazing that char sort of charcoal flavor once you've got those marks on the bread it just stops the bread from becoming soggy and look at this here it is stunning on slice it gently one beautiful slice wow it's nice and pink all the way through and the beef is so soft it's almost like slicing through butter let the knife do the work take a little bit of mayonnaise spread that the back of the spoon on both sides next lettuce take that beautiful slice of beef and then relish on top of that beef and just slice the sandwich in half beautiful now that's what i call a steak sandwich trust me sir the sublime sandwich for brunch and you'll put a smile on everyone's face [Music] next up my guide to buying the best beef and steaks if you want the ultimate brunch you can't do any better than start with a perfect steak and one man who really knows his steak is master butcher danny lidgate steak is my favorite type of meat and i think it's really good to enjoy different varieties of steak when choosing a steak that you want you need to look at exactly what you want out of it for my ultimate steak sandwich i used to fill it because it's the most tender the fillet does the least amount of work than all the other mussels it's tucked away in the rib cage this means that when you find a fillet it's incredibly soft like butter it's the most expensive but you get what you pay for there's a wide array of cuts to choose from all different in taste and texture if in doubt ask your butcher this would be the rump section where the rump comes from which is basically the back side take the bone out and what you're left with is a wonderful steak rum steak characteristically a little bit tougher than the sirloin or a little bit chewier than the ribeye but a really strong flavor for the steak again when frying rum look for the marbling try and get some fat covering on the steak you can always cut it off after it's cooked rumps one of the best value steaks i love it thinly cut them flesh fried in stir fries or simply marinated and whacked on the barbecue another great value but delicious cut is the hanger steak known as the butcher's cut because they often keep it for themselves it's great marinated and cooked quickly with the sirloin which is basically the back of the animal a nice sirloin like this really well marbled don't buy too lean so once the sirloin is trimmed up it looks something like this not too much fat but you need a little bit to cook in it next to the sirloin is the rib really popular now with rib eyes small nice really tender juicy steaks it's really especially good for barbecuing or grilling fantastic probably my favorite steak would be a rib eye rib eye is especially delicious because the marbling in the meat loads it with flavor for a full-on steak experience try the t-bone steak with a small tender fillet steak on one side of the bone and a larger flavor some sirloin on the other [Music] take your butcher's advice and you won't go wrong the final word has to go to danny when buying meat knowledge really is power so it's important to ask as many questions about the meat you're buying find out the breeds how it's aged and decide exactly what you want to do each particular job that should then give you a really amazing end product [Music] the great thing about brunch is there are no rules the only thing i insist on are it's got to be fuss-free easy to cook and so delicious it puts you in a good mood for the rest of the day and for me pancakes always hit the spot here are three of my deliciously different recipes certified to liven up your mornings first up fluffy blueberry and ricotta pancakes with yogurt

fantastic food chopping boards for brunch one of the most useful things is a great chopping board get the right one and it'll be your friend for life i prefer a sort of heavy duty one because they're so much more durable they can be flipped over the minute you want to go from vegetables to prepping fish or meat always keep a little jake off underneath that actually stops the board from sliding carefully wooden board by rubbing it with oil every so often any cooking oil will do wooden boards for me are always the best easy to clean and long lasting when you do wash your wooden board never let it stand in water or put it in the dishwasher as it may split buy the best you can afford and take good care of it [Music] for brunch i'd love something sweet and i've always been a fan of classic british crumpets with butter and jam but once you try cooking them at home you'll never want to buy them from shops again this is another great recipe you can stake your life on it's my homemade crumpet whether you're cooking for two three or even a gang some of the best brunch dishes are always the simplest these crumpets are absolutely delicious and it's a great end to a fantastic brunch first off we're gonna make the mix when you think of growing up the smell and the taste of amazing crumpet it never leaves you to make the mix the secret is to bring the milk up the ball but do not boil it the minute it boils turn it off and let it sit there now flour in a nice pinch of salt in now add half a teaspoon of bicarb that gives it aeration and really lifts the mixture up all those lovely little holes a nice pinch of sugar and then a teaspoon of yeast dry yeast now once the milk's boiled turn it off and add some warm water about 10 tablespoons 150 mil that cools down the milk but more importantly it doesn't destroy the yeast half of the milk in first stop and give that a really good mix now the rest of it [Music] [Music] you can just see that there's no lumps through there as it drips through the whisk now we're looking for it to double in size and get nice and light so pop in a warm place whilst you get on with the delicious topping [Music] beautiful strawberries but caramelized almost like a very quick strawberry jam hang on [Music] just slice these in half some sugar a couple of tablespoons we're gonna take the sugar to a nice light caramel it's just starting to change color now turn the gas down and we're gonna add the strawberries beautiful just sweating the strawberries down quickly and the caramels breaking down a wonderful glaze on the strawberries some lemon grated into the strawberries gives it that kind of freshness that really starts to break down the strawberries nice gas up smells incredible some lemon juice touch of balsamo vinegar and that gives it that really nice delicious tartness now off it goes as the strawberries start to cool down it will naturally thicken and set beautifully nice [Music] now for the crumpet it's almost doubled in size but be very careful you don't knock the bowl because it can sort of push out all that air it's aerated it's nice as light just see the texture she's ready to go to boil it here we go instead of making normal small crumpets i'm making a giant one ideal for sharing now turn the gas down you just start to see a traditional crumpet style cooking process we want those nice tiny little holes on top and that crispy crunchy base right now it's time to add the butter and just slide the butter down the bag that gives it a really nice nutty flavor at the end fish nice flip beautiful take that out take the jam spoon over the secret is for the juice to sort of run inside all those little holes think of that tartness of the balsamic vinegar the strawberries beautifully soft and almost pureed wrapped in that delicious caramel now finish that with a nice ball of creme fraiche let that sit there and that is an amazing way of finishing off a traditional brunch with something sweet something delicious and something you're dying to tuck into [Music] next my tricks of the trade and kitchen tips fruit can be a great healthy option for brunch and knowing how to get the best out of it can make all the difference first up how to peel and cut a mango the easy way holding your stalk end up cut either side of the stone cut all the way into the flesh making squares without cutting through the skin then turn it inside out and carefully cut your pieces off a great tip to check if a pineapple is ripe is to pull a leaf out from the top if it comes away easily it's ripe and ready for slicing my tip to get the flesh out of a kiwi is to simply cut the fruit in half and scoop it out with a teaspoon try it it really works if you have fruit that's not perfectly ripe the tip is to put a banana in a paper bag then add your unripe fruit put in a dark place and the banana will speed up the ripening process of the other fruit you can make a grapefruit puree to accompany a brunch pancake or a crumpet in a blender to clean it afterwards add a cup of warm water and run the machine for a few seconds empty out then simply repeat with a drop of washing up liquid then rinse [Music] follow my

suppers one of my essential mantras for becoming a better cook is it's all about building your confidence and the way to do that is with practice the key is to have a repertoire of easy dishes you want to cook and eat time and time again and soon you'll be on your way to becoming a kitchen demon my first dish keeps it simple but delivers big time on flavour so it's sure to become a regular quick supper fix spicy tuna fish cakes i love this recipe why because it turns this humble ingredient a can of tuna into something delicious just open up and drain the tuna into a sieve just lightly flake that don't press it too hard otherwise you'll dry out the tuna now these are water chestnuts just slice them nice and thin you can buy them anywhere any supermarket chestnuts in fresh ginger get rid of that rough skin on the outside by grating the ginger you get to get all that really nice sort of juice in take your spring onions and just slice on an angle i like the texture of the water chestnut with a spring onion or touch of fresh coriander lovely next remove the seeds from a chili to reduce its heat without losing any flavor and finely chilis in kaffir lime leaves roll them up nice and tight run your knife down the center once and just chop and that makes the fish cake nice and fragrant touch of salt a touch of pepper fish sauce just lightly season the tuna to bind all those wonderful ingredients two whole eggs and give that a nice little whisk and then add your eggs get your hands in there and start mixing get the mixture roll it hand to hand and the palm pat them down nicely to cook add a little ground oil to a hot pan at the face of a clock i'm going to go from 12 all the way around first one in these fish cakes only take a few minutes to cook so keeping track of the order they go in the pan means you know which one to turn first [Music] give the pad a nice gentle little shake make sure that nothing's sticking to the bottom spatula two fingers on top turn them over beautiful that crackling noise is something you always want because the tune's already cooked so we're just lightly frying them to get a nice crisp outside and gently take them out smell incredible let them sit there i'm gonna make a really nice delicious simple dipping sauce start off a little pinch of sugar fish sauce two tablespoons that gives it the saltiness one tablespoon of rice wine vinegar and some fresh lime juice squeeze all that lime in there your fresh coriander lots of coriander and in give that a little mix and then you have the most amazing spicy tuna fish cakes who would have thought something as delicious as that can come out of a can a simple supper in minutes that's so mouth-wateringly easy and delicious you're guaranteed to cook it again and again when it comes to simple cooking there are two basic bits of kit i'm never without that will save you time and effort in the kitchen a grater and a peeler the swivel peeler a stainless steel one absolutely incredible it's almost like a lifesaver in the kitchen because they are so quick so light swivel blade so we've got so much more flexibility actually go around the vegetable and we call it speed peeler in the professional kitchen because it does literally absolutely rapidly peels your vegetables you have minimal waste good peelers cost them a couple of quid and are great for everything from peeling veg to finely slicing cheese and making shards of chocolate a good comfortable grip and a sharp stainless steel blade ensures you'll always work fast [Music] the box grater is another great versatile kitchen tool and with its planes for course grating fine grating and super fine as well as blades for slicing it's perfect for everything from puring ginger and zesting lemons to shredding onions super small so they can caramelize in a flash and be sure to get a solid handle to hold it firm and it's got such volume inside it doesn't crush everything up so i always prefer to grate onto a tray or into a bowl so you don't have to move it again creating onto the board you've always got to lift it up and place it in so place the grater into a bowl and grate two simple but essential speedy bits of kit guaranteed to make your life in the kitchen easier [Music] bread is a brilliant base for delicious super fast lunches and suppers here are three of my deliciously simple recipes that transform a humble bit of bread into a gastronomic treat first up flatbreads with fennel and feta [Music] add olive oil to a flatbread [Music] then place in a hot frying pan and toast until crisp and golden on both sides these deliciously versatile breads are made without yeast and are available in good supermarkets and local middle eastern shops next thinly slice fresh fennel and scatter over the toasted flatbread then toast aromatic fennel seeds in a hot dry pan and sprinkle on top crumble over wonderfully tangy feta cheese [Music] finish with a drizzle of sweet and sticky pomegranate molasses bread transformed before your eyes flatbreads with fennel and feta simple delicious and ready to eat in minutes [Music] my next recipe that turns a hunk of bread into a stunning dish is bruschetta with garlic tomatoes capers and pecorino [Music] start by slicing a baguette diagonally to get a large surface area so it holds more of the delicious topping drizzle the bread with extra virgin olive oil then place it oil side down onto a scorching hot griddle when the bread is beautifully charred remove and rub with a pill clove of garlic pay attention to the edges next half sweet cherry tomatoes and rub the juices into the toasted garlic bread then simply crush on top [Music] next slice and scatter over tangy caper berries and use a veg peeler to add shavings of salty pecorino cheese [Music] finally drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and add a twist of black pepper fantastic fresh flavors in the flesh of a griddle pan toast has never tasted so good [Music] perfect for a simple light supper or an easy lunch my next dish is the cannellini bean crostini with anchovy and olive oil [Music] first for the topping heat olive oil in a frying pan add tin cannellini beans along with the juices once heated gently mash the beans with a fork then add sliced black olives roughly chop parsley and a splash of sherry vinegar season and leave on a gentle heat next half a festive batter and splash with extra virgin olive oil heat a griddle pan until smoking and toast the bread all side down pressing it into the pan to char evenly to serve top the toasted chipatta with a cannali bean mixture and finish with chopped anchovies packed with bold flavors so easy you can always make it blindfolded ready in under 10 minutes but eaten in seconds three different breads three fantastic recipes proof that even when you're pressed for time you can still eat like a king incredible welcome back to my ultimate cookery course [Music] these are my perfect tv dinners next up my guide to getting the best ingredients for your money my shopping manta is very simple first rely on your senses make sure whatever you're buying it looks smells and really feels good and if you get the chance to taste it before you buy it then do it second is to recognize that knowledge is absolutely crucial the more you know about where your ingredients are from and how they produce the better so don't be scared ask lots of questions and learn and when you want a simple supper herbs are perfect to use in your cooking they add vibrancy an amazing depth of flavor and once you get the hang of them they are so quick and simple to use and one woman who really knows the chef's best friends is expert herb grower lorraine melton i love herbs i love the way you can cook with them i love the smell of them she's been growing an incredible array of herbs in the wet cambridgeshire countryside for over 20 years and can smell a bay from a basil at 50 paces we grow about 150 varieties of herbs it's always interesting to grow new varieties see what they taste like see what they smell like it gets a bit addictive after a while broadly speaking you get harder herbs and softer herbs softer herbs are things like parsley basil rocket coriander we grow um two main types of parsley we've got flat leaf parsley and curly parsley flavour-wise i think they're very similar although a lot of people would say that the flat leaf parsley has got a stronger more aromatic flavour this is your common basil sweet geneves this is a purple variety called ruben we do greek basil thai basil holy basil when you're looking for a basil you want a bright fresh basil nice leaves no blemishes and nice strong stems it's got a lot of oils in it and it's very strong smelling it just tastes a summer basil lorraine certainly knows her stuff and she's right soft herbs are delicate so for maximum flavor always use them at the end of cooking or simply add as they are to cold dishes here are my top five soft herbs that i could never live without [Music] basil as lorraine said it comes in many types all with an amazing sweet punch and flavor great blitzed in pestos sprinkled whole over mozzarella and showing its versatility it even makes a wonderful ice cream parsley beautifully earthy and intensely fresh use both the leaves and the stem for great depth of flavor in savoury dressing soups and salads coriander for an amazing hint of citrus often used in thai dishes coriander is perfect in curries and chutneys but it bruises easily so treat it with care tarragon a staple of french cooking this has long soft green leaves and a distinct anti-seed flavour great with chicken or in rich creamy sauces [Music] finally chervil both mild and sweet a perfect pairing with fish an incredible mix simply with melted butter for a quick source those are my favorite soft herbs what about the hard ones the harder ones tend to be a more woody plant things like thyme rosemary you've got your common time which is your ordinary general bog standard cooking time and then you've got things like lemon thyme we do an orange thyme which is actually one of my favorites it smells like thyme but it's got a deep sort of musky scent as well which is going to give you a slightly different flavor in your dish hard herbs like thyme can take more intense cooking than soft herbs so they're great in stews roast or pan frying choose the right one and you can add wonderful depth of flavor to your dishes here are my top five i use day in and day out rosemary amazingly robust with great bittersweet green leaves it's a classic paired with lamb delicious sprinkled over speciality breads like focaccia or great as toppings for fruity sorbets lorraine's favorite thyme a heady aromatic pungent herb which adds delicious flavor to a sunday roast it's amazing with wild mushrooms and is perfect in marinades oregano warm and full of delicious aromatic oils a staple of great italian dishes and perfect sprinkled on pizzas or in pasta sauces [Music] sage a strong tasting herb with a deliciously bitter flavor incredible in stuffings and with rich meats like pork or duck finally bay bitter sweet and spicy it's delicious simmered in soups stocks and risottos and just as good dried or fresh grown herbs is a lot easier than people think it is on winter boxes in balconies and it's great you can just open your window put your hand out and snip some off when you're out looking for hers make sure they're not nice and healthy no blemishes stems look strong they should just spring back it's a nice springy sort of herbs smell obviously is quite important not all things smell but obviously if you think it's one that's going to smell like lemon thyme you should have a nice fresh lemon scent and obviously the final one is taste you can tip a bit off and taste your herbs and you can see what they taste like them whether bored from a supermarket or pig from your window box herb's a great way to add fresh flavors to your dishes perfect for delicious simple suppers [Music] even if you got a super busy lifestyle it doesn't mean missing out on delicious desserts they just have to be simple to make when it comes to cooking at home puddings should always be a pleasure and never a chore and homemade puds are 100 guaranteed to impress my next recipe has only two main ingredients but simplicity doesn't mean food can't taste out of this world incredible griddle pineapple with spiced caramel if you're making a dessert for one or two it's gonna be quick and easy this sumptuous delicious griddle pineapple fits the bill perfectly pineapple a way of testing it's nice and ripe top of the leaves come out perfect ready to go always cut a pineapple with a serrated edge knife slice off the bottom turn it back over and slice the top part now keep that for later look at the core the center of the pineapple and slice down directly in half slice that in half take each quarter and slice them smells incredible lay down flat and just slice that core off so you've got this perfect sort of boat of pineapple slice underneath but stop as you get right at the end slicing around the skin will make the pineapple easier to eat but leaving it attached gives you more control as it cooks next heat a griddle pan as hot as you can start off in the corner and push it down so you really mark the pineapple two minutes on each side and then just turn them really nice color man look at that beautiful i'm gonna sprinkle them with a little touch of sugar that's gonna glaze them now slice the top take out these beautiful glazed slices of pineapple there next up the spiced caramel now start off with your pan nice and hot sprinkle four tablespoons of sugar in there just flatten it then add the seeds from a fresh vanilla pod in a small dusting of chinese fly spice never stir caramel let it sort of bubble and transform here she goes now i've got the color i want it that's the perfect color off with the gas in with the butter and then a couple of tablespoons of cream lovely and then give that a little whisk add the rest of your cream nice and just drip that spicy caramel over your pineapple [Music] wow simple elegant and seriously impressive griddle pineapple with spiced caramel a delicious treat all to yourself that tastes even better shared [Music] next my tricks of the trade and kitchen tips first up the proper way to chop fresh herbs to get maximum flavor chopping herbs the secret is to chop them not bruise them now basil this is a soft herb so treat it with some respect when people go mad chopping herbs all the goodness comes out on the board i want the goodness left inside the basil place them all inside one another with the largest leaf at the bottom and it's almost like rolling a cigar large one at the bottom small ones in the center and then look place them down together just roll them nice and gently don't bruise them step one rolled ready to slice sharp knife imperative fingers tucked in the bottom part of your knuckle is the guide between you and the herbs that there stops you from cutting your finger really important to get comfortable with a knife and just practice rolling the knife across the board and relaxing that wrist it's all in the wrist action so herbs up fingernails tucked underneath and just up and down up and down and there you have a chopped basil that's not bruised and smelling very fragra right coriander so you get the bunch of coriander hold it down and just lightly shave the leaves off the stalks bunch them up together and then just again let the knife do the work take the fingernails in and just chop once and once early don't hack it just chop it you can always identify when you've bruised the herb when you've removed the herbs off the board there's a big green patch mmm full of flavour and none of the goodness is left on the chopping board a great tip for using leftover herbs simply chop finely mix into butter roll up in clim film and freeze then when you want a herby hit cut into slices and melt over steaks chicken or veg asparagus is great for a simple supper to prepare always remove the lower woody stem by gently bending and the asparagus will snap at the perfect point then boil or steam and serve with a little of my herb butter for a cracking soft boiled egg simply place your egg in boiling water add a splash of vinegar and cook for exactly eight minutes then plunge into ice water the vinegar helps the shell peel off easily and the ice water stops the egg from cooking giving you the perfect runny yolk [Music] for fuss-free salad dressings simply add the ingredients into a jam jar screw the lid on tightly and shake to combine in seconds there's no need to wash up a whisk and the jar is ready made to store any leftovers follow my ultimate cookery course bursting with valuable lessons top tips and 100 recipes to stake your life on and you'll literally be cooking yourself into a better chef many of

Pre-order your copy of Ramsay in 10 here - https://linktr.e...",2022-12-01 22:16:02.926159, salt crusted sea bream served with braised leeks and hazelnuts first job is that salt crust this dish looks intimidating but it is actually very straightforward and very easy make sure the guts are out and the fish is clean the most important thing is always leaving the skin and the scales on that skin protects the actual flesh from becoming salty give the fish a really nice seasoning inside even though we're putting a salt crust on the outside it's still very important to season the middle fennel seeds goes brilliantly well with fish and then slice the lemon nice large thick slices the zest and the lemon bakes inside the fish fold over the fish and just squeeze the juice now for the salt about 150 mil to 200 ml of water what you're trying to do now is just bring the salt together and you want to sort of end up with a bowl of salt that looks almost like snow you'll need about two kilos of salt for this and it doesn't need to be the fancy stuff even though you're using a lot of it it won't make the fish salty instead the crust forms a kiln that retains moisture now basically a nice bed of salt underneath flatten it down lay the fish on top of the salt get your salt and just start packing you can salt crust almost any fish from sea bass to salmon or flat fish like seoul but it's not great with oily fish now it looks like a ridiculous amount of salt but it's really important to cover all the fish because you want that nice shell and the minute salt hits the oven it sort of tightens up and forms this large crust that goes in at 180 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes whilst the fish cooks is onto my beautiful braised leeks splash of olive oil leek is a very sort of firm robust vegetable so it can take a really nice sear the most exciting thing about these leagues are they go gooseweek with the sea breeze but braised leeks colored properly with a lot of flavor on there tastes absolutely delicious take a couple of cloves of garlic and just crush them in with the leeks some fresh thyme get some butter in there raising them in butter and white wine gives them the most amazing flavor braising is a chefy term for searing at a high temperature then cooking with a bit of liquid bring that up to the boil and then the rest of your butter now as the white wine reduces down the flavor of the leeks intensifying they glaze turn it down just leave that little gap there if we totally covered it then you're gonna get all that condensation from beneath the lid and it'll just make the leeks watery the leeks will take about 12 minutes to cook so now for the garnish roasted hazelnuts they'll be roasted in the oven very brittle very firm so get them inside pestle and water a bit of seasoning and just crush your nuts don't over pound them i just want this nice sort of rustic chopped toasted hazelnuts now get your knife you want that going through with ease and turn off the gas right absolutely adore them like stunning little parcels soft and slightly creamy now baste the leeks with the remaining butter spread your flat leaf parsley over generously and then just sprinkle the toasted hazelnuts the combination of that earthiness from the leeks the roasted flavour from the hazelnuts that is a stunning way of eating leeks and now for the fish and look now just gently tap the top and it starts falling away you can just see that beautiful shine carefully lift off your salt now peel that skin look how juicy and succulent that sea beam is stays incredibly moist the other great thing about cooking whole fish like this it makes it so easy to fill it take your spoon run that down through the top and the fish will just slide off there now just push back that lovely it and look that is cooked beautifully that's what keeps them coming back for more and more and more when you have friends over you want to keep lunch relaxed laid back but impressive and a salt crust bring with beautiful braised leeks is just that all over southeast asia you find people cooking and eating the huge bowls of delicious noodle soups it's a very simple dish but the variations you get are extraordinary different meats different fish and even different dumplings but what i love most about noodle soup is the fact is the complete meal carbs protein and vegetables in one big bowl of happiness for my ultimate southeast asian lunch i'm showing you one of my favorites spicy clam and noodle soup followed by sweet morish banana and coconut fritters for dessert first up my dessert banana fritters take your bananas and to get them really nice and soft just rub the banana sip together flour and baking powder sugar into the flour then add coconut for texture and a pinch of salt sounds strange in the dessert but it works brilliantly especially with the fritters it makes the batter nice and crisp start crushing and use the back of the fork and just push it against the side of the bowl and then once you've mixed that through i'm gonna make that mix now slightly fragrant with some lime zest now the lime just really elevates the sort of richness and the denseness of the banana cover with clim film so it doesn't get a skin on top sit that in the fridge for 15 minutes as the banana fritter mixture rests i'm getting on with my broth for the noodle and clam soup fish stock is the base bring that up to the boil now to take that broth to another level in with chopped shallots fresh ginger add a whole chili seeds and all i actually quite like it spicy just chop once and into the broth bring up to the ball and let it simmer galangal it's sort of almost like a softer version of ginger slightly milder you can use galangal paste but i prefer the fresh stuff the stems for the coriander we'll finish the broth with the heads and that's what endeared me to the southeast asian style of cooking across my travels there was there's no waste in lime leaves for me one of my favorites incredibly pungent strong full of flavor very acidic but gives a really nice aroma to the broth just tear them in now the lemongrass so the secret here that's where all the flavor is right at the very end so you take the back of the knife and you just bash the lemongrass it's all that flavor is gonna run out in seconds that's the base of the broth done the longer you leave it the more intense it gets whilst the broth infuses soak your rice noodles in boiling water for 10 minutes just enough time to fry your fritters the batter now is ready use a metal spoon to drop the batter to the bottom of the pan i mean they hit that oil they puff up that's why it's important to put your spoon into the oil so the mixture runs off it creates this lovely little fritter and then gently fry get a slotted spoon and nice and carefully turn them over smell of that lime is extraordinary fry for two to three minutes as they start floating it signifies the fact that they're cooked off with a gas and just let them drained are those beauties lovely sprinkling when they're hot with a sugar actually sticks to them they're done ready to go the last job before serving the clams never be scared of cooking shellfish the most important rule is if they are slightly opened a millimeter discard it make sure muscles clams are always tight cook the clams for just three to five minutes or until they're all open bring that up to the boil and this is where we finish the broth touch of fish sauce a little sprinkle of sugar drain your noodles into the bowl for added texture some delicious bean sprouts get your lime fresh squeeze and lime juice in beautiful literally as the stock comes up to the boil the clams open automatically so they cook beautifully the flavor from inside the clam has enhanced the broth smell is incredible the clams cooked finish with fresh coriander and serve there you have perfect lunch a delicious spicy clam noodle with an amazing banana fritter my spicy clam noodle soup and banana and coconut fritters made in minutes and proof you only need to travel as far as your kitchen to get the taste of southeast asia [Music] succulent zingy prawn tostadas and for dessert salty caramel popcorn so good you'll want to eat it by the handful you can't beat properly home-cooked popcorn start off with just a touch of oil in there as it lightly starts to smoke corn in so now get your lid never leave it far away from you sounds like it's raining it's not so it's popcorn canals trying to pop out boom delicious just a little shake of the pan get it going and then lift that lid at your apparel we see it's a very exciting pan in there and when all that little pita pattern stops you know your popcorn is cooked nice you could eat it fresh from the pan but i've got another plan i'm gonna make a salted caramel popcorn start off with your sugar into the hot pan never stir a caramel otherwise it crystallizes it's a salted caramel so a nice pinch of salt in there as well now once you've got it to a really nice dark caramel flavor stir in your butter very carefully caramel is very very hot half a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda kickstarts the reaction that gives the caramel a honeycomb flavor mix that in you'll see it reacting almost like a large crunchy in the bottom of your bowl now the gas is off and that caramel has a nice dark rich flavor now pour in the popcorn to coat it with that incredible caramel give that a good mix it's that easy and it's gonna taste amazing lay that nice and flat once that cools down it becomes nice and brittle we've got that nice salted caramel flavor which just takes popcorn to complete dim level whilst the popcorn cools down it's onto my prawn tostada wonderful prawns gonna marinade them first with a little bit of garlic nice and fine [Music] and don't worry if you can't slice thinly just get a little grater and grate the garlic nice and fine as well nice pinch of chili flakes over your prawn garlic in salt pepper and olive oil give that a really nice little mix whilst the prawns marinade i'm gonna knock up a salad this is a really nice sort of light fragrant salad radishes topped and tailed and then into quarters cherry tomatoes halved spring onions sliced and seasoned and then just to liven things up a little bit of chili in there and slice them on an angle now the avocado cut in half give that a little twist so you just go down and down and down carefully with your knife turn it around go down and down and down and then you take your spoon and you've got your diced avocado coming out already now baby gem lettuce half then shred freshly squeezed lime juice and a little drizzle of olive oil tostada is a classic mexican style open tortilla so that lime complements it beautifully lastly roughly chop coriander and give it a mix that is the perfect base for our tostada the salad's ready now for the prawns and don't be afraid of getting the pan nice and hot teaspoon of olive oil in anything less than that sizzle when you put that first prawn in there don't put them in keep them nice and flat make sure you've got all that marinade in there as well watch them change color rapidly i'd rather cook them quicker in a hotter pan and slower in a colder pan the difference in taste is night and day the prawns will take just two minutes to cook through lime juice just over the top nice toss them over the lime these are corn tortilla quite robust and there's a kind of base that doesn't disintegrate hot pan in it's a dry pan so that corn tortilla goes nice and crispy on the outside [Music] look crispy shell to build them generous with the salad that base will stay nice and crisp next with your prawns i like to keep the tails in to the center and lay the round part of the prawn on the outside and there we have a delicious yeah very humble prawn tostada followed by my superb salty caramel popcorn beautiful [Music] prawn tostadas and salty caramel popcorn vibrant irresistible smelling dishes you'll want to dive into you

essential cooking tips starting with how to cook an ingredient that's perfect for a quick and easy tv dinner chicken breasts this has to be the most popular part of the chicken now it's very versatile incredibly tender very lean hardly any fat whatsoever the secret is cooking it without it becoming dry the first thing is to season it properly both sides two tablespoons of olive oil get the pan nice and hot the secret now is to get a really nice color on the skin really nice color no color no flavor skin side down tilt the pan so it cooks the back of the chicken breast where it's really nice and round and very fat let the pan do the work chicken breast normally takes between sort of 10 and 12 minutes to cook properly now we've got the color on the skin the skin's nice and crispy we're going to deglaze the pan deglaze with masala now masala has a sweet fortified italian wine you can also use white wine masala in flambe burn off the alcohol which gets rid of that really sort of harsh alcoholic flavor roll the chicken around the masala the glaze in the pan basically means washing the pan and lifting off all that flavor stuck to the bottom of the frying pan and put it into the sauce now chicken stock bring that up to the boil and let it simmer for three to four minutes [Music] it's really important to leave the chicken breast skin side up the skin's nice and crispy and it's important now the chicken cooks from underneath as it starts cooking it absorbs the stock so in the center of the chicken stays nice and moist [Music] now the stock of the masala is reduced down you can have the confidence to allow it to almost disappear and look the combination between the masala and the chicken stock is quite sweet so it finishes the chicken with this really nice delicious glaze on top and there you go a delicious succulent chicken breast with the most amazing flavoursome skin phenomenal soups make stunningly simple meals my tip for adding incredible depth of flavor is to always keep your leftover parmesan rinds store them in the freezer then add to the pan as the soup cooks and leaves to infuse then remove before serving is less waste and more taste another tip to take homemade soup to the next level whisk in cubes of cold butter just before serving to get a glossy velvety texture and a beautifully rich taste another fantastic standard for a frost-free weekend eat is the classic baked potato my tip for a great crispy skin is to use salt to your advantage simply add it to the outside before cooking and the salt will draw out the moisture in the oven as it bakes a touch of salt gives you an amazingly crisp skin on chicken and fish too as well as highlighting the flavor [Music] roasted nuts make a delicious tv snack my tip for peeling them with these is to simply toast them in the oven for about 10 minutes wrap in a tea towel and rub until the skins are removed perfect sprinkle with sea salt and so with a glass of wine this is my ultimate cookery course 100 recipes to stake your life on coming up i'll be showing you my amazing sweet corn fritters that is such a delicious recipe but first the key to whipping up my ultimate tv dinners is having

never without that will save you time and effort in the kitchen a grater and a peeler the swivel peeler a stainless steel one absolutely incredible it's almost like a lifesaver in the kitchen because they are so quick so light swivel blade so we've got so much more flexibility actually go around the vegetable and we call it speed peeler in the professional kitchen because it does literally absolutely rapidly peels your vegetables you have minimal waste good peelers cost them a couple of quid and are great for everything from peeling veg to finely slicing cheese and making shards of chocolate a good comfortable grip and a sharp stainless steel blade ensures you'll always work fast [Music] the box grater is another great versatile kitchen tool and with its planes for coarse grating fine grating and super fine as well as blades for slicing it's perfect for everything from puring ginger and zesting lemons to shredding onions super small so they can caramelize in a flash and be sure to get a solid handle to hold it firm and it's got such volume inside it doesn't crush everything up so i always prefer to grate onto a tray or into a bowl so you don't have to move it again creating onto the board you've always got to lift it up and place it in so place the grater into a bowl and grate two simple but essential speedy bits of kit guaranteed to make your life in the kitchen easier [Music] bread is a brilliant base for delicious super fast lunches and suppers here are three of my deliciously simple recipes that transform a humble bit of bread into a gastronomic treat first up flatbreads with fennel and feta add olive oil to a flatbread [Music] then place in a hot frying pan and toast until crisp and golden on both sides these deliciously versatile breads are made without yeast and are available in good supermarkets and local middle eastern shops next thinly slice fresh fennel and scatter over the toasted flatbread then toast aromatic fennel seeds in a hot dry pan and sprinkle on top [Music] crumble over wonderfully tangy feta cheese [Music] finish with a drizzle of sweet and sticky pomegranate molasses bread transformed before your eyes flatbreads with fennel and feta simple delicious and ready to eat in minutes my next recipe that turns a hunk of bread into a stunning dish is bruschetta with garlic tomatoes capers and pecorino [Music] start by slicing a baguette diagonally to get a large surface area so it holds more of the delicious topping drizzle the bread with extra virgin olive oil then place it oil side down onto a scorching hot griddle when the bread is beautifully charred remove and rub with a pill clove of garlic paint attention to the edges next half sweet cherry tomatoes and rub the juices into the toasted garlic bread then simply crush on top [Music] next slice and scatter over tangy caper berries and use a veg peeler to add shavings of salty pecorino cheese [Music] finally drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and add a twist of black pepper fantastic fresh flavors in the flesh of a griddle pan toast has never tasted so good [Music] perfect for a simple light supper or an easy lunch my next dish is the cannellini bean crustini with anchovy and olive oil [Music] first for the topping heat olive oil in a frying pan add tin cannellini beans along with the juices once heated gently mash the beans with a fork then add sliced black olives roughly chop parsley and a splash of sherry vinegar season and leave on a gentle heat next half a festive batter and splash with extra virgin olive oil heat a griddle

can still eat like a king incredible welcome back to my ultimate cookery course [Music] these are my perfect tv dinners next up my guide to getting the best ingredients for your money my shopping manta is very simple first rely on your senses make sure whatever you're buying it looks smells and really feels good and if you get the chance to taste it before you buy it then do it second is to recognize that knowledge is absolutely crucial the more you know about where your ingredients are from and how they produce the better so don't be scared ask lots of questions and learn and when you want a simple supper herbs are perfect to use in your cooking they add vibrancy an amazing depth of flavor and once you get the hang of them they are so quick and simple to use and one woman who really knows these chef's best friends is expert herb grower lorraine melton i love herbs i love the way you can cook with them i love the smell of them she's been growing an incredible array of herbs in the wet cambridgeshire countryside for over 20 years and can smell a bay from a basil at 50 paces we grow about 150 varieties of herbs it's always interesting to grow new varieties see what they taste like see what they smell like it gets a bit addictive after a while broadly speaking you get harder herbs and softer herbs softer herbs are things like parsley basil rocket coriander we grow two main types of parts so we've got flat leaf parsley and curly parsley flavour-wise i think they're very similar although a lot of people would say that the flat leaf parsley has got a stronger more aromatic flavour this is your common basil sweet genovese this is a purple variety called ruben we do greek basil thai basil holy basil when you're looking for a basil you want a bright fresh basil nice leaves no blemishes and nice strong stems it's got a lot of oils in it and it's very strong smelling it just tastes a summer basil lorraine certainly knows her stuff and she's right soft herbs are delicate so for maximum flavor always use them at the end of cooking or simply add as they are to cold dishes here are my top five soft herbs that i could never live without [Music] basil as lorraine said it comes in many types all with an amazing sweet punch and flavor great blitzed in pestos sprinkled whole over mozzarella and showing its versatility it even makes a wonderful ice cream parsley beautifully earthy and intensely fresh use both the leaves and the stem for great depth of flavor in savey dressing soups and salads coriander for an amazing hint of citrus often used in thai dishes coriander is perfect in curries and chutneys but it bruises easily so treat it with care tarragon a staple of french cooking this has long soft green leaves and a distinct anti-seed flavour great with chicken or in rich creamy sauces finally chervil both mild and sweet a perfect pairing with fish an incredible mix simply with melted butter for a quick sauce those are my favorite soft herbs what about the hard ones the harder ones tend to be a more woody plant things like thyme rosemary you've got your common time which is your ordinary general bog standard cooking time and then you've got things like lemon thyme we do an orange thyme which is actually one of my favorites it smells like thyme but it's got a deep sort of musky scent as well which is going to give you a slightly different flavor in your dish hard herbs like thyme can take more intense cooking than soft herbs so they're great in stews roast or pan frying choose the right one and you can add wonderful depth of flavor to your dishes here are my top five i use day in and day out rosemary amazingly robust with great bittersweet green leaves it's a classic pad with lamb delicious sprinkled over speciality breads like focaccia or great as toppings for fruity sorbets lorraine's favorite thyme a heady aromatic pungent herb which adds delicious flavor to a sunday roast it's amazing with wild mushrooms and is perfect in marinades oregano warm and full of delicious aromatic oils a staple of great italian dishes and perfect sprinkled on pizzas or in pasta sauces [Music] sage a strong tasting herb with a deliciously bitter flavour incredible in stuffings and with rich meats like pork or duck finally bay bitter sweet and spicy it's delicious simmered in soups stocks and risottos and just as good dried or fresh grown herbs is a lot easier than people think it is on winter boxes in balconies and it's great you can just open your window put your hand out and snip some off when you're out looking for hers make sure they're nice and healthy no blemishes stems look strong they should just spring back it's a nice springy sort of herbs smell obviously is quite important not all things smell but obviously if you think it's one that's going to smell like lemon thyme you should have a nice fresh lemon scent and obviously the final one is taste you can tip a bit off and taste your herbs and you can see what they taste like them whether bored from a supermarket or pig from your window box herb's a great way to add fresh flavors to your dishes perfect for delicious simple suppers even if you got a super busy lifestyle it doesn't mean missing out on delicious desserts they just have to be simple to make when it comes to cooking at home puddings should always be a pleasure and never a chore and homemade puds are 100 guaranteed to impress my next recipe has only two main ingredients but simplicity doesn't mean food can't taste out of this world incredible griddle pineapple with spiced caramel if you're making a dessert for one or two it's gonna be quick and easy this sumptuous delicious griddle pineapple fits the bill perfectly pineapple a way of testing it's nice and ripe top of the leaves come out perfect ready to go always cut a pineapple with a serrated edge knife slice off the bottom turn it back over and slice the top part now keep that for later look at the core the center of the pineapple and slice down directly in half slice that in half take each quarter and slice them smells incredible lay down flat and just slice that core off so you've got this perfect sort of boat of pineapple slice underneath but stop as you get right at the end slicing around the skin will make the pineapple easier to eat but leaving it attached gives you more control as it cooks next heat a griddle pan as hot as you can start off in the corner and push it down so you really mark the pineapple two minutes on each side and then just turn them really nice color there look at that beautiful i'm gonna sprinkle them with a little touch of sugar that's gonna glaze them now slice the top take out these beautiful glazed slices of pineapple next up the spiced caramel now start off with your pan nice and hot sprinkle four tablespoons of sugar in there just flatten it then add the seeds from a fresh vanilla pod in a small dusting of chinese fly spice never stir caramel let it sort of bubble and transform here she goes now i've got the colour i want it that's the perfect color off with the gas in with the butter and then a couple of tablespoons of cream lovely and then give that a little whisk add the rest of your cream nice and just drip that spicy caramel over your pineapple hmm wow simple elegant and seriously impressive griddle pineapple with spiced caramel a delicious treat all to yourself that tastes even better shared [Music] next my tricks of the trade and kitchen tips first up the proper way to chop fresh herbs to get maximum flavor chopping herbs the secret is to chop them not bruise them now basil this is a soft herb so treat it with some respect when people go mad chopping herbs all the goodness comes out on the board i want the goodness left inside the basil place them all inside one another with the largest leaf at the bottom and it's almost like rolling a cigar large one at the bottom small ones in the center and then look place them down together and just roll them nice and gently don't bruise them step one rolled ready to slice sharp knife imperative fingers tucked in the bottom part of your knuckle is the guide between you and the herbs that there stops you from cutting your finger really important to get comfortable with a knife and just practice rolling the knife across the board and relaxing that wrist it's all in the wrist action so herbs up fingernails tucked underneath and just up and down up and down and there you have a chopped basil that's not bruised and smelling very fragra right coriander so you get the bunch of coriander hold it down and just lightly shave the leaves off the stalks bunch them up together and then just again let the knife do the work take the fingernails in and just chop once and once only don't hack it just chop it you can always identify when you bruise the herb when you've removed the herbs off the board there's a big green patch mmm full of flavour and none of the goodness is left on the chopping board a great tip for using leftover herbs simply chop finely mix into butter roll up in clim film and freeze then when you want a herby hit cut into slices and melt over steaks chicken or veg asparagus is great for a simple supper to prepare always remove the lower woody stem by gently bending and the asparagus will snap at the perfect point then boil or steam and serve with a little of my herb butter for a cracking soft boiled egg simply place your egg in boiling water add a splash of vinegar and cook for exactly eight minutes then plunge into ice water the vinegar helps the shell peel off easily and the ice water stops the egg from cooking giving you the perfect runny yolk [Music] for fuss-free salad dressings simply add the ingredients into a jam jar

Pre-order your copy...",2022-12-01 22:16:02.926159, [Music] lightly fried my delicious halloumi and courgette cakes squeeze every last bit of flavor out of those vegetables but first i'm preparing a simple slow roast tomato and watercress salad these cherry tomatoes are perfect if you haven't got cherry tomatoes vitamins are good or even just big normal plump tomatoes lay the tomatoes on the tray and these go into the oven for about 90 minutes if you turn the oven down really low you can leave them in overnight to be honest the longer you leave them the better they taste once you've seasoned with salt sprinkle over with some sugar and the salt and sugar combine speeds up the drying process because you want that nice chewy texture and then you get these little time flowers and just pick off the buds garlic sliced then just spread that on now the tray looks quite full and compact but 90 minutes in the oven you'll see everything shrink down all the skins blistering and the flavor intensifies so nicely extra virgin olive oil that gives a nice earthy flavor to the tomatoes place your tomatoes into an oven preheated to 150 degrees c and cook long and slow for an hour and a half now halloumi cakes there's something quite exciting about halloumi cheese it's a very firm cheese and it fries brilliantly peel the carrots [Music] great not too finely you want that nice texture next courgette the secret is keep it all grated the same put that into a sieve [Music] a sprinkling of salt will draw out liquid from the vegetables then grate the halloumi halloumi cheese doesn't look that tasty but once you've got color on it in the pan it's really really delicious now really important to squeeze out the excess water from the veg and we'll see all that water that needs to come out of there if you didn't do this it'll make your little patties non-friable because the whole thing starts to separate and then mix in with the cheese spring onions chop up the whites and the greens now we're going to season that with some delicious fresh mint and fresh coriander whenever it's vegetarian i like to put a combination of herbs in there tarragon parsley mint and coriander basil and lemongrass all delicious on their own but in tandem their flavours play off each other next two eggs in give that a little mix add the eggs to the mixture and then finally a couple of tablespoons of breadcrumbs the breadcrumbs help dry out any excess moisture mix all the ingredients together before you start shaping these taste the mixture hmm it's really important to identify the seasoning now if you wait until you've cooked them it'll be too late to adjust the seasoning roll them to a large golf ball shape them like a little mini burger you could spice these up with some chili in there if you haven't got fresh chili chili flakes and it's something that can be done up a day in advance to get your cakes firm and ready for frying put them into the fridge uncovered for 25 minutes pan on get that nice and hot while i'm waiting for that i'll get the dressing ready slice the red chili seeds and all on an angle into shards then chop fresh ginger season with a sprinkle of sugar and salt add some rice wine vinegar add a couple of tablespoons of olive oil to finish off some chopped coriander [Music] got that sweet sour spicy flavor with my chilli dressing done i can start frying off my halloumi cakes in a hot oiled pan we've got a nice crisp edge you can already start to smell that sauteed halloumi with the courgettes and carrots smells delicious really important for a nice amount of colour on them as my cakes sizzle away i can finish off my roast tomato salad one of my favorite leaves has to be watercress just cut off stalks [Music] shallot rings watercress and shallot go brilliantly well together the shallot looks so dainty when you open up these little ringlets don't forget to turn your cakes now tomatoes whatever you don't use just jar them and put them in the fridge [Music] just drop those slow cooked warm tomatoes over the watercress the sweetness is incredible absolutely delicious a little drizzle of age of smooth vinegar gives that tartness to the watercress watercress is naturally peppery so it doesn't need any pepper just a little touch of salt and then a light sprinkling of extra virgin olive oil after five minutes on a medium heat my halloumi cakes are ready so important to have taken out that water [Music] you can see it doesn't disintegrate and then just get your dressing take a spoon of it and then tilt it to the side because i want the garnish i don't want the juice if that does not turn you on to become a vegetarian for the night i honestly don't know what will delicious [Music] my crispy golden halloumi courgette and herb cakes with a sumptuous roast tomato and watercress salad all of the flavor with none of the meat when i was growing up my mom was a very very good cook so we had some great food but it was always meat and too veg and the veg definitely played a bit part but the more attention you pay to cooking vegetables the more you realize they can easily take center stage for all the flavor with known the flesh here's my ultimate vegetarian dinner first a hearty starter a bruschetta with ricotta and succulent griddle courgettes for my main i'm serving fragrant roasted beetroot and thyme risotto [Music] but i'll be in trouble with the kids if i don't do a pud so i'm enlisting the help of my youngest tilly to rustle up an indulgent chocolate and lime mousse with crushed raspberries [Music] so if you want to wrap the chocolate start breaking up in little bits we're going to make the most amazing white chocolate mousse our first job is to bring half of our cream up to the boil so what kind of cream is that in there dad that is double cream okay so that's gonna make a really nice rich chocolate mousse what's your favorite sort of chocolate is it white milk dark um i love white and milk what's yours i absolutely love milk chocolate oh that's my guilty pleasure is it really here we go cream in so that goes in there now you can see what's happening straight away can't you it's melting really quickly melting really quickly so okay oh excuse me at least your jumper's white so you won't spot it yeah i've got a nice little snack for later in another bowl add lime zest cold cream and whisk until it forms soft peaks the lime cuts the sort of richness of the cream and that starts to make the chocolate mousse taste a little bit lighter mmm it smells really good the lime gives it a really nice zingy zenith you're absolutely right next add to the melted chocolate mixture because i'm whisking it's just getting lighter and lighter and lighter have a little taste nice yeah the lime gives it a really nice taste telly i need the rest for the mousse i need them for my tummy no come on chocolate moves into the fridge our next job is to separate out three egg whites this is why i need you at your absolute best okay because to whip those whites it's gonna be really tough so we'll take it in turns 30 seconds each okay you go first seconds gone come on tilly 15 seconds gone 20 seconds gone come on you can do it 10 seconds to go five four three two one and change exit hold the ball right no no way [Music] this puny little thing and you come with a big little machine gun that's the best way of whipping up egg whites start tipping that sugar in slowly our contentious whipped egg whites will make our mousse light and airy and when they've reached soft peaks we can gently mix in our cool white chocolate and cream mixture once the egg whites hit the cream yeah the chocolate sets the egg whites keep the cream nice and fluffy and you get this nice light mousse in the bowl now i need you to crush some raspberries please with some fresh mint you can see all the juice coming out now take your mousse wow that looks really cool now look at that down the bottom there now a crushed raspberry delicious now i'm going to set that in the fridge if you can use the kind of dough please our yummy white chocolate mousse will take at least two hours to set so we can crack on with our mediterranean-inspired vegetarian starter griddle courgette ricotta and mint bruschetta for this recipe you'll need a griddle pan an essential piece of kit for that char grill look cut thick slices of chapatta bread drizzle both sides with olive oil season with a little salt and pepper and griddle each side until toasted then slice a couple of courgettes diagonally into half a centimetre thick pieces drizzle and coat in olive oil and season with salt and pepper sear on a smoking hot griddle pan in batches until all the coughettes are bar marked on both sides next roughly chop mint leaves and combine with creamy ricotta cheese spread your toasty topata with dollops of minty ricotta and top with your seared courgette super simple and super tasty now we're gonna make a delicious beetroot risotto we need to get the shallots just slice them in half and then just chop them like that okay okay now have you ever made a risotto no i haven't actually shallots please into the pan for daddy add a sprinkle of salt and pepper along with a couple of crushed cloves of garlic once you start cooking the risotto it's really important to have your stock gently boiling away if we're adding cold stock on top of the rice all the time it just slows down the process generally you cook a nice wide flat pan if you cook in a deep pan all the rice sort of cooks at different temperatures what stock is that in there dad because that's a vegetable stock yeah because you can't have different stocks if it's more vegetarian can you have chicken stock i made that mistake one's putting beef stock in the vegetarian soup did you no i didn't matilda are you sure i'm positive i'm joking fry off the time how nice does that smell it smells delicious rice in that's a bit of a different rice this is elboria rice it's a perfect rice for risotto now it's really important to sear the rice if we just put the stock in without sweating off the rice it goes all starchy so keep on stirring for daddy it's just going to make a formula no flambe on the risotto to go with our deep red beetroot theme i'm adding red wine followed by the first ladle of stock to get things started now we're off wow it's giving it a cloudy sort of look what's happening to the stock the stock is reducing down and the rice is sucking it in that's right so the rice is actually getting nice and plump one of risotto is live when it's like this now we can't stop cooking there we have to kill it all the way okay ready for the next ladle i'm ready good girl here we go ladle in so we have to make this for literally 20 25 minutes and we're nursing it all the way beetroots peel them rub them a little bit of salt and sugar yeah and a little bit of aged balsamic barcelona in there roasted them i'm gonna grate my parmesan how's that rice doing the rice is doing good now that is exactly where we want to be now look look at that nice glossy textured rice so beetroot i want you to put two thirds of the beetroot in there for me saving one third for the top good sprinkle the parmesan in there for me please all over nice looks like it's snowing again and then we're just gonna get some nice butter in there the butter gives the risotto a really nice gloss look at that beautiful let that come down let it come down first all right get your spoon in there now for daddy beautifully there you go good wonderful shake it risotto should be like lava it just flows out and then the rest of the beetroot on top and then finish and some extra virgin olive oil on top i'll pick up the bruschetta you take that to the table okay let's go danny this is my ultimate vegetarian dinner delicious courgette ricotta and mint top bruschetta an anxious roasted beetroot and thyme risotto and for put an indulgent white

#GordonRamsay...",2022-12-01 22:16:02.926159, now for the perfect way to ease yourself into the day it's my guide to brunches [Music] brunch is simply a delicious combination of breakfast and lunch and for me it's all about getting up late and having a wonderful lazy start to the weekend with fantastic food more exciting than breakfast and a lot more enjoyable to cook brunch is ideal for sharing first up my simple and delicious frittata eggs are great they are so versatile and once you've mastered how to cook them trust me the door then opens to a wide range of delicious options this is like a triple omelette but a lot more ingredients than a normal mesh we'll start off with some lovely smoked bacon slice the bacon bacon in those salts little touch of pepper start off on a high heat get that bacon really nice and crispy otherwise you just boil the bacon and it's got that soft unpleasant texture in the frittata turn down the gas and now start adding your veg roughly chop a red pepper and add it to the pan the peppers and the bacon take the longest so they've always got to go in first now soak them off the peppers have been cooked now from that sort of rendered fat from the bacon and then the spring onions just bunch them up slice them i want them on an angle so they come like little green diamonds spring onions in now for the eggs cracking the eggs for that size pan seven or eight eggs i want to fill it right to the very top and more importantly when i turn this out i want it like a gato nice and thick so slice through and see all those wonderful verge [Music] i'm going to season the eggs with some parmesan cheese be quite generous because it adds a really nice saltiness [Music] fresh ground pepper and then whisk whisk up those eggs nicely [Music] then add peas to the pan and to give the dish a wonderful aromatic freshness some fragrant chopped basil i want to chop that sort of roughly because i want to see those flecks of green going in i want it looking charming and how many times have you seen a dull omelet frittatas in my mind really helped encapsulate the magic of having savory eggs cooked beautifully but with texture now just before we add the eggs i've got this beautiful little goat cheese and it's strong and powerful so i want to slice it into little chunks and then just have it dotted around i want to discover these little pockets of creamy goat's cheese now slowly add the eggs [Music] fill that right up and get your spoon now just let all that egg go down to the bottom bring it back up to the boil and sort of clean around the sides and then some of this delicious salty creamy goat's cheese over the top now i want it melting like a a perfect slice on toast nice now from there turn the grill on for four to five minutes [Music] now just looking at that delicious take a little paring knife and just make sure it's released on the sides just take your panel tap that will hopefully release the frittata from the bottom of the pan now the board over the panel turn that gently and just shake say a little prayer and lift off back beautiful [Music] now from there on there it's there look now slice through you can see how soft and creamy that is in the center and that goat's cheese is just melting almost like a little sauce inside it's so exciting but more importantly so easy to do it's got texture it's got creaminess and that for me will beat any omelette for brunch serve with a stack of hot buttered toast and a steaming pot of coffee this easy frittata turned the humble egg into the perfect dish for kicking off the weekend [Music] eggs are really versatile protein packed and delicious here are three more of my favorite recipes to give your brunches a tasty twist [Music] first up north african eggs [Music] add olive oil to a hot pan and fry finely chopped onions and red and green peppers [Music] then chop garlic and chili and cook until softened chili's worked brilliantly with eggs giving the dish a lovely hot kick next add fresh chopped tomatoes then cumin seeds and fry until the seeds are fragrant and the tomatoes are lovely and soft season next make wells in your spicy sauce and crack in your eggs then cover and cook on a low heat for five minutes so the whites are set and the yolks are still lovely and runny to finish slice spring onions and coriander and simply sprinkle over fresh spicy and deliciously different easy north african eggs ready in under 20 minutes and this worth getting up late for next eggs made super indulgent for brunch cheat souffle with three cheeses [Music] mix together flour sugar baking powder and season make it well in the center then simply beat six eggs together pour into the well and whisk into the flour then whisk in milk making the mixture lovely and light next add the three cheeses cottage cheese grated monterey jack or cheddar [Music] and cream cheese and then for extra richness knobs of butter then butter a baking dish and pour in your rich cheesy cheats souffle mix now put in a medium oven and bake for 40 minutes until rich golden and puffed to perfection a stunning fuss-free souffle that's ideal for brunch my next easy egg dish is a salty and succulent prawn and feta omelet [Music] pour olive oil into a hot pan add chopped tomatoes spring onions and fry season [Music] next add cooked prawns and a sprinkle of chilli flakes to give it a lovely kick of heat cook through and set aside next beat four eggs add olive oil to your frying pan and pour in the eggs sprinkle on freshly chopped oregano which works brilliantly with eggs then spoon over the spicy prawns crumble over creamy feta cheese and grill for a couple of minutes this is eggs to the nth degree packed with different tastes textures and flavors all working wonderfully together perfect one super versatile ingredient three mouthwateringly different recipes brunch has never been better nice next my tricks to the trade and kitchen tips first up red pepper as you've seen great for frittata and north african eggs but you need to know how to cut them properly i absolutely love these peppers now they have the most amazing sweet delicious flavor with a really nice crunchy texture and the most exciting thing about the peppers is that they're just as delicious raw or cooked to identify the perfect pepper must be smooth and firm and not a wrinkle inside now how to cut the perfect pepper stalk off pepper down and get the knife start from the top and slice all the way around basically we're going to be slicing around the seeds look no faffing around like this little perfect christmas tree of seeds and you haven't got the mess all over your board and more importantly it's twice as quick discard that now we're going to cut it into a julienne flatten the pepper skin side down onto the board because it's a lot easier to slice through the pepper and just lift the knife up and down and basically julienne is a chef's word for strips these are absolutely perfect for sauteing and that's what we're looking for there crunchy delicious and more importantly no seeds beautiful many great brunch recipes start with a delicious fresh egg my tried and tested way to tell if your egg is fresh is to simply place it into a bowl of cold water a fresh egg will sink and a stale one will float if a small piece of shell goes into the bowl when you're cracking eggs my tip for removing it is to simply use a larger piece to fish it out it works like magic for prize winning fried eggs fry them in oil adding a tablespoon of water then cover the water steams the top of the egg to perfection toasted bagels are brilliant for brunch my tip to make sure you always have them on hand is to stock up your freezer but make sure you slice them first that way you can pop them straight into your toaster [Music] this is my ultimate cookery course a hundred recipes to stake your life on i'm about to show you my recipe for delicious spicy pancakes tuck it underneath there pull it back and roll but first here's my guide to buying beautiful eggs knowledge is crucial the more you know about where your ingredients are from and how they produce the better in my home kitchen i use eggs in abundance they are so versatile and getting to grips with them will make your cooking sing girlies with a decade of experience under her belt helen from harrah's farm in hertfordshire is a real egghead and has some valuable tips to share the hens we keep are designed to lay probably 300 350 eggs a year free range means that the bird must have access to the outside at all times chickens love grass they peck it whatever's on the ground and it makes the eggs a lovely rich golden color and the flavour is tremendous to tell if an egg is really fresh crack it open put it on a dish and you will see that it sits up really quite high and the white is really nice and tight around the side of the yoke there's a vast range of eggs out there to experiment with why stick to what you know try living up your brunches with something different this is a bantum egg they are miniature chickens the yolks are quite large compared to the whites of the egg and they're absolutely delicious making scrambled eggs of them because they're much more creamier all together than say a chicken's egg this is the duck's egg these ones are sort of an off-white color but they can be sort of creamy greeny colors compared to chicken eggs the duck's yolk is richer and creamier and the white is fluffier when whisks which is why they're so incredible for bacon this is the goofs egg this is quite a large egg it's probably equivalent to three chicken eggs the geese literally lay for about 12 weeks from my few geese we've had about 120 eggs they're amazing layers but just for the very short season the amazing thing is the color of the yolks of these they are usually quite orange the geese don't actually eat anything other than grass they are just grazers and that makes a huge difference to the color of the yolk another fantastic egg is the quail egg tiny but incredibly tasty they only take a minute to soft boil and are delicious dipped in celery salt if you've got a big appetite or you're making a brunch for a big group of friends you could try the giant rare egg from south america the equivalent of 10 hen eggs they're great scrambled or as a massive omelet another interesting option is the pheasant egg small but rich in flavor they're perfect for homemade scotch eggs or hard boiled in a salad you can keep eggs in your fridge but ideally when you go to use them take them out bring them up to room temperature because you'll find that they will cook better just make sure that there's no cracks in them and then you'll be assured that they're nice healthy tasting eggs [Music] brunch should be a laid-back affair and a treat so the dishes need to be easy to cook but never boring my next recipe takes the humble pancake to a whole new level of flavor and excitement soft fiery and irresistible spicy pancakes one of the secrets to good cooking is learning to use your imagination when it comes to brunches you don't have to stick to the old standbys these delicious spicy pancakes are really great alternative but more importantly so easy to do start off by toasting your cumin [Music] it's a dry roast basically non-stick pan just a touch of seasoning the salt helps to dry out the cumin even more and then fresh ginger slice them nice and thinly stack it back up and then just slice nice little thin slices in there and then keep that bunched up shake the chilli removing the seeds will prevent things getting too hot now garlic nice now add olive oil to your toasted cumin seeds and then with the garlic ginger and chili lovely [Music] and it feels strange when you talk about garlic for breakfast but the time i spent in india everybody was eating something savory for breakfast it was extraordinary into your bowl and set aside next the pancake filling add olive oil to a hot pan mustard seeds in now they'll start dancing the minute they hit the pan then finely slice an onion onions in a little teaspoon of turmeric sprinkle that in and look at the color an instant change leftover potatoes just slice them the smell is incredible potatoes in now spread the potatoes across the pan all the potatoes stained i want them sort of absorbing all that really nice turmeric actually like a sponge season those potatoes and it really helps to bring out the spice beautifully they're ready turn off the gas and let them sit there and absorb all those flavors back to the pancake batter add plain flour to your cooled garlic chili ginger and cumin seeds a touch of salt and pepper nothing worse than the bland pancake one whole egg milk hold the jug with one hand and whisk with a secret to get that really nice smooth paste but whisk in that egg first and brings it together and then you're milking don't put all the milk in because then you're gonna get a lumpy pancake mix and if you put less milk in it really helps it not going lumpy look at that milk here the secret for me is to have a nice thin mix now just a little teaspoon of oil that helps to bring a nice crispy edge to the mixture now just taste it that's the texture pan on the larger the pan the better it helps to create a nice thin even surface i want that mix going all the way around the pan before you put the mixture into the pan make sure you give your pancake mix a really nice stir pan it's nice and hot turn down the gas a touch of olive oil in get that nice whisk with one hand pan to the mix in one and a half ladles and then roll it around which is really nice and thin i want to see the ginger the garlic that's what i'm looking for in there now back onto the heat it only starts to remove from the bottom of the pan and lifts itself up once it's cooked these little bubbles confirm that it's just starting to lift off the pan a little shake that releases it and then just shake it to the end and toss if you haven't got the confidence tossing then use a spatula and turn it over now that's exactly what i want that nice sort of crisp edge around the side the color on the pancake is so important now roll it round and just let it slide out beautifully now for the exciting part filling them take your potatoes just sort of have a really nice imaginary line and then just very carefully roll that nice and tightly tuck it underneath there pull it back and roll the delicious pancakes are ready to eat but with a simple dipping sauce they'll be a real treat just mix chopped coriander with natural yogurt that's really nice cooling agent sit there on the side and that for me is a great brunch delicious spicy pancakes amazing [Music] follow my ultimate

great way of relaxing with friends and family not taking yourself or anything else too seriously and brunch dishes should reflect that spicy sweet or savory anything goes and one of my all-time favorites a dish that always creates a stir is the daddy of all brunches steak sandwiches [Music] for me the secret of a great brunch is fun and casual fuss-free cooking and everyone helping themselves this is the ultimate steak sandwich you want the rolls royce of beef it has to be fillet now season it beautifully i like to open up the top of the peppermill to increase the size of the pepper in the steak so it gives that bit of heat nice little chunks you just roll now nicely all the way around now slice the garlic in half pan nice and hot olive oil in [Music] hold the steak and just place it into the pan don't drop it at the front of the pan we're going to tilt the pan forward to cook the back of the steak dual purpose now roll it back and sear underneath next my garlic and roast that garlic time fry that time i want to hear it we're not looking for a lot of color because you're going to dry out the fill it so just one end turn it back down and stir the other end in lift up your time place it on top of the garlic there lift up your fillet and sit there on top of your garlic butter in take a spoon tilt the pan gently lift up and baste i've got that scented garlic thyme flavor the steak is going to cook evenly because it's sat on a little a little bed in the oven for 8 to 10 minutes [Music] pan on for the relish you think of a steak sandwich you think of a sort of nice heated tomato relish to make the relish finely dice a red onion three finger rule one in front two behind through and chop wow next roughly chop a chilli keeping the seeds in for extra heat start off with the olive oil into a pan onions chili [Music] generous with the olive oil i want a nice sort of rich silky relish from there take your tomatoes you can't just use red tomatoes but these yellow and red make the perfect combination now put your salt in pepper and then roast those tomatoes off take a wooden spoon and just sort of break them up once the skins blister the whole tomato just starts to release all that really nice sweet texture a little teaspoon of cherry vinegar gives that nice acidic balance the sweetness of the tomatoes turn down the gas and just let them sort of stew perfectly now a steak sandwich would not be complete unless it had the most amazing mustard mayonnaise simply add three tablespoons of mayonnaise to three teaspoons of whole grain mustard [Music] now i've got the reddish almost down to like a really nice jam now i want to make that relish a little bit more fragrant some basil slice it through and sprinkle that basil in there [Music] beautiful look at this there she is my crown jewels time to take it out smell is incredible just baste one more time to fill it touch is quite soft in the center so it's just coming up to mid-rare let it rest the same time you cooked it it'll be nice and pink evenly throughout the steak to make my sandwich i'm going to char grill some sliced chipatta bread season it nicely just a little drizzle of olive oil i want to get that bread nice and crispy pan nice and hot bread in push it down smell is amazing that char sort of charcoal flavor once you've got those marks on the bread it just stops the bread from becoming soggy and look at this here it is stunning on slice it gently one beautiful slice wow it's nice and pink all the way through and the beef is so soft it's almost like slicing through butter let the knife do the work take a little bit of mayonnaise spread that the back of the spoon on both sides next lettuce take that beautiful slice of beef and then relish on top of that beef and just slice the sandwich in half beautiful now that's what i call a steak sandwich trust me serve the sublime sandwich for brunch and you'll put a smile on everyone's face [Music] next up my guide to buying the best beef and steaks if you want the ultimate brunch you can't do any better than start with a perfect steak and one man who really knows his steak is master butcher danny lidgate steak is my favorite type of meat and i think it's really good to enjoy different varieties of steak when choosing a steak that you want you need to look at exactly what you want out of it for my ultimate steak sandwich i used to fill it because it's the most tender the fillet does the least amount of work than all the other muscles is tucked away in the ribcage this means that when you're buying a fillet it's incredibly soft like butter it's the most expensive but you get what you pay for there's a wide array of cuts to choose from all different in taste and texture if in doubt ask your butcher this would be the rump section where the rump comes from which is basically the back side take the bone out and what you're left with is a wonderful steak rum steak characteristically a little bit tougher than the sirloin or a little bit chewier than the ribeye but a really strong flavor for the steak again when frying rum look for the marbling try and get some fat covering on the steak you can always cut it off after it's cooked rumps one of the best value steaks i love it thinly cut and flash fried in stir fries or simply marinated and whacked on the barbecue another great value but delicious cut is the hangar steak known as the butcher's cut because they often keep it for themselves it's great marinated and cooked quickly with the sirloin which is basically the back of the animal a nice sirloin like this really well marbled don't buy too lean so once the sirloin is trimmed up it looks something like this not too much fat but you need a little bit to cooking it next to the sirloin is the rib really popular now with eyes small nice really tender juicy steaks it's really especially good for barbecuing or grilling fantastic probably my favorite steak would be a rib eye rib eye is especially delicious because the marbling in the meat loads it with flavor for a full-on steak experience try the t-bone steak with a small tender fillet steak on one side of the bone and a larger flavoursome sirloin on the other [Music] take your butcher's advice and you won't go wrong the final word has to go to danny when buying me knowledge really is power so it's important to ask as many questions about the meet you're buying find out the breed how it's aged and decide exactly what you want to do each particular job that should then give you a really amazing end product [Music] the great thing about brunch is there are no rules the only thing i insist on are it's got to be fuss-free easy to cook and so delicious it puts you in a good mood for the rest of the day and for me pancakes always hit the spot here are three of my deliciously different recipes certified to liven up your mornings first up fluffy blueberry and ricotta pancakes with yogurt [Music] start by adding

effortless recipes guaranteed to bring some sparkle to your brunches incredible welcome back to my ultimate cookery course i'm teaching you all about brunches the most laid-back meal of the week and if you want to take it easy having the right equipment makes all the difference [Music] here's my guide to the best kitchen equipment everything you need to know about the basic kit that will get you cooking fantastic food chopping boards for brunch one of the most useful things is a great chopping board get the right one and it'll be your friend for life i prefer a sort of heavy duty one because they're so much more durable they can be flipped over the minute you want to go from vegetables to prepping fish or meat always keep a little jake off underneath that actually stops the board from sliding carefully wooden board by rubbing it with oil every so often any cooking oil will do wooden boards for me are always the best easy to clean and long lasting when you do wash your wooden board never let it stand in water or put it in the dishwasher as it may split buy the best you can afford and take good care of it [Music] for brunch i'd love something sweet and i've always been a fan of classic british crumpets with butter and jam but once you try cooking them at home you'll never want to buy them from shops again this is another great recipe you can stake your life on it's my homemade crumpet whether you're cooking for two three or even a gang some of the best brunch dishes are always the simplest these crumpets are absolutely delicious and it's a great end to a fantastic brunch first off we're gonna make the mix what do you think of growing up the smell and the taste of amazing crumpet and never leaves you to make the mix the secret is to bring the milk up the ball but do not boil it the minute it boils turn it off and let it sit there now flour in a nice pinch of salt in now add half a teaspoon of bicarb that gives it aeration and really lifts the mixture up all those lovely little holes a nice pinch of sugar and then a teaspoon of yeast dry yeast now once the milk's boiled turn it off and add some warm water about 10 tablespoons 150 mil that cools down the milk but more importantly it doesn't destroy the yeast half of the milk in first stop and give that a really good mix now the rest of it [Music] [Music] you can just see that there's no lumps through there as it drips through the whisk now we're looking for it to double in size and get nice and light so pop in a warm place whilst you get on with the delicious topping [Music] beautiful strawberries but caramelized almost like a very quick strawberry jam hang on [Music] just slice these in half some sugar a couple of tablespoons we're gonna take the sugar to a nice light caramel it's just starting to change color now turn the gas down and we're gonna add the strawberries beautiful just sweating the strawberries down quickly and the caramel's breaking down a wonderful glaze on the strawberries some lemon grated into the strawberries gives it that kind of freshness that really starts to break down the strawberries nice gas up smells incredible some lemon juice a touch of balsamo vinegar and that gives it that really nice delicious tartness now off it goes as the strawberries start to cool down it will naturally thicken and set beautifully nice [Music] now for the crumpet it's almost doubled in size but be very careful you don't knock the bowl because it can sort of push out all that air it's aerated it's nice it's light just see the texture she's ready to go did you boil it here we go instead of making normal small crumpets i'm making a giant one ideal for sharing now turn the gas down you can just start to see a traditional crumpet-style cooking process we want those nice tiny little holes on top and that crispy crunchy base right now it's time to add the butter just slide the butter down the back that gives it a really nice nutty flavor at the end fish nice flip beautiful take that out take the jam spoon over the secret is for the juice to sort of run inside all those little holes think of that tartness of the balsamic vinegar the strawberries beautifully soft and almost pureed wrapped in that delicious caramel now finish that with a nice ball of creme fraiche let that sit there and that is an amazing way of finishing off a traditional brunch with something sweet something delicious and something you're dying to tuck into [Music] next my tricks of the trade and kitchen tips fruit can be a great healthy option for brunch and knowing how to get the best out of it can make all the difference first up how to peel and cut a mango the easy way holding your stalk end up cut either side of the stone cut all the way into the flesh making squares without cutting through the skin then turn it inside out and carefully cut your pieces off a great tip to check if a pineapple is ripe is to pull a leaf out from the top if it comes away easily it's ripe and ready for slicing my tip to get the flesh out of a kiwi is to simply cut the fruit in half and scoop it out with a teaspoon try it it really works if you have fruit that's not perfectly ripe the tip is to put a banana in a paper bag then add your unripe fruit put it in a dark place and the banana will speed up the ripening process of the other fruit you can make a great fruit puree to accompany a brunch pancake or a crumpet in a blender to clean it afterwards add a cup of warm water and run the machine for a few seconds empty out then simply repeat with a drop of washing up liquid

these tacos mix a mexican and japanese flavors into a delicious meaty mouthful first off get that pan really nice and hot these are sirloin steaks sear it in the pan with all that fat on they'll add flavour salt and pepper couple tablespoons of olive oil in pan nice and hot hold up the steak and lay it in always lay away give the panna a little shake and it stops the steak from sticking we're looking for color and if it sticks it's gonna burn [Music] while the steaks are cooking i can get on with my super quick marinade now two tablespoons of misood paste that's a fermented soy bean that gives a really nice sort of rich sweetness tablespoon of sugar a couple of tablespoons rice wine that gives it a really nice vinegary kick a couple of tablespoons of olive oil salt and pepper i'm looking for a nice sort of thick rich marinade marinade done it's time to turn the steaks sort the pan and to give the steaks a little base all we're doing every time is just adding more more flavor take your tongs and sort of lift the steak on its back and really melt all that fat down offer the gas take them out just take your knife see all that fat there just slice that off i don't want any of that now in to the marinade [Music] beautiful tacos are one of mexico's most popular street foods they've been made from beef pork chicken or fish and are loaded up with amazing sauces and spices now i want something sort of pickly cabbage these are um chinese cabbages slice it in half look at it really crisp and really tasty we're gonna slice that into quarters and then just shred it and take your time you think of cabbage here and you think you're sort of braised overcooked cabbage nothing worse but at a taco you want freshness a little season of chili flakes they sort of discreetly give it a little bit of heat a little touch of rice wine vinegar if you haven't got that fresh lemon juice a small drop of toasted sesame seed oil give that a really good mix now i need something to sort of bring it together we take some wasabi paste very hot very spicy a sort of thumbnail size i'm gonna mix that with a couple of tablespoons of mayonnaise and give that a really good mix these are basic corn tortilla the trick is to sort of color them and then shape them actually place it on the gas ring use some tongs so it's not to burn yourself you can also toast your tacos in a frying pan from there i'm just going to place it on the rolling pin literally 30 seconds as it cools down the great thing about serving tacos is people can fill them themselves just the way they want them cabbage just squeeze out wet marinade nice rustic little mountain mayonnaise on wait you see how soft and delicious and almost sort of melting in the mouth texture we've got on this amazing sirloin it's got that really nice sear around the outside it's just nice and pink in the middle start off with my crispy shell back of the spoon with the wasabi mayonnaise inside taco and just sprinkle that delicious pickled cabbage and then just start lining my taco three or four slices touch more on my spicy mayo and that is how i'd make the perfect taco [Music] malt chocolate donuts street food is all about satisfying your cravings these donuts are sweet sticky and absolutely delicious first off we're gonna make the dough now this dough takes a bit of time but it's really exciting i'm heating all of the milk with the sugar this yeast easy to get hold of now when you make fresh donuts you need fresh yeast adding some of the warm milk to the yeast will activate it which will help the dough to rise just half give that a quick whisk the sugar is dissolved in the milk the fresh yeast disintegrates instantly set the yeast mixture to one side while it does its job to start the main dough mix i'm adding half the butter to the remaining milk that gives the dough a nice silkiness i want it light so melt the butter into the milk flour into a sieve that helps to make the dough nice and smooth and you know what when you've got a smooth dough it sort of rises evenly add a pinch of salt and two egg yolks pour in the warm milk and melted butter don't start over mixing it when you over mix the dough of the doughnut it gets really tight you're not gonna let it ariel yeast in nice and warm i love that smell now i'm looking for a sort of elasticy texture just dropping off the spoon nice flour the board take the dough out lovely lightly sprinkle touch more flour and just pull it over and push in every time you're sort of turning it almost like you're turning the dough into itself the dough should just sort of relax it shouldn't be sticking to your fingers now it's just nice and pliable set that in a nice clean bowl a little sprinkling a flour in there so as it starts to rise it doesn't stick cover that with some film leave the dough to rise in a warm place for 60 to 90 minutes until it's doubled in size this stage is called proving now whilst that's proving get a panel for the chocolate filling or ganache pour 500 ml of double cream into a saucepan and add honey [Music] bring the mixture to a gentle boil [Music] traditionally we've always put jam in there but chocolate and donuts wow to die for add the cream i'll give that a good mix the butter elevates the ganache into a really nice shiny chocolate coat look at that whoa give it a really nice whisk the whistling gives it that aerated texture to the ganache you're just lightening the load a little bit nice chocolate filling done put it in the fridge to cool then it's time to gently roll out the dough just let it roll naturally a centimeter and a half in depth slice one two place them on to your tray and let them rise again once the donors have had 30 to 40 minutes to rise it's time to shallow fry them in a pan filled one third full with hot vegetable oil risen but look they're sort of like little pockets of air right here we go place these in nice and carefully four maximum if there's too many in the pan the oil will go cold and the donuts will come out soggy turn them over beautiful [Music] they're going to come out into some sugar mixed with some malt powder 50 50. how do you tell they're actually cooked in the center tap on top it should be hollow in and just sprinkle the malt and the sugar shake off the excess i get so excited every time i make donuts now look at those beauties these are delicious eating as they are but the ganache is gonna be the icing on the cake piping bag peel the bag over your hand don't forget to pop the nozzle in i want the texture almost like a little liquid inside so i'm going to pipe them in a little bit warm hopefully you've got that burst of magic operation donut lift up the donut squeeze push in and fill just to start seeing that chocolate coming out and sit that back down nice sit them on there they've got a little bit heavier and we all know why nice that one's got my name on it that is amazing [Music] slow cooking is one of the best weapons in the chef's arsenal not only is it easy it's also an incredible way to transform meat into mouth-wateringly melting dishes mastering the art of slow cooking is something every cook should learn first up my phenomenal slow cooked beef short ribs slow cooking is a brilliant way of getting lots of extra depth and intensity into your dishes the secret is to lock in all those flavors at the start and let the ingredients do their thing as it cooks these are beef short ribs and there's basically five to six bones across there and as the short rib cooks it sticks to that bone the bone implants flavor and the meat just sort of melts cooks slowly gives it that nice level intensity slice alongside the bone straight down you can see that marbling that sort of disappears and disintegrates i'm cooking them in a roasting tray get it on the heat until nice and hot season these short ribs beautifully olive oil in bone on the top we'll start coloring that in really important to give the beef short rib a really nice sear if you didn't brown the meat off it goes in the oven and it looks like boiled meat so you really want that nice dark rich coloring just cut the garlic in half slide that down the side that's going to give that beef an amazing flavor [Music] to give body to the sauce stir in a heaped teaspoon of tomato puree i'm just hitting the bottom of the pan with that tomato puree and we call it cooking out that smell of puree otherwise it just goes in there raw and it gives this sort of tartness to the braised short ribs red wine in don't use an expensive bottle of red wine there's no need bring the wine up to the boil and reduce it this burns off the alcohol and concentrates the flavor it makes a big difference when you reduce the red wine down by half because it gives that nice dark rich intensity look at my garlic that is just gonna sweeten everything up incredible stock in beef stock perfect chicken stock fine just to about an inch underneath the beef short ribs bring it up to the ball to lock in all that flavor as the beef ribs slow cook cover them so they braise from the bottom and steam from the top into the oven two and a half hours 170 to 180 degrees she goes the great thing about slow cooking is you do most of the work in advance and then put your feet up five or ten minutes before the beef short ribs come out of the oven start your garnish this is light cured pancetta i want nice thick lardons nice big thick sticks of crispy bacon [Music] these are delicious chestnut mushrooms i'm not gonna slice them i'm just going to cut them in half but look at the color on those lardons now all the whites raw fat have disappeared the lardons have shrunk right down and all we've got there now is the proper bacon mushrooms in beautiful so the mushrooms get seasoned from the bacon i'm pan frying these separately to the beef so they remain crisp and have a different texture [Music] leave that to cool down now this is like christmas day for me when you unwrap that fall wait you see what's underneath it [Music] wow they smell incredible lift and place on the tray beautiful to make a fantastic rich deep sauce press the soft roasted garlic through a sieve into the cooking juices all that nice pureed garlic coming through there because that is going to make the most amazing flavor scrape all of that off the sieve nice then just start sieving all that lovely braising liquor wow in that smells delicious take your sauce and just glaze do them individually they deserve that respect spoon on your bacon and your mushrooms [Music] beautiful be generous with these mushrooms i'm telling you they taste amazing flat leaf parsley all that freshness over those amazing ribs incredible never ever be embarrassed about going to your butcher and asking for cheap cuts because the results are incredible amazing beef braised short ribs with bacon and mushrooms

#GordonRamsay #Cooking #Food #BBQ

Pre-order...",2022-12-01 22:16:02.926159, if you want a new twist on a favorite dish spice it up with chili my next recipe is super simple to make but has wonderful depth and complexity of flavors spicy beef salad chilis if you use them confidently they can really add a new dimension to the style of cooking but the real trick is finding that balance of flavors that really suits you because that's the most important part so this is the most amazing sirloin you can see it's got that wonderful marble for me the secret behind this is cooking it quickly season the steaks generously salt and pepper push that seasoning in to the sirloin take the sirloin out the fridge literally 20 minutes before you want to cook them so it gets up to room temperature they cook more evenly but more importantly you can actually season right inside the steak this little bit of fat down here season that as well because that is what we want to roast and get that really nice and rendered olive oil in a tablespoon roll that round as it starts to smoke in with the steaks into the pan and lay away again into the pan and lay away if you don't hear that noise the minute those steaks hit the pan don't put them in so the secret now is getting that color on the steak turning it once and once only and cooking it for two and a half minutes each side what i want to do is to get that bit of fat rendered so it adds a lot more flavor just hold the steak down like that and that starts to melt the fat which makes it so much more tender there should be no white fat left anywhere turn them over really important to have that steak up to room temperature before you start cooking it so the inside is nice and warm so we spend less time in the pan and more time cooling down really important now two fingers touch it goes in it says rare i'm happy for them to be rare because by the time i let them rest they're going to go back to medium rare it'll continue cooking out onto a plate and let them rest one to just get my juices over don't waste that really important next the spicy dressing take the seeds out of the chili to reduce the heat by rubbing it in your hands and tapping until the seeds fall out cut it in half and just chop it in garlic and chilli works brilliantly a quick way of peeling it get your knife and just slam it down pops out very very quickly in a little touch of salt rub start going around in circles first you'll see it puring nice clear that off now we've got the heat in there from the chilli and that richness from the garlic two teaspoons of palm sugar this is where it starts to have that nice sweet sour effect fish sauce fresh lime this is a simple fresh chili dressing and it was something i fell in love with in vietnam and cambodia because it was just so easy give that a little mix and dissolve the sugar quick taste wow right vegetables a great fuss-free way to get super thin ribbons of carrot is to use a veg peeler when they're that thin they take the vinaigrette so much better and radishes just slice them down at an angle lovely to give another dimension to the salad i'm gonna use a banana shallot they are incredibly mellow very sweet across just chop up the shallot and mix that through want some sweetness in there now little vine tomatoes slice them in half smarter's in shallot radish carrots and tomatoes next peel and slice cucumber chopped spring onions and shred baby gem lettuce and then finally get some fresh mint it's young men so you don't need to take all those stalks off all you do is hold the bunch upside down and then take it for a little trim and just chop that once through look at that nice minted salad a couple of tablespoons of dressing don't flood the salad with a dressing you can always add but we can't take it away now really mix that dressing in there make sure all that chili and garlic and palm sugar wraps around that salad beautiful onto the plate the steak's rested it's now nice and medium rare that little bit of fat we don't want to find that in the salad just slice that off that serves its purpose it's kept that steak nice and moist just slice going with the grain it's almost like slicing through butter and look inside beautiful pink you slice the beef too thinly then it goes stone cold and more importantly all the goodness runs out of it nice thick slices get the beef and start placing it around the salad take a little teaspoon of your dressing the rest of your salad sip that on top and finish it off with some toasted peanuts peanuts in now those nuts are really toasted nuts on get another pan and just crush once they've cooled down just run them through with a knife you can hear how crunchy they are another texture another taste the salad and then from there sprinkle and then finally take that just finish it with a little tablespoon of that sauce and there is one tasty very well textured spicy beef salad [Music] cooking dishes in advance is a brilliant way of taking the stress out of cooking at home and many dishes just get better and better with time first up my amazing sticky pork ribs one of the secrets to great cooking is patience leaving dishes to marinade for one or two days helps to develop the flavor in your food and the end result so much more delicious it's a method i use in the restaurants all the time first off get your roasting tray put the tray on the gas pork ribs 60 meat and 35 40 fat give them a really good season salt and pepper nice thing about this cut they stay incredibly moist when they're on the bone and the longer you cook them the more delicious they become and just push all that seasoning in to the pork olive oil in make sure that tray is nice and hot and i really want that nice sort of caramelization taking place on the pork that's the nice thing about starting it on top of the stove use your roasting tray get them colored and then the oven putting the ribs straight in the oven you don't get the color it looks sort of boiled as opposed to a nice caramelized rib ginger you can't beat fresh ginger with sticky pork ribs place it down nice and firmly and slice the thinner you slice the ginger the more fragrant the ribs garlic and it's really important before you add anything those ribs make sure you've got the color from the ribs first don't rush it turn them over that's what i want that nice crispy color as they sort of braise in the oven all that color just turns into the most amazing flavor braising is just a chef's turn for cooking something slowly in liquid right ginger and garlic in spread it around on all those ribs to sort of roast the ginger and the garlic chili flakes chili flakes in next szechuan pepper citrusy vibrant peppercorns incredible in next star anise that gives it a really nice sort of aniseedy flavor almost like you're roasting the ribs in fennel and now we've got the heat got the spice i want to sweeten things up a little bit some fresh honey honey glazes the pork beautifully counteracts against all that spice in there but look what's happening a color on the ribs is extraordinary it's like a really nice chili sweet caramel now soy sauce brings that little bit of sort of saltiness to it really generous with the soy sauce japanese vinegar two tablespoons of vinegar in rice wine it gives it that nice sort of um tartness to the ribs if you can't find rice wine our dry sherry's a great substitute 300 mil that takes out the heat of that sichuan pepper those dry chili flakes make sure they're all laid down like a nice tight box of matches bring that up to the boil cooking is all about learning to develop your own likes and dislikes so always keep tasting to make sure you're happy with the combination of flavors it's lacking a little touch of vinegar what that sharpness now think what's going on the tartness the heat the caramel the colour on the ribs is amazing i want a bit of a sort of oniony flavor put some spring onions in whilst these ribs are in the oven the spring onions will sort of puree they give a sharpness the final taste of that pork in with my spring onions and with my stock 400 ml of stock this is just a simple chicken stock the stock just sits underneath the ribs it absorbs into the rib and the top of the rib glazes underneath the rib that gets crispy and rich and that's what makes the ribs nice and moist really important into the oven cook at 180 for 30 minutes then turn the ribs over and cook for a further 30 minutes [Music] now wow they smell incredible each side has got that really nice crispy roasted edge becomes sticky and chewy and sweet sour the fats disappeared and the pork just melts in your mouth i want to take them to the next level gas back on now shake the tray and this is the sort of the way that we finish them in the restaurant every minute they glaze in that tray they just get to taste better and better now look at them i'm so happy with those ribs done absolutely delicious now but if you want you can put them in the fridge and the flavor will keep developing then just reheat them when you want to serve so [Music] each rib has a nice slice of ginger on there wow look at that delicious sticky ribs with an amazing marinade [Music] there's a wealth of classic fast food dishes we know and love from hot dogs and kebabs to tacos and burgers but the great thing about making them at home is you can throw away the rule book and get creative my next easy recipe is a miniature version of an american favorite the burger smoky pork sliders with barbecue sauce everyone loves a burger they're a true fast food original and that's the exciting thing about street food you can take an old classic like that and reinvent it into something really exciting when you think of a burger what you need is a great sauce and unlike smoky barbecue it goes hand in glove with a great burger start by finely chopping one onion and three cloves of garlic nice hot pan tablespoon of olive oil onions and garlic into the pan nice seasoning salt and pepper now the secret of a good barbecue sauce is that really important caramelization to begin with a nice tablespoon of brown sugar it darkens the onions but it really starts to sort of give that nice syrupy body to the sauce and put a little bit of heat in there now a nice teaspoon of smoked paprika that's the important part of working with spices you've got to cook them out and almost sort of burn off that rawness especially with a smoked paprika that's exactly where i want it to go onions and garlic beauty caramelized cider vinegar in reduce that down now i've got a fantastic smoky base to complete the sauce i'm making my life really easy and adding pre-made worcester sauce and tomato ketchup cook that out for two to three minutes now depending on how thick you like the barbecue sauce that determines how long you cook it out for i don't want it to be too runny but i don't want it too thick either that's the consistency we're looking for lovely turn down the gas charger seasoning now take that out it's the kind of sauce that i like to have sort of bottled up in the fridge it's great for sandwiches but goes brilliantly well with these sliders homemade smoky barbecue sauce give the pan a little wipe now start the mix for the sliders to give my mix a really interesting flavor and texture i'm gonna be using unsmoked back bacon i travel all over the world and i spend a lot of time in the states they know how to make a great slider pork sliders beef sliders chicken sliders and it's almost like a way of having a burger but on a much smaller miniature level little teaspoon of olive oil i want that bacon to get really nice and crispy bacon in this just gives the really nice sort of chunky delicious mix i want texture and pork is perfect for slider [Music] and choppy shallot shallots are a lot sweeter than your normal white onion fine fine fine and then [Music] now that bacon's getting really nice and crispy i want a bit of heat in there a little teaspoon of smoked paprika in there when you see these sliders in the states for one portion there's like four or five of them little mini one biters incredible now take your pork just open up and give that a really nice seasoning so important you can't season a slider after you've cooked it it's impossible so season it nicely bake now that's nice and crispy just take a little touch kitchen roll and just drain that off there nice pat that nice and dry i want all that nice sort of crispiness in there beautiful mix all that in take a nice ball and sort of roll it the size of a golf ball get it nice and round first and then three fingers just pat that down don't flatten them too thin otherwise they overcook and they go sort of dry because sliders are bite-sized burgers designed to go in small buns you don't want to make them too big good get the pan nice and hot a tablespoon of olive oil when a slider is literally that thick about an inch thick we're going to take two and a half to three minutes to each side in turn them over lovely once you've turned them tilt the pan and just spoon all that juice back into them keep my mouth watering now very easy to dry the pork out so just feeling it now your fingers is nice and firm it's a little touch of springiness in the center i'm happy with those add your cheese now so it gets nicely melted i'm using wedgies of smoked cheddar and it has that nice sort of soury smoky creaminess to the slider finally shredded baby gem lettuce just take those buns make sure they're sliced nice and evenly take your lettuce be quite generous with the lettuce just a nice thin slice of tomato take your burgers you see that cheese you feed melted your bbq sauce place the top on and that is my version the slider that is small dynamic but packed full of flavor i'll take that over a hamburger any day you

the house with fantastic aromas and puts irresistible food on the table now i'm gonna put you on the road to bacon nirvana starting with an easy bread packed with big gutsy flavors olive tomato and rosemary for catcher i absolutely love bacon bread there's something really satisfying about doing it and this focaccia recipe is very hands-on but the end result is something really really tasty first off start with the dough tip 500 grams of strong bread flour into a mixing bowl and add 20 grams of semolina that gives the vacation it's sort of rustic charm now there's one thing for catcher needs it's really good seasoning you can't season bread after it's baked so it's got to go in right at the very beginning sprinkling 15 grams of dried yeast take some warm water and then 50 mils of olive oil top of that water that gives it this really nice silky rich texture make a little well mix up that yeast water and oil in start off with your fingers keep your fingers nice and open it's like a little sort of whisk going in there i'm looking for a really nice sort of relaxed dough now that's just starting to come together touch more water with oil in there give a little swirl and then again the secret is to sort of knead it gently don't overwork it it's a sort of easy bread to make a nice one to start off with when you're making bread for the first time basically kneading means just knit it together just hanging lightly flour your board and let's just knead that for catcher into a nice smooth dough make sure you don't over add too much flour otherwise it sort of dries out the dough something quite magical about making bread you can switch off and lose yourself my first job for a three-mission style establishment was a baker i was 22 years of age and to start at midnight i was under such a tight schedule one o'clock white bread then two o'clock brown bread three o'clock sourdough four o'clock cheese bread five o'clock proof bake six o'clock crack them open and taste it was amazing beautiful yeah looks stunning it hasn't even risen yet leave your dough to rise in a warm place until it's doubled in size we call this proving [Music] that beautiful a lot of chefs sort of need it for the second time but i'm looking for a really nice light aerated for catcher take your tray a touch of olive oil in there season it at the bottom really important that's the exciting thing about focaccia you've got that really nice sort of salty top and salty bottom and just with a touch of olive oil on your hands gently push that in and almost massage it into the corners it's possible to put sort of olives and tomatoes and garlic through the dough but it never really allows the dough to sort of aerate properly when you put so much ingredients in i'm gonna stick mine on top use your finger and sort of just push them in salt on top some pepper on top as well i want some nice fresh amazing rosemary just hold the stalk and just pull off and then just sprinkle down generous in the rosemary really important to have that nice fragrance on top of the fuckacha finish it off before it goes in with a little drizzle of olive oil so it almost sinks in those little pockets of flavor olive tomato rosemary and olive oil into the oven bake your focaccia at 200 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes [Music] smells delicious beautiful [Music] you can hear how crispy that is

obsessed [Music] at his mill which has stood in norfolk since 1835 mark uses traditional stones to grind his flower so he really knows his stuff [Music] what actually comes off the field is something like this still husked still needs to be processed before we can actually mill it we then clean down to something like this which is ready to be milled [Music] all this is a great big machine which means you don't have to do it by hand rather than try and improve its performance by adding additional chemicals what we're trying to do is mill it in the best way to get that performance from it [Music] if you can put a seed in between stones you can make flour out of it uh it's that simple barley was what was traditionally used to make bread for people to live off oats can be used as well and of course good old spelt the great grandmother of modern wheats which has the most fantastic flavor and is because of its primitive nature the proteins in it are simpler so a lot of people can eat that they can't eat modern weight keep your eyes on the shelves look and see what is there and if something strikes you as being potentially interesting then get it and try it mix your own blend your own together so that you can get the flavour that you want with the performance that you want [Music] mark's right different flowers performance tastes wildly different and so they're well worth trying out here's my quick guide to some of the flowers i like using strong flour is one to choose for standard bread making the higher the protein content the crust your loaf will be the flour hailing from italy double zero it's super finely milled and perfect for pasta i like to use it for pizzas too because it produces a nice crispy crust like the one on my mozzarella and rosemary version rye flour will give you really dense fruity flavored bread fruit cakes or scones if it's too heavy for you just mix it with standard wheat flour and when you are baking remember that self-raising flour is just plain flour with raisin asians added so if you run out you can add baking powder and salt to your plain flour and get baking [Music] that's the real stuff that's it fresh flour straight out the mill is so superior in flavor and performance that is only when you come to use it you realize what the difference is if you're going to experiment with ingredients in baking you still need to follow some basic rules to make sure things turn out brilliantly every time then whether you're a master baker or you're just starting out you can pimp up the classics whether it's a victoria sponge or a fruit scone and that's the lesson perfectly illustrated by my next recipe sponge with fresh ginger bacon is part chemistry part imagination but you've got to rely on the rules for great results it's the only time you'll see me reaching for the scales first off eggs sugar butter and when i say weigh out the ingredients it does literally mean way out to the final gram 175 now 175 grams of sugar that's 350 grams in total cream the butter and the sugar to get a delicious light sponge start carefully on slow speed [Music] only speed up as the butter and sugar really start to cream together keep that really nice and light you can see how it's changed color so important at the beginning eggs in give a little whisk adding one egg at a time stops the mix from separating second again third one in [Music] that's what we're looking for a really nice sort of light airaidy texture now gonna flavor the sponge a little teaspoon of vanilla extract that perfumes the mix one teaspoon of baking powder that gives lightness 175 grams of flour and we're gonna sieve it a to get rid of any lumps and b to keep it really nice and fine 175. we're not gonna beat that out we're just gonna lightly fold that in now what i'm looking for is a really nice loose dough that's looking a little bit too firm so just a little splash of milk a couple of tablespoons that relaxes the mixture down helps create that nice almost dropping consistency that's what i want just starting to drop take a non-stick loose bottom cake tin grease it with butter then coat it with flour to avoid the sponge sticking just give that a little shake make sure you get all the rim now just get the back of the spatula make sure you've got no peaks on my sponge to make sure the sponge bakes nice and evenly tap the tin a few times to knock out any air pockets that might have formed in the mixture now into the oven bake for 30 to 35 minutes at 180 degrees as that's cooking prepare the ginger cream for the center 300ml of cream give that a nice whisk whisking cream by hand gives you so much more control and it's so easy to over whip cream i want that nice light ginger cream in the center i don't want it grainy nothing worse when cream starts to separate now let's get into that three-quarter stage little stiff peaks stop that for two minutes fresh ginger now get a really nice large slice of ginger smells incredible it's so fragrant eating ginger is like sort of peeling a potato just take out all those little dark spots now get your grater you haven't got a grater you can chop the ginger really finely have gone almost like a puree of ginger going through but the juice as well take your knife and just scrape all that taste incredible it's fragrant and it's not sweet it's got a really nice taste set that in the fridge [Music] smells incredible run a knife around the outside to ensure the cake doesn't stick to the tin before turning it out now get your hands under push up and out while your cake cools i'm gonna do like a really nice sweet chocolate coating pour 300 mils of double cream into a saucepan add two tablespoons of golden syrup to make the top nice and glossy then whisk chop this up really thinly so as it melts quickly 50 grams of butter that's gonna give the chocolate a really nice shine ball your cream and mix it in give that a really good stir as the chocolate the butter melts it thickens like how shiny that is so nice to finish something sweet on top topping done time to build your sponge cake look at the halfway mark there and just gently slice and really take your time all the way through lift that's delicious that nice big dollop in the middle don't be stingy don't be tight with a cream another dollop on top spread that very carefully lift the lid and just sit there on top that's why i start off with a little extra cream in there so when i squash it down the cream just pushes out to the side i'm not finished pour the luxurious chocolate topping over the sponge be generous and make sure the cake is coated thoroughly to give it a gorgeous finish get the bottom of the ladle and spread whoa one more [Music] wow you've got to know when to say stop and something looks that delicious i just want to dive in there [Music] next five more my 100 tips to help you cook better and of course these are all about bacon kicking off with how to whip cream whipping cream now the important part here is whipping the cream to a three-quarter stage if we over whip it it will split so be very careful double cream in now when we whisk things we whisk it in the shape of a figure of eight and if you spin the bowl as you whip the cream you get to release it from the bottom so it whips evenly whisk whisk whisk and it should just sit inside the whisk and start to sort of fall out just perfect three-quarter stage double cream done room temperature cream whips much faster than cold so you'll need to take your cream out of the fridge 30 minutes before you want to whip it unless of course you want to work on your biceps a great tip to prevent milk and cream from boiling over in a saucepan is to simply lay a wooden spoon across the top the cream bubbles will rise up and hit the wooden handle and then fall back into the pan instead of bubbling over sticky stuff like trinkle and golden syrup can be a real mess to measure out my tip is to rub the spoon with a neutral oil like rave seed and any sticky ingredients will slide straight off [Music] and my tip for greasing cake tins is to keep old butter wrappers on hand and use them to crease when needed [Music] follow my ultimate cookery course packed with key lessons top tips and 100 recipes to stay your life on and you'll literally be cooking yourself into a better chef many of these amazing recipes are on my app please check out the app store for details go on get cooking okay this time i'm gonna help you achieve better bacon the great thing about pastry is if you follow the basic rules the possibilities are endless whether it's simple short crust or flaky filo you just need a bit of practice to get it right my first recipe uses lovely buttery shortcuts pastry to make a dish that's as delicious as it is simple leek and pancetta quiche shortcuts pastry is one of the staples of the kitchen it is so versatile but the good news is it's one of the easiest pastries to make trust me when you crack it it can make a real difference to your cooking take a sieve when you think of short crust pastry it's sort of semi-flaky but it's rich buttery start by sipping 200 grams of plain flour into a mixing bowl large pinch of salt 200 grams of unsalted butter bring the butter up to room temperature if you let the butter become too soft then the flour so it doesn't absorb it in with your fingers rub together first now the secret is grab big handfuls and squeeze the butter into the flour so look what's happened literally in 30 seconds i've got that nice crumbly texture now a couple of tablespoons of water nothing worse when the pastry is so wet you can't bring it together it needs to shape like a nice rich cookie dough it's just a touch too dry so one more tablespoon of water [Music] and there you go it's coming nicely now that's what i want a nice sort of firm ball of pastry onto the board i'm gonna use these one of the strongest parts of the body pull towards you and push back down use those wrists to really knead it together so just that nice sort of smooth texture now wrap it in clin film set there in the fridge for 20 minutes really important that you let the shortcuts pastry relax [Music] now to make the quiche you can use just an ordinary flan dish but i love making them in many frying pans which give them an extra rustic charm brush with oil to stop the pastry from sticking once the pastry is at room temperature roll it out to a nice even thickness place it in the center of your little pan turn it in don't use your fingers because what we don't want is any holes in this just get a little bit of dough because that sort of acts like a little sort of mallet flattens it out nicely i'm building a sort of extra lip because that way i can get the filling it's absolute maximum levels we're going to cook them blind first to blind bake simply means to pre-cook your pastry before adding the filling this ensures you'll have a fantastic crisp pastry add a sheet of foil or baking paper and weigh it down you can use rice pulses or ceramic baking stones just make sure you keep them for the next time in the oven 200 degrees for 10 minutes now for the filling i'm gonna do a classic quiche bacon and leeks this is a amazing cured pancetta pancetta is an italian cured meat made from belly pork seasoning with things like juniper nutmeg fennel a great substitute is unsmoked bacon as the manchetta gets lovely and crispy finely slice leeks and add oh leeks and bacon nice really important to cook those leeks down it's exactly what i want those leeks are almost sort of caramelized slightly crispy the flavor is amazing and just drain them off so any excess fat gets drained a couple of tablespoons of cream it gives it a really nice richness i want two-thirds garnish i.e bacon and leeks in my quiche and one-third of the savory custard a touch of salt touch a pepper and i grate some gruyere cheese that makes a really nice sort of creamy less of an eggy quiche take my amazing crispy pancetta and leeks in give that a good mix needs one more little thing some freshness flat leaf parsley incredible really important just to taste the mixture with the quiche filling ready next finish off the pastry [Music] remove the fall and weight and return to the oven to get it lovely and golden all over [Music] now when we fill them give that a really good mix up [Music] beautiful grate over some more cheese which will bubble up and melt beautifully and then into the oven bake your quiche for 15 to 20 minutes [Music] incredible it's got that nice sort of cheese and toast smell from the top it's sort of baked but the secret of any good quiche is in the short crust because that's the hero there are lots of different types of pastry so to help you put you on the road to pace your perfection here are three of my simple pastel recipes that you can easily cook at home first up my indulgent chocolate tarts [Music] first combine softened butter and sugar and cream until soft [Music] break in an egg and mix well next fold in the flour [Music] pour the mixture onto a floured surface and simply knead it lightly till it's well combined then shape into a disc and chill then simply roll out your pastry until it's about a quarter of a centimetre thick cut into small discs then gently press into lightly greased loose bottom mini tart tins and prick the bottom to prevent the pastry from bubbling rest in the fridge this ensures that when the pastry bakes it will turn out nice and soft then bake it till golden as they cool make the gorgeous silky chocolate filling place a mixing bowl over a pan of gently boiling water this is known as a bain-marie then add double cream butter and plain chocolate then stir until it melts and it is glossy and smooth then pour it into the crisp and golden pastry cases and simply tap to level and chill until set so easy so indulgent and so delicious eat them with creme fraiche ice cream or simply by themselves perfect my next dish is an irresistible take on a latin american classic beef empanadas first finely chop onion and garlic sweat in a pan of hot olive oil until tender add paprika cinnamon and cumin and stir cooking the spices off intensifies the flavor add beef mince to the pan brown and season add chili flakes for a fiery kick next dried oregano chopped green olives and chopped boiled eggs once it's mixed through set aside to cool for the empanada cases roll out puff pastry this stuff's so time consuming to make at home so do what i do cheat and use shop bought cut into disks spoon the mixture into one half of the disk leaving roughly a centimeter border around the edge brush the edge of one half of the disc with egg and fold it over crimp the edges with your fingers to seal and remove air pockets then simply cook in a medium oven until golden brown super easy super quick and super tasty serve a chimichurri a spicy south american herb salsa this is what cornish pasties dream of being when they grow up my next dish uses super fine filler pastry and his variation on a moroccan classic easy chicken pastilla first chop onions ginger then fry them in hot olive oil add cinnamon and to give the mix a subtle sweet note a pinch of sugar then season chop cook chicken thighs and add to the mix pour in chicken stock and then simmer stir and hold lightly beaten eggs which thicken the sauce and cook add in sliced almonds then set aside to cool [Music] now build your pastilla filo is another pastry that's tricky to make at home but you can buy fantastic filo so cheat brush each sheet with melted butter and lay four sheets into a greased baking tin [Music] spoon in half of the fantastic aromatic chicken filling add four more butter sheets of filo pastry and simply pile in the rest of the delicious chicken finally cover with a couple of sheets of filo and fold over all the draped sides brush with more butter then bake in a hot oven for 10 to 15 minutes until the top is crispy and golden brown you want all the filler paste wonderfully crunchy and golden so turn over and return for another 10 minutes when done removed and for a different but delicious sweet finishing touch dust lightly with icing sugar and cinnamon intensely aromatic sweet and savory crispy and succulent an extraordinary pie that has to be tasted to be believed [Music] three types of pastry three mouthwatering fillings three more recipes you can stake your life on and so simple to do beautiful for easy accurate baking you need the right kit you don't need to spend a fortune on masses of kitchen equipment here's my quick guide to two essentials you need for baking scales and a sieve bacon is so popular now these scales are absolutely essential especially when you have to follow the recipe to the exact grammar these digital scales are so easy to follow they can convert from pounds and ounces to kilos and grams and more importantly so much easier to use than your mum's old weight absolutely perfect a sieve make sure you get one with a long handle and balancing hooks so you can rest it over your mixing bowl or a pan easy thing to have in the drawer costs nothing but it's so effective especially with bacon with these two pieces of kit definitely on the right road to baking like a pro [Music] welcome back to my ultimate cookery course next on my guide to better bacon i'll be teaching you how to make a stylishly simple and sumptuous cheesecake peaceful but first be it bacon or any type of cooking always pays off to use the best ingredients you can find and you're never too old to learn from the experts [Music] next my shopping guide to get the best milk and cream when it comes to knowing what makes great quality milk dairy farmer charlie ray is your man he's been producing milk from he's heard of handmade specialist breed jersey cattle for over 30 years [Music] yeah they're part of the family almost so he's up to his wellies in the stuff jersey milk is very high butter fat which therefore means it is very creamy very creamy to drink and it's the best quality milk you'll get anywhere jersey cows very docile very friendly very easy to manage and this is my favorite um she's about 17 years old she's called misty if you think of the large arctic milk tank as you see going up and down the motorways she's filled one and a half of those on her own [Music] i reckon these are happy cows they've got a dry roof over their heads they've got a dry bed and they've got as much food as they want the happier they are and the better kept they are the better the quality of the milk that comes out the other end [Music] this is what's called an abreast milking parlour one down the other way and it suits us in as much as we've got contact with the cows we can treat each cow individually the milk goes up through a meat up into that line through a big filter and into the tank well there you are without this product you wouldn't have chocolate cheese yogurts it's the base ingredient in so many things that you buy and totally take for granted and where there's milk there's also glorious cream essential for brilliant bacon and lots of savory dishes too [Music] single cream is around 18 fat so it's a lighter option for topping desserts or stirring into savory sauces whereas double cream at nearly 50 fat is lovely and rich in panna cottas or in a carbonara source as well as being able to withstand boiling whipping and freezing sour cream salad with a similar culture to that used in yogurt is a really tasty topping for chilies or baked potatoes clotted cream rich thick and a delicious indulgence served with puddings and scones or an ice cream to make it extra rich and mascarpone actually a creamy soft italian cheese famously used in italian dessert tiramisu it's also fantastic in cheesecakes [Music] it is font of all life in great bacon as with all cooking sometimes less is more the easiest dishes look and taste spectacular when they're done well and it doesn't come any simpler or more stylish than my next dish wonderful baked cheesecake for me food always has to be impressive but when it comes to desserts often you see spun sugar or wild decorations remember simple is always the most impressive this cheesecake is so straightforward yet so delicious now cream cheese leave it out the fridge for five or ten minutes go nice and soft trust me your arms will be thanking you sugar in this cheesecake is the new york cheesecake because it's baked so there's no base start creaming the cheese and the sugar spending the amount of time i do in the states if there's one thing they know how to do out there is the most amazing impressive cheesecake rich delicious but so simple work the bowl lift the ball to your advantage really whisk whisk whisk whisk lovely nice and creamy now get your eggs add the extra mixture bit by bit doing it this way it's more efficient hey you're incorporating a lot of air b the mixture doesn't separate lastly your egg lovely of course you can use electric mixer but why go to the gym we can just make a cheesecake a day a cheesecake a day keep the bingo wings away now a couple of tablespoons of flour give it a whisk stop something going lumpy now i want to scent that cheesecake i've got the freshness zest of the lemon in there i want to sort of tart it up even more fold in some fresh raspberries so just mix them through be careful to crush them then grease the cake in with butter this will ensure your cheesecake slides out beautifully get your mix let that fall in now take your cake tin and just tap it mixture hits the bottom of the cake tin the raspberries rise and you've got raspberries at the top the middle and the bottom it also stops all these little pockets of air trapping underneath the mixture in the cake tin there's no holes in the cheesecake now into the oven 180 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes [Music] slightly souffled up pull off [Music] that's the color i wanted on top and look at it it's one of the simplest yet the most stylish cheesecakes anywhere beautiful [Music] next my tricks to the trade and kitchen tips kicking off with how to handle pastry lightly flour the surface pastry on top rolling pin now the secret now is don't overwork the pastry firm push turn the pastry round and this helps to even the pastry turn and roll now as it starts to crack don't worry just by pushing it back together it sort of unites the pastry immediately apply pressure turn the pastry now the average thickness is down to a one pound coin back on to the rolling pin and look beautiful for the neatest edge on tarts and quiches my tip is to let the pastry hang over the side of the tin when you bake it trim around the edge once the pastry is cooked it will give you a cleaner edge and prevent it from shrinking [Music] my tip for even rising is to place cakes and tarts in the center of the oven so the air can circulate all the way around them to test your cake to make sure it's done insert a knife skewer or even a piece of spaghetti in the center if there's mixture stuck to it it's not done yet if it comes out clean your cake's ready [Music] if you don't have any baking beans to hand for blind baking you can use any rice grain or pulse you won't be able to cook with them afterwards but do keep them to reuse them next time when you're folding egg whites or whipped cream into cake mixtures you want to retain as much air in the mixture as you can my tip use a metal spoon as the sharp thin edge will keep more of the air in [Music] follow my ultimate cookery course

real fast food [Music] real fast food should always grab your attention with big gutsy flavors fantastic aromas and be immediately satisfying it should also be easy to make and quick to cook and real fast food doesn't get much faster than my first dish chicken stir fry with rice noodles some of the best street food i've ever eaten was in asia every one of those little markets was filled with smells of delicious food that all centered around an asian staple noodles learn to cook those properly and you'll be surprised how quick and easy it is to knock off a delicious dinner first off we're gonna soak our noodles now these are rice noodles into a bowl and just pour the hot water over the rice noodles soak and rehydrate 12 to 15 minutes to soften up if you've got a wok perfect if not just a normal size frying pan with big sloping sides pan on get it really nice and hot chicken breast very lean hardly any fat on there you've got this little fillet just slice that off now the secret to getting it really nice and thin and to cut it into strips take your knife keep it nice and flat on the board and sort of slice it in half like a sort of scallop like that we call this butterfly in the chicken take a rolling pin and nice and gently roll over the chicken what it does it sort of flattens it allows you to slice it even thinner and the thinner the slices of the chicken the sort of crispier it gets the quicker it cooks slice it in half just start slicing these nice thin slices and the good news is one chicken breast can serve two or three easily next wash your knife and finally slice garlic the thinner the garlic the crispier this is a young tender broccoli just slice them down i want a bite to the broccoli and normally you sort of paste the dish with one-third noodles one-third vegetables and one-third of your protein chicken with a dish that takes literally minutes to put together it's really important to get everything organized everything needs to be at your fingertips touch of olive oil get a pan really nice and ready just starting to smoke drop the chicken in first salt pepper open up those little strands of chicken nice once you've started to sear off the chicken get the garlic in now let that get really nice and crispy the way to do it is to sort of spread all the chicken the garlic up the side of the pan and see why it's so important to cut the chicken thin strips because it colors and cooks at the same time as well really really crucial now that garlic's getting really nice and crispy broccoli in feels strange putting raw broccoli in like that normally we'll blanch it in boiling water dry it out but you want that crunch now soy sauce that helps to season it but also stains beautifully soy sauce in lovely that's exactly what i want now

join the chicken for your favorite real fast food dishes open up the legs and just pierce the skin there careful not to cut into the breast and hand on top of the breast and pull the drum back pop out and then slice the knife straight across there's the thigh there's the drum get your thumb and feel the joint and with the weight of the knife just slices through now two beautiful thighs now a bit of a chef's tip halfway down the drum just slice through onto the bone and then from there scrape the tendons and then hand down nice and firm on top now i'll get this beautiful bone presentation as it cooks it cooks evenly now pull out the wing feel where the end of the joint is and just slice in there through a beautiful big whole delicious wing now this is the rolls-royce part two breasts that's the breast bone there place the chicken on the board and then just slice down on the back of the crown everyone always cuts around just tilt it upwards straight through that way we get straight to the center of the carcass and therefore there's no waste and look we end up taking off his plump chicken breasts nice two drums two thighs two wings two breasts of chicken and one amazing carcass for a stock and not an ounce of waste a great tip to stop your skewers burning when you're making kebabs is to soak them in water first or for skewers with added flavor strip your rosemary branches of their leaves and use instead [Music] for no fuss marinading my tip is to place fish or meat in a plastic storage bag while they marinate it's easy to store and there's less cleanup lime juice or lemon juice make great marinades my tip for getting maximum amount of juice from a lemon or lime is to roll it hard under your palm for a minute before juicing lemons are also useful for rice add a couple of drops of juice while you cook it to keep your grains looking nice white and bright this is my ultimate cookery course 100 recipes to stake your life on i'll be showing you how to make mouth-watering burgers with a difference pork is perfect for a slider but i want a little bite in there but first my guide to getting the best ingredients for your money whether i'm knocking out fast food or planning a feast i want my dishes to be the tastiest they can be and to do that i always start with the best ingredients i can get my shopping manta is very simple knowledge is crucial the more you know personally about where your ingredients are from and how they produce the better so ask lots of questions and learn [Applause] here's a quick rundown of the six most useful vinegars and what you can do with them all my great fast and easy dressings with the exception of malt vinegar use this for pickling or splashing on your fish and chips tangy red wine vinegar is great for marinades red meats and card liver white wine vinegar is good for sweet and sour recipes as well as butter sauces cherry vinegar nutty and virgin on the sweet side this perfect splash into gazpacho or team with sweet seasoned veg like asparagus or artichokes while cider vinegar tart and fruity is ideal for pickling fruit and for vegetable chutneys rice vinegar is an essential for chinese and japanese dishes and is lovely and mild in flavor balsamic vinegar widely considered as the king of vinegars is the one i use time and time again dark and syrupy its sweet and sharp taste is a great addition if you're frying juicy steaks or chops in marinades or on fresh sweet strawberries like fine wine the price reflects the time it's been matured anywhere between three and 25 years look out for the stamp to make sure you're getting the genuine article from italy's modern region you can pay up to 200 quid for just 100 mils of top quality balsamic vinegar like this one and if you do splash out on one of the fine types you'll have to taste it to believe it [Music] there's a wealth of classic fast food dishes we know and love from hot dogs and kebabs to tacos and burgers but the great thing about making them at home is you can throw away the rule book and get creative my next easy recipe is a miniature version of an american favorite the burger smoky pork sliders with barbecue sauce everyone loves a burger they're a true fast food original and that's the exciting thing about street food you can take an old classic like that and reinvent it into something really exciting when you think of a burger what you need is a great sauce an unlike smoky barbecue it goes hand in glove with a great burger start by finely chopping one onion and three cloves of garlic nice hot pan tablespoon of olive oil onions and garlic into the pan nice seasoning salt and pepper now the secret of a good barbecue sauce is that really important caramelization to begin with a nice tablespoon of brown sugar it darkens the onions but it really starts to sort of give that nice syrupy body to the sauce i'll put a little bit of heat in there now a nice teaspoon of smoked paprika that's the important part of working with spices you've got to cook them out and almost sort of burn off that rawness especially with a smoked paprika that's exactly where i want it to go onions and garlic beautifully caramelized cider vinegar in reduce that down now i've got a fantastic smoky base to complete the sauce i'm making my life really easy and adding pre-made worcester sauce and tomato ketchup cook that out for two to three minutes now depending on how thick you like the barbecue sauce that determines how long you cook it out for i don't want it to be too runny but i don't want it too thick either that's the consistency we're looking for lovely turn down the gas charger seasoning now take that out it's the kind of sauce that i like to have sort of bottled up in the fridge it's great for sandwiches but goes brilliantly well with these sliders homemade smoky barbecue sauce [Music] give the pan a little wipe now start the mix for the sliders to give my mix a really interesting flavor and texture i'm gonna be using unsmoked back bacon i travel all over the world and i spend a lot of time in the states they know how to make a great slider pork sliders beef sliders chicken sliders and it's almost like a way of having a burger but on a much smaller miniature level a little teaspoon of olive oil i want that bacon to get really nice and crispy bacon in this just gives the really nice sort of chunky delicious mix i want texture and pork is perfect for a slider [Music] and choppy shallots slots are a lot sweeter than your normal white onion fine fine fine and in [Music] now that bacon's getting really nice and crispy i want a bit of heat in there a little teaspoon of smoked paprika in there when you see these sliders in the states for one portion there's like four or five of them little mini one biters incredible now take your pork just open up and give that a really nice seasoning so important you can't season a slider after you've cooked it it's impossible so season it nicely bacon now that's nice and crispy just take a little touch kitchen roll and just drain that off there nice pat that nice and dry i want all that nice sort of crispiness in there beautiful mix all that in take a nice ball and sort of roll it size of a golf ball get it nice and round first and then three fingers just pat that down don't flatten them too thin otherwise they overcook and they go sort of dry because sliders are bite-sized burgers designed to go in small buns you don't want to make them too big good get the pan nice and hot a tablespoon of olive oil when a slider is literally that thick about an inch thick we're going to take two and a half to three minutes to each side in turn them over lovely once you've turned them tilt the pan and just spoon all that juice back into them keep my mouth watering now very easy to dry the pork out so just feeling it now with your fingers is nice and firm it's a little touch of springiness in the center i'm happy with those add your cheese now so it gets nicely melted i'm using wedgies of smoked cheddar and it has that nice sort of soury smoky creaminess to the slider finally shredded baby gem lettuce just take those buns make sure they're sliced nice and evenly take your lettuce be quite generous with the lettuce just a nice thin slice of tomato take your burgers you see that cheese if you've melted your barbecue sauce place the top on and that is my version of a slider that is small dynamic but packed full of flavor i'll take that over a hamburger any day follow my ultimate cookery course crammed with key

details go on get cooking welcome to my ultimate cookery course packed with quick cooking tips know-how and 100 recipes to take your life on right this is my guide to amazing home cooked street food classics [Music] street food gets its name because it's cooked and eaten on the streets from the hawker marcus in asia to the new york hot dog stands there are some great chefs out there serving seriously delicious food that you can eat on the go my first recipe is a special mix of fantastic flavors from around the world beef tacos with wasabi mayo the great thing about street food is anything goes the only rule is they've got to be really fast and really tasty now these tacos mix are mexican and japanese flavors into a delicious meaty mouthful first off get that pan really nice and hot these are sirloin steaks sear it in the pan with all that fat on i'll add flavor salt and pepper couple tablespoons of olive oil in pan nice and hot hold up the steak and lay it in always lay away give the pan a little shake and it stops the steak from sticking we're looking for color and if it sticks it's gonna burn [Music] while the steaks are cooking i can get on with my super quick marinade now two tablespoons of misood paste that's a fermented soybean that gives a really nice sort of rich sweetness tablespoon of sugar a couple of tablespoons rice wine that gives it a really nice vinegary kick a couple of tablespoons of olive oil salt and pepper i'm looking for a nice sort of thick rich marinade marinade done it's time to turn the steaks sort the pan and to give the steaks a little base all we're doing every time is just adding more and more flavor take your tongs and sort of lift the steak on its back and really melt all that fat down offer the gas take them out just take your knife see all that fat there just slice that off i don't want any of that now in to the marinade [Music] beautiful tacos are one of mexico's most popular street foods they've been made from beef pork chicken or fish and are loaded up with amazing sauces and spices now i want something sort of pickly cabbage these are um chinese cabbages slice it in half look at it really crisp and really tasty we're gonna slice that into quarters and then just shred it and take your time you think of cabbage here and you think of sort of braised overcooked cabbage nothing worse but at a taco you want freshness a little season of chili flakes they sort of discreetly give it a little bit of heat a little touch of rice wine vinegar if you haven't got that fresh lemon juice a small drop of toasted sesame seed oil give that a really good mix now i need something to sort of bring it together we take some wasabi paste very hot very spicy a sort of thumbnail size i'm gonna mix that with a couple of tablespoons of mayonnaise and give that a really good mix these are basic corn tortilla the trick is to sort of color them and then shape them actually place it on the gas ring use some tongs so it's not to burn yourself you can also toast your tacos in a frying pan from there i'm just gonna place it on the rolling pin literally 30 seconds as it cools down the great thing about serving tacos is people can fill them themselves just the way they want them cabbage just squeeze out wet marinade a nice rustic little mountain mayonnaise on wait you see how soft and delicious and almost sort of melting in the mouth texture we've got on this amazing sirloin it's look at that really nice sear around the outside it's just nice and pink in the middle start off with my crispy shell back of the spoon with the wasabi mayonnaise inside taco and just sprinkle that delicious pickled cabbage and then just start lining my tacker with three or four slices touch more on my spicy layer that is how i'd make the perfect taco [Music] when you want comfort food quick fast food classics always deliver here are three more of my street food favorites all super easy but still put the gourmet into grab-and-go this street food dish packs a wonderful indian influence subtly spiced chicken wrap grab a mortar and pestle to make a spicy marinade for the chicken crack open cardamom pods and add ground ginger coriander cinnamon grated nutmeg cloves of garlic fresh coriander lemon juice olive oil and season now pulverize to form a paste pour over the chicken thighs and leave to marinade for up to two hours to cook griddle on a high heat to get wonderfully charred meat [Music] once the chicken is cooked warm through tortilla wraps on the same griddle then simply slice your chicken and put your wrap together top with shredded cabbage chopped spring onion and your favorite chilli sauce ready in 20 minutes sticky succulent and utterly moorish spiced chicken wrap you'll find my next fast food classic all over america tasty chili dogs [Music] for super quick and easy beef chili add chopped onions to hot olive oil and cook until soft then add chopped garlic a teaspoon of cumin seeds and stir to release their lovely aromatic flavor next chili powder turn up the heat and break beef mince into the pan brown and season add tomato puree and cook through next i'd like a spicy worcestershire sauce chopped in tomatoes dried oregano add a sprinkle of sugar [Music] cook frankfurter or bratwurst sausages bung in a bun and simply top with a spicy beef chili [Music] easy and irresistible a dog worth crossing the street for my third street food inspired recipe is vietnamese style baguette with beef start slicing sirloin steak into strips then simply marinade in soy sauce the salty and runny honey the sweet and leaf up to two hours then thread your marinated beef strips onto skewers and pan fry in hot olive oil for the topping which adds a lovely sour contrast great carrot and simply leave to pickle in rice vinegar [Music] next make the easy dressing simply de-seed and chop a chili add caster sugar and lime juice add a glug of fish sauce slice a baguette when lovely and brown the marinaded steak skewers are done remove and add top with the pickled carrot add cool sliced cucumber drizzle over the spicy dressing and to finish it off add coriander leaves simple to make but complex in flavor absolutely delicious [Music] three stunning recipes from the streets to your home guaranteed to take food on the run to a whole new level and so simple to do [Music] you don't need to spend a fortune on masses of kitchen equipment here's my quick guide to another cooking essential frying pan for me one of my favorites why because it's so versatile whether you're searing the most amazing rack of lamb cooking duck breasts sauteing chicken or even a quick omelet or even find an egg all in one look for an oven-proof frying pan with a metal handle if you want to cook like pros by finishing off your dish in the oven or under a hot grill just don't forget when you take it out the handle will be hot if you can get a high quality non-stick one with a thick heavy base which will distribute the heat evenly brilliant welcome back to my ultimate cookery course next on my guide to street food i'll be whipping up an indulgent finger-licking treat that is amazing but first like any passionate chef i want the best ingredients i can find whether it's for savory or sweet dishes next up my guide to buying chocolate chocolate gives you such an instant hit it's well worth knowing about the good stuff and who better to ask than award-winning alchemist of the sweetest kind paul young even when i don't want to think about it i'm thinking about it his cutting-edge approach to chocolate making has won him accolades around the world so when you're not shopping the best way is to look at your chocolate bar look on the back and look at the percentage that gives you how much cocoa is in the bar and the more cocoa the more rich intoxicating flavor so the most exciting bit is tasting chocolate good quality fine chocolate should have that clean snap bite a piece off and crunch it in your teeth but stop chewing let it melt move it around the mouth and you'll find that by letting it melt even dark chocolate that you've had before that seems quite bitter won't be when you chew quickly it releases tannin it releases all the bitterness in the chocolate letting it melt it's smoother and richer and you get all the flavor and most excitingly is it releases something into the brain called dopamine which makes you feel good and that's how you get addicted to real chocolate chocolate is not just an addictive treat it's an amazing ingredient here's my take on which kind to use for what [Music] white chocolate with its sweet vanilla taste is perfect used as a dipping or pouring sauce with fresh fruit or frozen berries for a quick dessert creamy milk chocolate is great for family friendly puddings and treats like quick bake cakes or melt onto homemade crepes or waffles dark chocolate is rich and intense i like using 70 coco stuff use it for ice creams that really pack a punch 100 pure cocoa has a very powerful intense taste and only the real chocolate geeks eat it straight and remember chocolate isn't just for sweet dishes for the famous mexican molay sauce this is the one to grab is there anything better than chocolate they say sex but that's totally overrated chocolate is a key ingredient in my favorite sweet fast food dishes which at their best are always irresistible instant and utterly satisfying so when you want an indulgent chocolate hit my next recipe will be right up your alley malt chocolate donuts street food is all about satisfying your cravings these donuts are sweet sticky and absolutely delicious first off we're gonna make the dough now this dough takes a bit of time but it's really exciting i'm heating all of the milk with the sugar this yeast easy to get hold of now when you make fresh donuts you need fresh yeast adding some of the warm milk to the yeast will activate it which will help the dough to rise just half give that a quick whisk the sugar sugar's dissolved in the milk the fresh yeast disintegrates instantly set the yeast mixture to one side while it does its job to start the main dough mix i'm adding half the butter to the remaining milk that gives the dough a nice silkiness i want it light so melt the butter into the milk flour into a sieve that helps to make the dough nice and smooth and you know when you've got a smooth dough it sort of rises evenly add a pinch of salt and two egg yolks pour in the warm milk and melted butter don't start over mixing it when you over mix the dough of a doughnut it gets really tight you're not gonna let it ariel yeast in nice and warm i love that smell now i'm looking for a sort of elasticy texture just dropping off the spoon nice flour the board take the dough out lovely lightly sprinkle touch more flour and just pull it over and push in every time you're sort of turning it almost like you're turning the dough into itself the dough should just sort of relax it shouldn't be sticking to your fingers now it's just nice and pliable set that in a nice clean bowl a little sprinkling flour in there so as it starts to rise it doesn't stick cover that with some film leave the dough to rise in a warm place for 60 to 90 minutes until it's doubled in size this stage is called proving now whilst that's proving get a panel for the chocolate filling or ganache pour 500 mils of double cream into a saucepan and add honey [Music] bring the mixture to a gentle boil [Music] traditionally we always put jam in there but chocolate and donuts wow to die for add the cream i'll give that a good mix the butter elevates the ganache into a really nice shiny chocolate coat look at that whoa give it a really nice whisk the whistling gives it that aerated texture to the ganache you're just lightening the load a little bit nice chocolate filling done put it in the fridge to cool then it's time to gently roll out the dough just let it roll naturally about a centimetre and a half in depth slice one two place them on to your tray and let them rise again once the donors have had 30 to 40 minutes to rise it's time to shallow fry them in a pan filled one third full with hot vegetable oil risen but look they're sort of like little pockets of air right here we go place these in nice and carefully four maximum if there's too many in the pan the oil will go cold and the donuts will come out soggy turn them over beautiful [Music] they're gonna come out into some sugar mixed with some malt powder 50 50. how do you tell they're actually cooked in the center tap on top should be hollow in and just sprinkle the malt and the sugar shake off the excess i get so excited every time i make donuts now look at those beauties these are delicious eating as they are but the ganache is gonna be the icing on the cake piping bag peel the bag over your hand don't forget to pop the nozzle in i want the texture almost like a little liquid inside so i'm going gonna pipe them on a little bit warm hopefully with that burst of magic operation donut lift up the donut squeeze push in and fill just to start seeing that chocolate coming out and sit that back down nice sit them on there they've got a little bit heavier and we all know why nice that one's got my name on it that is amazing [Music] next my tricks of the trade and kitchen tips starting with how to do your steak the way you want it i want to cook my steak rare so by touching the steak i want the same feedback as it is on the inside of my thumb that's rare as it starts to cook it gets a lot firmer medium is there semi-firm with a slight resistance well done it's there rare a great tip for getting meat or fish to cook faster is to score it which allows the heat to penetrate quicker this also allows marinades to be absorbed more deeply for stain free tupperware coat it thinly with oil which acts as a barrier between plastic and food it's so easy to make your own chili sherry to use in quick stir-fries or sauces take 450 ml of dry sherry such as fino and using a funnel pour into a sterilised bottle add five whole thai chilies seal with a cork or lid and leave to infuse for a couple of weeks my tip for using any discarded chili seeds is plant them to grow yourself some new chili peppers plant in an egg shell or seedling trays start them indoors and move outside when they're ready follow my ultimate cookery course crammed with key lessons top tips and 100 recipes to stake your life on and you'll literally be cooking yourself into a better chef many of

incredibly delicious and really straightforward to do now season the water just a little touch of olive oil stops it from becoming too sticky i love polenta it's a cool meal made from ground dried maize the more coarse the longer it takes to cook but you can also buy instant polenta which is ready in under 10 minutes and always use this at home and then whisk that out as it cooks out it

really intensify their flavor olive oil on the bottom of the tray and drizzle extra virgin olive oil on top nip your tomatoes with your scissors if you didn't burst them before they went in the oven

sour flavor a pinch of sugar and balsamic vinegar this is a wonderful aged balsamic vinegar and then some thyme don't pick the time just trim it like you're having a little haircut nice the tomatoes

it is possible to make it but to be honest to try and stretch the pastry that thin and get it even it's an absolute nightmare life's too short to make it at home when you can buy amazing filo pastry so when working with it always get a nice damp cloth and just lay the damp cloth over it that keeps it nice and moist and it stops the filler pastry from actually drying out put a pan on to melt your butter it's the butter that gives the crispiness to the filo pastry if you're going to brush or coat filler pastry with butter and make sure that butter is nicely seasoned you take your first layer lay it onto the board nice brush that with your butter and the nice thing about filler pastry is that it can be used for savory and sweet these are going to have a fragrant savoury flavor with thyme black pepper and parmesan cheese so no need for salt lift up the corner and fold very quickly brush the ends and just nip those ends together non-stick pan on a little splash of olive oil fry the pastry for one to two minutes on each side so you want them to sort of puff up the secrets get them quickly you can smell that cheese in that time you're looking for them to become golden and crispy simple as that and then out smells delicious and as they sit and cool down instantly they become really nice and crispy the filler goes fantastically well with thick creamy greek yogurt and a drizzle of runny honey there's something quite sort of middle eastern about the herbs the yogurt and the honey and the sort of crispy textures of the filo pastry an alternative savory breakfast when you want

through his favourite stress-free recipes, including Sticky pork ribs, Moroccan lamb with sweet potato & raisins, Spicy chutney, Meatballs in fragrant coconut broth AND...",2022-11-30 22:16:02.926159, [Music] welcome to my ultimate cookery course packed with cooking tips information and 100 recipes to stake your life on right now it's all about making it easy [Music] making it easy for yourself in the kitchen means using the time you have effectively and the one thing that can really help you do that is your freezer [Music] my recipe for meatballs is so versatile it can be used to make a dozen amazing dishes one of my favorites is meatballs in fragrant coconut broth having a freezer of home-cooked delicious food ready to go can be a real life saver it means you never have to compromise on flavor these meatballs are delicious but more importantly they freeze so well first off get your pan on and start sweating off your onions and your garlic this recipe involves making the meatballs in a classic way but the exciting part is actually cook them in coconut milk and it gives a really nice new dimension to a sort of soft rich sumptuous meatball chop the onion nice and finely keeping those slices very close together close closer the slices the finer the onions pat it back down at an angle slice down and just chop i want the onions nice and fine because i want some finesse to these meatballs and the secret of a really good meatball is the texture getting that balance right between the minced beef the breadcrumbs the milk and the seasoning a couple cloves of garlic slice the garlic really nice and thinly nice pan nice and hot a tablespoon of olive oil quite generous with the olive oil onions and garlic in a touch of salt and pepper with your mince open it up a little bit and sort of pat it out salt and pepper for me a good meatball is all about the softness the texture of that rich beef and the way it sort of melts in your mouth you can color it on the outside but you want it nice and soft and sort of rich in the center mix that in beautifully and then paste it back out again i've got some really nice dried chili flakes i'm gonna season the onions with the chili flakes chili flakes in cook that out for two minutes i'm gonna add some milk [Music] take your bread crumbs make a little well three four tablespoons of milk that makes a sort of nice slightly doughy texture but it lightens the texture of the meatball place that in add your onions your garlic and your chilli in there as well nice put your hands in there and start mixing them if you've got the right amount of milk and breadcrumbs it doesn't mean binding with an egg don't make them too small the problem with making them too small is the fact that they dry out quickly just the size of a golf ball a little bit bigger nice really nice tight squeeze that stops it from breaking up it always pays to double the recipe and spend a bit more time making extra meatballs so you can freeze a batch ready for another time give the pan a little wipe out don't wash out that pan we've got that flavour from the onions and the garlic at the bottom get that pan nice and hot a touch of olive oil in there place them at the top of your pan nice and gently sit them in the oil get a pallet knife and go underneath them and just sort of tilt the pan and let the pan cook the back of the meatball we're going to add some heat coanda seeds slightly spicy and peppery just to give a really nice flavor to the coconut milk in next some cardamom seeds three or four onto the board knife on in a little touch of turmeric into the center of the pan that's going to give it a really nice spicy flavor a little pinch cinnamon all the time you're doing this those meatballs are just getting tastier and tastier a couple of dried chilies let them infuse in that oil and then some lemongrass just take the back of your knife and sort of beat it down that starts to release all that lovely sort of fragrance like someone's just let off the most amazing fragrant air freshener in the lemongrass and finally some fresh ginger just peel and slice nice and thinly time now to turn them over and let the other half a wonderful flavor chicken stock in bring the stock up to the boil turn the gas up and then add the coconut milk i want the coconut milk just sitting underneath the top of the meatball coconut milk in and that sort of gives it that creamy richness but it's not heavy it's a fragrant light richness before we start simmering check the seasoning that nice soft texture of the meatball but that fragrance light richness of the coconut broth just gonna cook those meatballs perfectly bring the broth up to the boil then simmer gently for eight to ten minutes touch them with your finger this should be slightly pliable but slightly springy gas off i'm gonna finish it off with something light and fresh zest of lime but i want the zest on top of the meatball so i'll cut through that richness and then finally squeeze the fresh lime and that just gives it that nice zesty amazing taste stir in the juice [Music] i've got that kick and that vibrant taste the exciting part when you come to serve it be generous with that coconut broth tilt the pan get a good couple of ladles of the broth in meatballs [Music] and that is a very delicious way of eating a old-fashioned meatball and bringing it into the 21st century and they're just as good cooked from frozen as well [Music] the secret to stress-free cooking is making it easy for yourself here are three more recipes all based on my delicious freezer friendly meatballs just defrost them before you get started first up beef meatballs with ariketti kale and pine nuts [Music] add meatballs to hot oil and brown meanwhile cook educated pasta then add chopped garlic to the meatballs and shredded kale a delicious green veg packed with vitamins which cooks in minutes cabbage is a great alternative if you can't get kale put in some of the cooking water from the pasta to steam when the pasta is cooked al dente drain and add to the meatballs season then finish with sweet buttery pine nuts and grated fresh parmesan cheese meatballs with oliketti kale and pine nuts from meatballs to meal in minutes my next easy standby supper is beef meatball sandwich with melting mozzarella and tomato salsa [Music] top a lightly toasted roll with pan-fried

meatball recipe four deliciously different dishes food that's certain to make your life in the kitchen easier and stress-free amazing whether you're making great food to freeze or to take straight to the table you need to know how to shop for the best ingredients next up my shopping guide to oils it doesn't matter if you're baking frying or dressing salads using the right oil can dramatically alter the taste and texture here are the most common oils and what to use them for [Music] sunflower oil is a good value all-rounder nice and light for frying baking in dressings and spicy dishes groundnuts or peanut oil is great for cooking on high heat as it gets really hot without burning sesame oil a flavoursome sweet and nutty oil perfect sprinkled over asian dishes before serving rapeseed oil is a healthier choice for using in salads i love walnut oil fantastically fragrant it's brilliant for salad dressings and it gives cakes a distinctive flavor but the oil i use most in my cooking is olive oil [Music] to find some of the best olive oils sold in britain you have to go to one of the most unlikely places an electrical shop in london's east end [Music] turkish born mehmet morat has olive all in his blood my family's produced this olive oil for centuries what he doesn't know about it isn't worth knowing the very best extra virgin olive oil is first cold pressed it's actually pressed by stone and then it's put through a centrifugal spinner which spins out all the bitter waters and then you've got pure olive oil cold pressed olive oil and you've got to taste it to believe it pour a little sample slurp it draw it in without don't swallow it warm it in your mouth coat the whole of the inside of your mouth with it and then swallow it'll go down like fruit juice and it will leave no greasiness or oiliness in your mouth whatsoever absolutely sensational beautiful my favorite use of any olive oils is to pour it into a bowl room temperature rub some wild oregano into it and get some fresh crusty bread and just dip it it's food on its own don't need anything else welcome back to my ultimate cookery course next on my guide to making it easy i'll be creating a sweet treat to drool over i want the chocolate my little matchsticks dotted around but first my quick guide to the basic kit you need to get cooking fantastic food you don't need to spend a fortune on masses of kitchen equipment here are three more kitchen essentials [Music] whisk spoon and spatula these three items are so cheap yet they are so important to great home cooking a whisk there's so much more control when you've got something whisking in your hand you can gauge it so much better than you can if it's an electric mixer the bigger the balloon on your hand whisk the faster it'll whip as it draws in more air wooden spoons don't scratch pans and should be washed by hand spatulas are indispensable for baking or mixing make sure it's heat resistant so it doesn't melt but more importantly phenomenal for making omelettes great with scrambled eggs and you waste nothing because the spatula almost cleans the bowl instantly with these three you'll be well on your way to cooking like a pro and you'll need all three for my next recipe [Music] my take on classic chocolate brownies is guaranteed but a smart on anyone's face and not just when they're fresh out of the oven blondies stock up in these delicious blondies they'll keep for up to a week and it's a great way of getting ahead of your expecting guest round first off melt the butter for the mixture we've had hundreds and hundreds of brownies the sort of white chocolate version i.e blondies are amazing a little bit more subtle keep a little knob of butter for the end just to grease your baking tray turn the gas down and gently melt that butter caster sugar into the bowl [Music] just give that butter a little whisk sort of makes the mixture a little bit lighter slightly fluffy off with the gas a pinch of salt in the sugar then make a little well in the middle and sort of whisk you can see it's already gone nice and blonde love it give that a really good mix and the secret with the butter be slightly warm sort of it melts the sugar nice and smooth lovely a teaspoon of vanilla extract in next lightly whisk in two whole eggs just give them a little beat this is such a delicious recipe yet so simple whisk in the eggs looking for that nice sort of rich textured smooth paste you can see why we call these blondies beautiful next teaspoon of baking powder baking powder in then half a teaspoon of baking soda that aerates the mixture and gives it that little tartness you'll see this sort of rise instantly the minute they hit the oven and then your flour whisk with one hand and just slowly add half the flour first get that all mixed up make sure that mixture is really nice and smooth check it occasionally no lumps half flour in and then the other half in you'll feel it sort of almost nice and firm and that's why it's so important to add the flour in stages it stops the mixture going lumpy it should be just dropping off the whisk beautiful change over from a whisk to a spoon next i want some texture some nice sweet chewiness to the blondies dried cranberries they bake beautifully but it gives the blondie a really nice sort of chewy sweetness in the center next a white chocolate i'm not gonna grate it i'm gonna chop it up just slice it like little bits of shrapnel i want the chocolate like little matchsticks dotted around now chocolate in lovely fold that in i want a nice even distribution of those wonderful dried cranberries don't over mix it i want to break up that chocolate nice even mix of cranberries and chocolate you can see the chocolate there'll be parts of the chocolate in the oven that will actually melt there'll be like little pools of white melted chocolate in the center now a baking tray small little knob of butter and the grease baking tray and line it some greaseproof paper and just over extend it shiny side out dull side hits the bottom of the tray in greaseproof allows me to maximize on the white chocolate inside the mix no greaseproof paper the chocolate can melt and almost stick to the tray so the paper is just a really nice insurance policy secondly we want that rise and that sort of crispness now with the mix get your spatula all the way around i don't want to see anything left in that bowl position the bowl over your tray nice and carefully loudly don't leave that slice in the bowl nobody's licking that one and then just take the back of the spatula go into the corners push and come back into the middle turn the tray around let it work to your advantage try and get it evenly positioned in the tray if it goes in even it cooks evenly make sure you smooth out the top of the blondie with the back of the spatula and then into the oven it's going to rise nice and crisp all that soft gooeyness in the center bake your blondies at 180 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes that smells incredible it's got that crisp edge on the outside in that sort of soft gooey center leave that to cool down and it's going to sort of firm up and wrinkle but it'll stay nice and gooey in the center once it's cooled down take it out and start slicing [Music] mouth-watering blonde is a fantastic easy treat to have on hand for yourself or to share [Music] next my tricks of the trade and kitchen tips to make your life easier make sure you make the most of your freezer my tip for amazing tuna capacio is to freeze it first and it will slice beautifully it's wise to save leftover wine for cooking my tip is to freeze the remaining wine in freezer bags or ice cube trays it's great in stocks and sauces [Music] when you freeze suits or stews in tubs the tip is not to overfill them leave room to expand in the container a great tip for a cheap homemade ice cream buy a high quality vanilla ice cream and make it your own by mixing in berries chocolate or my favorite rum and boozy raisins [Music] a fantastic tip for leftover lemons and limes is to cut them into wedges freeze and use them like ice cubes they won't water down your drink and

your life on right now it's all about stress-free cooking cooking dishes in advance is a brilliant way of taking the stress out of cooking at home and many dishes just get better and better with time first up my amazing sticky pork ribs one of the secrets to great cooking is patience leaving dishes to marinade for one or two days helps to develop the flavor in your food and the end result so much more delicious it's a method i use in the restaurants all the time first off get your roasting tray put the tray on the gas pork ribs 60 meat and 35 40 fat give them a really good season salt and pepper nice thing about this cut they stay incredibly moist when they're on the bone and the longer you cook them the more delicious they become and just push all that seasoning in to the pork olive oil in make sure that tray's nice and hot and i really want that nice sort of caramelization taking place on the pork that's the nice thing about starting it on top of the stove use your roasting tray get them colored and then the oven putting the ribs straight in the oven you don't get the color it looks sort of boiled as opposed to a nice caramelized rib ginger you can't beat fresh ginger with sticky pork ribs place it down nice and firmly and slice the thinner you slice the ginger the more fragrant the ribs garlic now it's really important before you add anything to those ribs make sure we've got the color from the ribs first don't rush it turn them over that's what i want that nice crispy color as they sort of braise in the oven all that color just turns into the most amazing flavor braising is just a chef's turn for cooking something slowly in liquid right ginger and garlic in spread it around on all those ribs to sort of roast the ginger and the garlic chili flakes chili flakes in next szechuan pepper citrusy vibrant peppercorns incredible in next staranese that gives it a really nice sort of aniseedy flavor almost like you're roasting the ribs in fennel and now we've got the heat got the spice i want to sweeten things up a little bit some fresh honey honey glazes the pork beautifully counteracts against all that spice in there but look what's happening a colour on the ribs is extraordinary it's like a really nice chili sweet caramel now soy sauce brings that little bit of sort of saltiness to it really generous with the soy sauce japanese vinegar two tablespoons of vinegar in rice wine it gives it that nice sort of um tartness the ribs if you can't find rice wine our dry sherry's a great substitute 300 ml that takes out the heat of that szechuan pepper those dry chili flakes make sure they all lay down like a nice tight box of matches bring that up to the boil cooking is all about learning to develop your own likes and dislikes so always keep tasting to make sure you're happy with the combination of flavors it's lacking a little touch of vinegar all that sharpness now think what's going on the tartness the heat the caramel the color on the ribs is amazing i want a bit of a sort of oniony flavor put some springiness in whilst these ribs are in the oven the spring onions will sort of puree but give a sharpness the final taste of that pork in with my spring onions and with my stock 400 ml of stock this is just a simple chicken stock the stock just sits underneath the ribs it absorbs into the rib and the top of the rib glazes underneath the rib that gets crispy and rich and that's what makes the ribs nice and moist really important into the oven cook at 180 for 30 minutes then turn the ribs over and cook for a further 30 minutes now wow they smell incredible each side has got that really nice crispy roasted edge becomes sticky and chewy and sweet sour the fats disappeared and the pork just melts in your mouth i want to take them to the next level gas back on now shake the tray and this is the sort of the way that we finish them in the restaurant every minute they glaze in that tray they just get to taste better and better now look at them i'm so happy with those ribs done absolutely delicious now but if you want you can put them in the fridge and the flavor will keep developing then just reheat them when you want to serve so [Music] each rib has a nice slice of ginger on there [Music] wow look at that delicious sticky ribs with an amazing marinade to make my food the tastiest it can be i always start with the best ingredients i can find and the secret to getting the best is simple knowledge is crucial the more you know about where your ingredients come from and how they produce the better so ask lots of questions and learn when it comes to buying pork you can't do any better than ask a butcher and award-winning master butcher danny lidgate knows everything about the pig from trotter to tail his family have been in the meat business for 150 years so this man really is on the money in comparison with other meats pork's really good value you get some really good cuts at really reasonable prices and you can use everything from the tip of the trotter down to the cheek we can see here we've got the leg the leg is about this region really lean really good for things like gammons and hams coming down from the leg we've got the loin and that's where the pork chops come from if you take the bones out you can bone and roll it and you end up with a really nice easy to cook cylinder of meat really easy to carve carve like a loaf of bread coming away from the loin we've got the belly and you can see what belly is made up of fatty parts and meaty parts don't be scared of the amount of fat that's on it you need that fat to give give the flavors coming through also make sure you can possibly buy it with the skin on the skin will crispen up nice and give you good crackling also add flavor into the fat lower down from the bellies we've got the shoulders really the shoulders are a great meat they're slightly fattier than the rest of the animal you can see with this pork shoulder the amount of marbling you get in the muscles the interior marbling make sure you look for the marbling it's essential for the flavor and it's going to make a really good eating experience with a pig there really is nothing to waste the trotters even are really good flavor because they're geletinous qualities and the meat can be really really flavoursome also there's pigs cheeks which obviously require a little bit more cooking because of the use they get but the flavors you're gonna get are gonna be completely different to any other part of a pig pork is an incredibly versatile meat they say the only part you can't eat is the oink here's my guide to getting the best out of familiar cuts smoked or unsmoked bacon is not just for breakfast it's brilliant transforming salads gives a real depth of flavor to stews and is delicious in quick and easy pasta dishes [Music] the leg joint best known for ham also makes an inexpensive delicious sunday roast and it's great served with peas pudding and

chutney that's brilliant for transforming the simplest of suppers they don't actually smell much but the flavor they give off is extraordinary but first five more of my 100 tips to make your home cooking easier kicking off with how to skin and de-bone a fish the hassle-free way this is basically a filleted side of salmon it's been taken off the bone and now skin off pick up your knife a really nice broad flexible filleting knife a little sharpen lift up the base of the towel and then just nick a little bit at the end there twist the knife almost as if it's horizontally underneath the salmon pull the skin and you slice the salmon underneath and let the knife do the work now get your skin flip it back over and check you're not leaving too much salmon on top of the skin pull it back nice and slowly get the skin wrap it around your fingers pull the salmon towards you and then just all the way through lay that down one nicely skinned salmon just like a perfect snakeskin get your knife and just run the knife down and then with a pair of tweezers these are fish tweezers but you can use normal tweezers look for the head up and pull and with the skin being removed from underneath the salmon the pin bones come out a lot easier and the pimples only go to just basically halfway along the fillet one nice fillet of salmon beautiful [Music] there's still plenty of flavor in the trimmings from affiliated fish my tip is don't waste those fish bones add to water why a bay leaf and some chopped veg to make a simple but versatile fish talk at home the perfect base for a delicious fish soup [Music] a great tip for intensely flavored stress-free veg is to steam them in their own juices simply add to a pan with a knob of butter and seasoning then cook on a low heat with a lid on to lock in the moisture [Music] for crispy roast potatoes you can depend on my tip is to par boil them leave them to steam dry then sprinkle them with semolina or flour and give them a good roughing up this ensures they go really crispy in the oven a great tip for browning meat or fish is to dry it with kitchen roll before you cook it then you'll get a much better color too much moisture makes the meat steam instead of sear and you'll lose that rich brown crust like the one i got on those sticky pork ribs another secret to taking the stress out of cooking is to anticipate the really busy times when you'll need things to hand that are already made my next recipe can be kept on tap in the fridge for weeks on end and is guaranteed to liven up any quick meal spicy chutney with chutney standing by in the fridge you can always add that special little touch to a simple supper prove that thinking ahead always pays off pan on start toasting those spices keep the pan nice and low cumin very aromatic very fragrant and it's almost like a light spice next nice little coriander seeds coriander in now you're going to get a bit of heat in the chutney mustard seeds well smaller than coriander seeds but so much more powerful mustard seeds in now curry leaves they don't actually smell much dry but the flavor they give off is extraordinary coli's in really important not to burn them otherwise you'll have that bitter taste across the chutney keep the gas nice and low the secret is sort of toasting them so it releases that oil and intensifies the spice a touch of salt and then a couple of small powerful chilies keep them whole no one's going to eat them but it gives that real nice burst of heat now let them toast gently there we're not going to chop the onion we're going to grate it why because it sort of breaks down to a really nice puree in the chutney when you're grated hold the root in the palm of your hand and just push nice long grates want those nice long shards look i've almost got a nice sort of onion puree but it's nice and clear a touch of olive oil spices nicely toasted onions in [Music] three nice cloves of garlic slightly crushed on [Music] lay it nice and flat and just slice the garlic nice thin slices garlic in taking your time to get the owners caramelised beautifully will really reap rewards in the long run tamarind paste and sugar in with the sugar first three nice tablespoons of sugar that will give a really nice syrup effect sort of nice rich syrupy texture to the chutney tamarind paste you can get tamarind paste in most delis and the big supermarkets it's really nice thickening asian but gives that tartness the chutney and it's sort of rich sugary spicy next in with my coconut add four nice tablespoons that will give a nice body and a really nice texture to the chutney cook that coconut out and now add the carrot grated the carrot just gives the chutney really nice sort of crunch but also helps to sort of cool down the spice carrots in the water comes out the carrot flavors the chutney beautifully but gives that nice sort of vibrant bright color to it as well and grating it almost sort of it cooks instantly but i want a

Follow...",2022-11-30 22:16:02.926159, [Music] i go fishing a lot and scotch eggs are the perfect all-in-one mini picnic breakfast first thing get your eggs cooked bring the water up the boil onto the spoon and lower them into the water that way they don't hit the water and crack four and a half minutes that'll keep the center nice and slightly runny now ground sausage meat i'm gonna make mine a little bit spicier i'm gonna crumble in black pudding that helps to season the scotch eggs inside a little touch of salt and pepper and then just to make it a little bit sweeter and a lot easier for the kids to eat some grated apple [Music] combine that blend in the apple and the black pudding eggs once they're cooked drain them and then run them under cold water cracking and cooling the eggs quickly will prevent the yolks turning gray tap them on the side of the pan put them back into the water and what happens the water seeps underneath the shell see the shell come off so much easier eggs still slightly soft in the center i want that little bit of richness with the yolk next you need to get yourself organized with a mini assembly line seasoned flour a little egg wash and breadcrumbs take your mince golf ball size spread the pate manipulate with your thumb and then sit your egg in there and spread the sausage over the egg and you just seal that over it's really important to keep that nice even coating of sausage meat around the egg you don't want it too thick otherwise it gets too dense and it's unappetizing give them a light dusting in the seasoned flour if you don't put the flour on the egg wash won't stick if you don't put the egg wash on the breadcrumbs won't stick into the egg roll it round shake off any excess egg wash and roll it into your breadcrumbs you can use this same three-stage method to breadcrumb anything you like from chicken goujons and fish fillets to fina schnitzel these are panko breadcrumbs japanese white breadcrumb so no crust you can experiment by adding flavours to your breadcrumbs like parmesan herbs or citrus zest i always like to push the actual breadcrumbs into the sausage meat so it gets that really nice golden brown and stops any of the outside burning once bread crumbs lower the eggs carefully into a four centimeter deep bath of hot vegetable oil for 10 to 12 minutes the eggs are actually cooked soft and running the center so the objective is just to cook the sausage meat and the black pudding look great don't they go and grenades there's something so magical about a scotch egg on a picnic because it's like this little mini breakfast beautiful drain them onto the paper roll them round just to get off any excess oil and then to transport them some greaseproof paper that for me is the perfect start to the fishing trip there's no wonder i never catch any fish because i'm always too busy eating my scotch eggs [Music] my ultimate black pudding lace scotch eggs an irresistibly delicious picnic breakfast my ultimate picnic keeps it simple with dishes that all work brilliantly well together and that's one of the secrets you have to treat a picnic like a celebration meal make sure you've got a stunning selection and a great balance of tastes and textures but above all make sure it's fun i've saved my three most indulgent dishes for a tea time picnic treat a stunning prawn and cucumber salad with a spicy yogurt dressing a simply delicious anchovy dip and a sticky chocolate fridge cake that won't fail to revive a flag in family until he's keen to get in on the action [Music] what are your favorites a marshmallow and peanut fridge cake perfect for a picnic first things first we have to slowly melt the chocolate that's bad that's good i'm gonna break up the chocolate right in there next butter goes in couple tablespoons of golden syrup it's so good if we melt chocolate too quickly it starts to separate and destroy the best and safest way to melt chocolate is always use a bain-marie but i'm going to keep a really close eye on mine and heat it over a super low heat this stunning little cake has your favorites in there our digestives now put your hands in there and give them like that one at a time ago and crush what's the one thing that you love about a picnic i love eating outside especially on a nice summery day not so much in the winter though no that's gonna be the crunchy part of our fridge cake and it's called a fridge cake because it can sit in the fridge or you can freeze it now peanuts in please can you use it without peanuts if you're allergic to peanuts oh you can do yeah definitely now what are these little babies cranberries cranberries from there marshmallows my favorite okay they're so bright aren't they why do you love marshmallows so much because they're so squishy all right give that a nice mix up chocolate is melting nicely okay i want you to pour that in and i'll mix it nice and gently slowly slowly slowly soon nice now touch more please good isn't it good give that a little mix with daddy please look they're all melty nice and creamy and gooey now we're gonna line the tray so this is quite easy to make because um you don't have to bake it mm-hmm you just set it yeah i want you to start pushing it into the corners please with your fingers just laying it nice and flat ah it's all nice and marshmallow and oozy to get the spatula okay and look how delicious does that look really delicious i can eat it right now i couldn't because it's not set so when that sets okay it'll go nice and firm and then we can cut it into little bars little squares triangles triangles push push good but the important part pushing it down is that we can slice it and the more we push the thinner we can slice okay [Music] fridge cake's done now i'm gonna make the most amazing anchovy dip with vegetables and bread first cut slices of baguette and bake in the oven at 180 degrees c for six minutes or until crisp meanwhile roughly chopped garlic and shallots and add to a food processor along with a tin of good quality anchovies [Music] sprinkle in some pitted black olives flat leaf parsley and drizzle in the reserved anchovy oil and a little olive oil blitz to a paste and add pepper then decant into a jar ready to transport serve with a handful of fresh baby carrots peppery radishes and your crisp baguette toast anchovy dip a portable and deliciously palatable alfresco treat [Music] now a spicy chilli yogurt dressing with a prawn salad first things first i'd like you to make the dressing fish sauce doesn't really smell like fishes so one and a half tablespoons of fish sauce two chilli i like this especially if you have it on the side of the form a little teaspoon of sugar oh that's it good and so four tablespoons of yogurt three four zest in there why are you making it in a jam jar not a bowl well this is for a little picnic and it's a great way of transporting we squeeze the lime in there and then we put [Music] it's a bit like a tummy see that sounds like my tummy only sometimes only sometimes thank you for that kind of gives you the first time you have it's like a little thingy it's fresh salty citrusy but delicious now cucumber and the salad i want to get rid of all the seeds so if you just nice and gently peel the cucumber why do you feel it can you not eat the skin on it you can eat the skin but i want this salad to taste light and fresh you can use a knife for this too though can't you you can peel with a knife but a speed peeler takes off the slices nice and thinly so much quicker so much quicker that's why it's called a speed peeler looks better now looks a bit naked it does look a bit naked doesn't it now you get your spoon let's see what happens a teaspoon just takes out all those seeds so whilst it sits in the dish it doesn't make the salad go all soft because that cucumber is nice and crunchy [Music] that's really good there you go so see where your knuckles are there that's what's always going to protect if you put that little finger out this little piggy boom comes off what did i tell you about daddy's knuckle that's the first place you cut off all the time there you go the next addition to our prawn salad is firm juicy baby gem lettuce look at the lettuce in half what about the butt the butts [Music] i'm keeping the butts on for now so when i slice it it stays together okay and then a little bit there we don't use okay when you prepare lettuce for a picnic you never slice it too thinly okay otherwise it will it's good prawns are ready [Music] your tummy sauce is ready your dressing is ready take the lid off and the trick is you dress the bottom of your dish because i'm going to put the prawns on here to protect the lettuce get your cucumber i put my cucumber on and then finally that is okay now the salad is not going to go soft why is that because it's not that it's not straight onto the dressing that's right what happens is we wrap this now and then we get to our picnic drizzle the sauce on top we mix it up we've got the dressing on the bottom and the dressing on top of the dressing that's right a little bit of tim film do you know the cling film check i don't know the clint field trick yet no thing fell over the top of the toilet what you don't understand it when you're my age oh you've been my age then well okay salad in the fridge with the dressing ready to go for a picnic this is my ultimate picnic dinner feast prawn and cucumber salad with a spicy yogurt dressing anchovy dip with crudites and the kids favorite chocolate marshmallow and peanut fridge cake you

chef i know it's not what you spend on ingredients but results on the plate that count using cheap cuts and leftovers and working them hard in the kitchen gives you food and a budget that tastes a million bucks and i'm gonna show you how first up my flavor-packed lamb with fried bread whether i'm cooking high-end dishes or rustic dishes trust me it all has to be impressive so this lamb dish proves that you don't have to spend a fortune to create delicious food first off put the pan on this is a lamb steak and it's cut just above the leg just here because you can see that delicious bone running through the center and that's full of marrow so that just gives the lamb a nice added sweet flavor just take your knife cut through each end this stops the lamb steak from buckling so therefore it cooks evenly and colors beautifully salt and pepper lamb needs quite a lot of help with the pepper so be quite generous with the pepper and just pat that down the pan is just under smoke on the outside now put the oil in get that pan really nice and hot because this is a cheap cut so i'm depending on the color of the lamb steak to really sort of impart a lot of flavor that's the noise you want to hear you can't hear that noise don't drop the steak in put a little bit of garlic in there not chopped garlic just whole cloves the garlic lightly crushed don't even waste time peeling them in tongs lift up that bit of fat around the back that's the top of the leg tilt the pan and let all that fat render rendering is a chef's term that means melting the fat it works brilliantly when you're cooking a rib eye as well cut it that over there beautiful now it looks like an expensive cut and we've got that nice even sear all over as it's cooking just tilt the pan and vase and basting the lamb steak just means you're sort of adding all that nice scented garlic olive oil back into the lamb useful now take the lamb out let the lamb rest [Music] now for the perfect rustic crouton so this bread's quite firm a couple of days old just slice it straight down the center dice it up put it into a bowl season it beautifully [Music] from there i'm gonna add some milk sounds strange adding milk to crouton but it just gives it that nice rich creamy texture and just let that milk sort of absorb into the bread while that's soaking i'm gonna make the dressing go back to that initial garlic that was in the pan look at that beautiful into the pest and water anchovies anchovies go brilliantly well with lamb i want that nice salty vinegary flavor and a bit of kick some capers the little baby cats very sweet now just pound that to a nice paste that smells incredible next some dijon mustard a nice teaspoon and a half in a little bit of red wine vinegar two tablespoons and then our extra virgin olive oil now it's got that heat in there i've got a nice roasted garlic a real hearty chunky vinaigrette that sort of seeps into that lamb some fresh parsley crunch up the parsley delicious flavor parsley in nice now get your pan hot for the croutons olive oil in the pan grab the croutons and squeeze all that excess milk out not too hard i don't want them dry and in and then just fry them and the milk inside these croutons give it a nice spongy creamy delicious flavor that's the color i want nice now take them out and lightly drain them a little bit of kitchen roll onto the board out [Music] plate them just take this amazing vinaigrette and spread it get those croutons listen to them like little boulders hitting the play the lamb sit that on next one on the rest of the croutons on now use all those little bits and my chef in paris would kill me right now if you saw me using those because they're the ugly scraps that customers should never see but but they're the best bits croutons on and then just drop that sauce on all those little bits of the lamb and there that is a perfect way of taking a cheap cut is the premier league of dishes stunning food doesn't have to be complicated keeping it simple produces amazing results and keeps costs down here are three more great easy dishes that don't cost the earth but taste absolutely incredible starting with roasted mackerel with garlic and paprika [Music] first make a spicy paste by crushing garlic in a pestle and mortar along with paprika sea salt and olive oil spoon the paste onto phillips of mackerel a great inexpensive oily fish that's really healthy and leaf to marinade when ready to eat put the mackerel fillets on a baking tray skin side up season and roast in a hot oven next make a tangy potato salad for the dressing mix dijon mustard white wine vinegar olive oil and saffron [Music] and whisk until blended boil new potatoes in salted water drain and lightly crush add sliced spring onion and spoon in the vinaigrette [Applause] to serve top the potato salad with the roasted mackerel and drizzle with more vinaigrette [Music] a healthy meal that makes the most of cheap but delicious fish stunning roasted mackerel with garlic and paprika [Music] my next brilliant budget dish is pork and prawn balls in aromatic broth [Music] for the pork and porn balls in a bowl add pork mince then add finely chopped prawns [Music] diced ginger and chopped chives season and roll into ping pong size balls [Music] for the broth heat fresh stock and add star anise oyster sauce soy sauce and sliced ginger gently simmer fry the pork and prawn balls in a pan until golden then transfer to the bubbling broth add handfuls of spinach then serve topped with finely sliced spring onions a gorgeous healthy dish that uses great value ingredients with amazing results pork and prawn balls in aromatic broth ready to eat in under 20 minutes an incredibly simple recipe that's perfect for using up leftovers easy arancini delicious golden rice balls [Music] first chop mozzarella into small cubes then take handfuls of leftover risotto add a cube of mozzarella and fold into a ball around the cheese this dish is perfect with leftover mushroom risotto but it's great with any risotto for the coating prep three bowls one with flour one with breadcrumbs and one with beaten egg dip each arentini first into the flour then the egg wash and finally the breadcrumbs then in a pan heat the olive oil and fry the arancini until golden brown [Music] drain and serve simply with lemon [Music] easy arancini a delicious tempting treat that's great for leftovers and cooks in under 10 minutes three quick and easy recipes that give maximum flavor for minimum cost fantastic dishes that prove you don't have to spend a fortune to eat amazing food at home nice [Music] five more of my 100 tips they'll make cooking in the kitchen easier first up a great cheap staple how to cook the perfect rice basmati rice the king of all rice is light fluffy delicious and i'm going to show you how to cook it perfectly now start off with 400 grams of rice rice in spot on so what i'm going to do now is just rinse off the dust and the starch cold water always and just rinse the rice that stops the rice from becoming clumpy in the pan and allows it to become really nice light and fluffy once it's cooked rice into the pan now to make a plain fluffy rice exciting we're going to infuse it three cardamom pods and just get the pods and just pierce them so it allows all that flavor to come out cardamom pods and then star anise now these are beautiful whole star anise it makes it really nice and fragrant salt and pepper a lot easier to season the rice now than it is once it's cooked you start to break it up when you season once it's cooked now it's basically one part rice to one and a half part water 600 mils always start off in cold water cold water in onto the gas lid on bring it up to the ball as quick as possible and turn it down and let it simmer for 8 to 10 minutes and that's the secret behind cooking great rice allow it to steam as it's cooking do not lift that lid up lid off [Music] it smells aromatic basically all the water's absorbed the rice has doubled in size and is nice and light and fluffy take the staranise out the cardamom pods they all should have risen to the top pods out take your fork fluff it through basically just sort of starts to open everything back up once you've forked it through it becomes really nice and light and fluffy and there that is perfectly cooked rice always make the most of your leftovers use last night's rice in stir fries scrambled up with eggs or it's simple to make a delicious fresh salad remember a good cook wastes nothing a great tip for stopping potatoes apples and avocados from going brown wing cut simply cover with water and add a squeeze of lemon the acidity stops the flesh from oxidizing which is what causes the color to change herbs are great for adding flavor without spending a fortune to keep them at their best simply place them in a glass of water and they'll stay fresh for up to a week [Music] and if you've got extra herbs left over save and waste by making an amazing flavoured oil place wash and dried stems in a bottle cover with warmed olive oil then seal and leave to infuse great for salads pastas and drizzling on veg [Music] this is my ultimate cookery course 100 recipes to stake your life on later i'll be showing you an incredible spicy sausage rice that cost next to nothing bulky delicious and incredibly robust but first when you're cooking on a budget you can still eat fantastic meats just make sure you're getting the most for your money next up my shopping guide to buying the best hams salamis and sausages these fine italian meats are packed with flavour and a little goes a long way and nobody knows that better than deli maestro antonio sakamani i born in italy and i start eating italian food and i love it i want to change it for nothing else that's why i'm fat he's been selling delicious cured meats in the heart of london soho for more than 35 years this is the best prosciutto they come from italy this is curing parma because it's parma ham divine people love it and it's wonderful the fat is good because you make the meat sweet they should be cut thin like this there is more flavor you can eat with melon with figs with pears with everything any sweet fruit is good it's wonderful you really enjoy when you start eating you can stop wonderful this is called prisaola it's a hair cured beef it comes from north italy valtelina it's so different from pork there's no fat at all it should be no fun otherwise it tastes greasy it's good when it's very dry and you slice it thinner you just eat it like that or you can eat with a bit of rocket or you save some parmesan on top i love it a bit of lemon if you like or olive oil it's delicious this is called felino for me is the best salami take the name of our little place near parma and other is country salami very nice it's one of my favorite because it's not too spicy just meat flavor just salt and pepper i love it i can't resist when i take some meat home i don't eat nothing else especially in the evening just meat with a melon or fish or whatever a few slices of bread a couple glasses of wine that's my meal you don't need nothing else you know you you happy antonio's right incredible italian hams and salamis are fantastic in simple salads sandwiches or even eaten by themselves and you don't need much to make an impression there's an amazing selection of delicious meats from around the world that are great to use in the kitchen another simple meaty staple that's perfect for quick easy suppers with a difference are the exotic regional speciality sausages that have such distinctive tastes and are a million miles from the great british banger here are four of my favorites that are definitely worth your money chirizo from spain these have an incredibly deep red color are full of smoky spiced paprika and are great for stuffing stews and paellas merguez from north africa made from beef and mutton these cook super fast because of the long and thin shape and can be used in tagines or served with couscous fennel sausages from italy made from pork and packed with sweet aniseed flavor fennel seeds these are perfect with pasta or as a topping on a pizza finally jerk sausages from jamaica full of blow your head off scotch bonnet chilis these are super spicy and great in tangy casseroles or simply sauteed with onions and garlic be adventurous with your sausages learn about the different flavors and you'll soon be using them to add extra flavor with ease for dishes that always pack a punch without costing a fortune simple and cheap delicious ingredients like sausages are great and you don't need a lot of them to get stunning dishes that taste incredible so spend your money wisely and you can have amazing midweek meals that don't cost the earth my next recipe is all about great flavors and it's as cheap and easy to make as it is delicious spicy sausage rice whatever you're cooking the secret to making great food is to ensure you're locking every last ounce of flavour in that pan and this spicy sausage rice does exactly that take these spicy sausages and pierce that skin because i want all that delicious spicy sausage meat out of this casing and you get more flavor from the sausage when you take them out the casing sausage is ready turn on the gas bread onion less acidic than a big white spanish onion and a lot more flavoursome tablespoon of olive oil a tablespoon only because i want all that fat coming out the sausages to sort of really help flavor the onions onions in and the onions go in first because you can never rush cooking an onion it's really important to sort of give them five to six minutes in the pan so you can really start to caramelize them my mouth and my pepper slice around wasting nothing i want to see that sort of little core those pips in the center no fine diced pepper the rice is going to be cooking for 20 minutes so i want the veg to sort of have texture after it's cooked peppers in a bit of garlic two nice cloves just slap down off with the shell garlic in now i want to turn up the gas get the pan nice and hot because the minute that sausage goes in everything cools down and you'll end up boiling the peppers and the onions and the garlic so heat up to maximum and then just make a well in the center in now start stirring quickly this is where you get so much more bang for your buck out of sausages because the skins off and the real flavor of that spicy italian sausage is gonna come through what's great about this recipe is that you can use any type of sausage to get the flavor and the heat you want i've gone for the spicy italian but it's just as good with merguez or cheeto a teaspoon paprika in give it that really nice smoky flavor rice in and we're gonna sort of basically sear the rice we call it in the kitchen blasting the rice where we sort of soda the rice for 30 seconds and it takes on all that flavor next white wine so the wine sort of deglazes the pan and washes all that flavor from the bottom of the pan into the rice stock in bring it up to the boil turn it down and let it simmer [Music] double stop to rice turn that gas down and let it simmer for 12 to 15 minutes and just give it the occasional stir keep an eye on it now get ready to finish it slice spring onions diced sweet juicy tomatoes and roughly chop earthy flat leaf parsley spring onions in tomatoes in off with the gas really important otherwise everything becomes overcooked flat leaf parsley in but look at the volume in that pan now that is an amazing way to take spicy italian sausages to a completely different level beautiful [Music] follow my ultimate cookery course packed with key lessons top tips and 100 recipes to stake your life on and you'll literally be cooking yourself into a better chef many of these amazing recipes are on my app please check out the app store for details go on get cooking welcome to my ultimate cookery course packed with cooking tips information and 100 recipes to stay your life on right this is more ultimate food on a budget [Music] vegetables are such an asset in the kitchen healthy fantastically fresh and incredibly versatile and pound for pound they're so much cheaper than fish or meat just make sure you give them plenty of attitude my first recipe is so quick and easy but seriously impressive and deceptively cheap homemade gnocchi making your enoki is so simple to do yet the results are absolutely stunning and it's a great way of using up leftover baked potatoes you can make noki just with flour and eggs however the potato gives it a nice light sort of creamy fluffy texture cut them in half take your spoon and scoop the inside of those potatoes i'm using leftover baked potatoes but this really works as well with leftover ball potatoes two choices you can get a fork and sort of mash the potato and get it nice and light and fluffy or this little gadget it's called a ricer i suppose it's a posh word for a potato masher just squeeze gently you can see how nice and light it is almost like fluffy little strands of potato you can do this when the potatoes are hot it'll go through the rice so much quicker just slice that off there now a nice spoon of okata ring a little touch of salt and pepper it's really important to season the mixture as we go along otherwise the nokia becomes really bland flour over the ricotta sieved so there's no lumps one delicious egg give that a little whisk now make a little well in the center you want a nice soft pliable ball of dough give that a really good mix get some thyme flowers in there and this time is light fragrant and it's just a really nice herb and with the ricotta it tastes brilliant just pick the little tips the time flowers next flour your hands generously and knead the mixture into a dough fold in and push and basically what it's doing is get it nice and smooth as it starts to get a little bit wet and just add a little touch of flour we want something really nice and soft now don't overwork it it stops the nokia from expanding when it hits the pan that's exactly what i want a nice sort of soft fragrant ball cut the ball in half lightly flour the hands and just roll it gently just think of a big long cigar the mixture will start getting a little bit sort of wetter but do not add lots of flour now lightly flour the knife so when you slice the gnocchi it doesn't stick cut the dough into bite-sized pieces just take your finger dip it in the flour and push down why i want my nokia to look like a pillow and for me the most important part there is that not one of them are identically the same shape water on bring up to the boil little touch of olive oil in there lightly flour your hand lift up the gnocchi in to the rolling boiling water turn that pan to stop them from sticking at the bottom and let them simmer and they start to sort of tell you they're cooked when they start floating get a pan on get that nice and hot now they're just starting to come up to the top and you can continue cooking them like that i like blanching them in the water taking them out and then frying them to study the gnocchi heat olive oil in a frying pan gently lift up and look they've doubled in size drain it get rid of the excess water and straight in to the hot pan [Music] this is where they start to take on a completely different texture nice crisp sauteed texture on the outside nokia loves fresh pepper so pepper in and see as i start turning them i've got this really nice little sort of brown color and they're almost popping up now like little parcels so i want them nice and sauteed both sides but light and creamy in the center fresh garden peas in and the butter gives it a really nice sort of bernoulli flavor on the end beautiful a little bit of fresh thyme over the peas and then finally i want to lift it up fresh lemon zest the lemon over [Music] smells incredible and then finally seal the deal with a touch of grated parmesan cheese give your vegetable attitude and you'll get amazingly elegant dishes on a budget that are always guaranteed to impress what more do you want from great cooking cheap to make easy to cook and absolutely stunning cooking great food doesn't mean you have to spend a fortune on fancy equipment get some basic essentials and you'll be set in the kitchen saucepans i mean basically you don't need a collection of ten all you need really is two a medium size one followed by a large one a small pan is great for sauces heating liquids or rice whereas your large pan gives you space perfect for pastas stews or when you're cooking in bulk which keeps costs down made from copper to stainless steel find what's right for you and always get a lid which helps heat the pan up as quickly as possible and the secret behind a great saucepan is the heavier the bottom the more heat it will conduct the thinner the bottom the more chance you've got actually burning your food buy the best saucepans you can afford take good care of them and they'll last you years saving you money in the long run amazing recipes don't necessarily have to include meat cooking vegetarian dishes will reduce your food bills without compromising on taste and flavor here are three more recipes to satisfy even the keenest carnivore like me that will max out on veg and won't break the bang [Applause] starting with spicy black beans with feta and avocado [Music] first in a pan heat olive oil add chopped onion and fry until soft then finely slice garlic and chili add cumin cinnamon and black beans then combined cooked together until deliciously soft these small beans come dried or in tins and they're a great cheap ingredient to make dishes more substantial to serve dollop the black bean mixture on crunchy tortillas topped with cubed ripe avocado chopped fresh coriander and crumbled salty feta cheese spicy black beans with feta an avocado a dish has filling frugal and tastes fantastic my next great veg recipe is leaking green rusty with fried [Music] eggs in a hot pan sweat shredded leeks along with a knob of

is how to cook amazing food on a budget next up my guide to getting the best ingredients for your money my shopping mantra is simple first rely on your senses make sure whatever you're buying that it looks smells and really feels good second is to recognize that knowledge is crucial the more you know personally about where your ingredients are from and how they produce the better so don't be scared ask lots of questions and learn [Music] and when it comes to buying potatoes a great ingredient if you're cooking on a budget one green grocer who can always spot a duds bud is borough market royalty fred foster it's all about flavour it's all about choosing the right variety for the right dish he's been selling top quality veg for over 15 years and really knows his king edwards from his duke of yorks basically there's two types of potatoes there's early season and a main crop potato early season is basically round about may time you can't store them they cannot be stored you have to buy them and use them within two to three days when you're buying an early season potato you must avoid green looking potatoes at all costs it really is important and the way you can tell that is if you just brush the potato the skin comes off really really easy and then you want you want a yellowy or whitey looking potato the new seasoned potato is a superb potato to use new season types include rocket home guard and marist bard but my favorite is the classic jersey royal it has a delicate sweet flavor it's packed with vitamin c and is great in salads or simply boiled and mixed with olive oil and fresh mint jersey potatoes early crop are phenomenal look at that keep the skin on it's really important just wash it boil it it's a beautiful beautiful potato and that's what we're talking about we're talking about i know it's a potato i know it's a bit sad but we're talking about flavour right then what is a main crop potato it's the crop that is grown specifically for nine months of the year use when you're looking at a main crop potato you need to see that the eyes aren't too large because they tend to go right through the potato they've got to be firm it's very very important if a potato in any way feels a little bit soft discard it storage wise dark place cool place dry place and that will last until you eat it simple as that both early season and main crop potatoes come in two main types waxy and flowery waxy potatoes have a smooth dense flesh and because they're low in starch they stay firm when cooked types include anya and pink fur but i love charlotte which has an amazing buttery taste and a great sauteed in stews or serves whole with roast chicken flowery potatoes have a fluffy dry texture when cooked which makes them great for mashing roasting or cutting into chips types include king edward whose smooth creamy flesh is perfect for potato gratins or with rich meats like beef and desiree which have an amazing red skin and are great for bacon or as delicious potato wedges old-fashioned types known as heritage potatoes are now widely available and have fantastic colours and distinctive tastes that are great when you want something different this one's called salad blue when you cut it you then see the most amazing color and it's perfect it looks stunning on the plate are really popular it's so important when you're going out to pick your potatoes you already know in advance what you're going to do with that potato so whether you're going to put it in a salad whether it's a masher or a chipper or even a baking potato each variety has a unique flavor fred's spot on whether new season main crop waxy or flowery potatoes are incredibly versatile and packed with great flavor the perfect ingredient when you're cooking on a budget well how much do i love potatoes well cook them simply proper flavors it doesn't get any better [Music] like all chefs for me there's nothing better than seasonal produce at its peak when fruit and veg is fresh in season and fantastically ripe i can't wait to get back in the kitchen to get the most out of your cooking always use ingredients in their prime my next recipe is a proper british classic that's super simple to cook and cost next to nothing a delicious apple crumble crumbles are the perfect way to use fruit when it's in season there's lots of it about it's nice and cheap but most importantly the fruit's at its absolute best first off i'm gonna make a really nice light caramel pan on nice and low great to apples [Music] and this helps to almost sort of puree the apples so much quicker there's a lot of flavor in the skin so don't worry about peeling the fruit whether it's pears plums peaches flavors in the skin nice to start the caramel a couple of tablespoons of sugar the sugar helps to get rid of the tartness in the apple a touch of cinnamon that starts to make it a little spicy open up your vanilla just scrape out all those seeds now this just makes it light and fragrant all those seeds in to the sugar when making caramel be patient and always swirl the dish instead of stirring it when the sugar goes brown add the apple that starts to sort of cool down the caramel but it gives it a really nice sort of caramelized puree apple's almost disintegrating smells incredible turn the gas down slice up two apples it's a crumble that's got no frills straight forward no faffing around no peening of the skin i want them to sort of stand out from the caramel apples in now those nice thick chunks of apple sort of almost bedding itself into the puree dried cranberries gives it that nice sort of shock in the texture sweet and chewy i want it to sort of taste zesty spicy so sit the lemon zest on top of your apples and cranberry fresh lemon juice over and that just gives that extra acidic kick takes the cranberries the apples the caramel and the cinnamon to another level turn the gas off so that that sits and let's concentrate on the crumble flour in a couple of tablespoons of demerara sugar sugar helps to get the topping nice and crispy butter in [Music] give that a nice little rub what we're looking for is like a a bread crumb mixture lightly season it with a touch of cinnamon and the demerara sugar sort of helps to get a nice fine crumble mix and it stops the butter from sort of melting in that flour so that's the basic crumble mix but i'm not finished yet muesli two-thirds crumble one-third muesli mix that in if you haven't got muesli then crunchy granola works brilliantly too lovely now start off in the center and work your way around i want the crispiness on the top the puree on the bottom of the caramel and then the texture in the center a good tip turn the gas back on i want it bubbling before it goes in the oven because then you just got to cook the top so as soon as you see that caramel starting to bubble down the side and she goes let's go bake at 200 degrees celsius for 12 to 14 minutes until golden brown smells amazing beautiful still bubbling [Music] and look at it a delicious but very simple crumble with apples at their absolute best beautiful [Music] next my tricks of the trade and kitchen tips first up cooking pasta a great budget basic to keep in the cupboard it can be easily undercooked or overcooked here's how to do it properly first water in nice large pan to make sure the pasta's got sufficient room to cook evenly nicely seasoned absolutely crucial olive oil in that stops the pasta from sticking together bring it up to the ball that's the rolling boil the secret there it stops the pasta from sticking together and it gently rolls it around now this is angel pasta nice thin pasta takes three and a half to four minutes so into the pan as it hits the water it melts and then you turn it round tongs as that starts to melt gently twist that into the pan bring it back up to the boil if you're bad at timing then set a timer beautiful to test it lift a little strand and you can actually feel it with your fingers it's still nice and firm al dente not a bite not a strong bite but just really nice and firm inside definitely not crunchy and then into a colander drain the pasta in a light seasoning salt and pepper a tablespoon of olive oil mix that through that stops it from sticking together and look there you go beautiful pasta al dente and cooked perfectly a tip for making the most of spare bread blitz leftovers into breadcrumbs great for stuffing or crab cakes or cut into chunks and freeze for perfect croutons on demand or simply tear a news in a delicious rustic salad dried pulses like chickpeas or lentils are great for soups and stews and cost pennies but don't season them until the end of the cooking or the salt makes them go tough for perfect boiled potatoes always start them off in cold water and never boiling water this way by the time the centers of the potatoes are cooked the outside won't be falling apart and when you're cooking potatoes always cook extra so there's leftovers they're fantastic to have on hand for making my delicious gnocchi and potato rusties for a classic bubbling squeak [Music] [Applause] [Music] follow my ultimate cookery course packed with

bucks doesn't have to be complex this dish is as fun to cook as it is to eat [Music] one of the keys to keeping it simple is to prepare all the ingredients in advance the more organized you are in the kitchen the easier cooking becomes here are three of my favorite quick recipes that with a bit of advanced preparation are so simple to make [Music] [Applause] [Music] starting with my easy fragrant fried rice first get prepped chopped garlic ginger and chili keeping the seeds for extra kick slice spring onions chopped spring greens and trim ahead of broccoli then whisk two eggs prep done stir

the eggs spring onions and a dash of fish sauce [Music] scramble then mix season [Applause] top with lime and spring onions [Music] my fragrant fried rice made simple with advanced prep and ready in five minutes my next recipe it pays to get prepped for is garlic and saffron mayonnaise [Music] first get your ingredients to hand eggs should be out of the fridge and at room temperature soak saffron in warm water saffron is the most expensive spice in the world made from the dried stigma of crocus flowers but even a pinch gives a fantastic taste and a wonderful colour next separate three eggs put the yolks into a mixing bowl add dijon mustard finely chopped garlic the drained saffron and a squeeze of lemon then mix whisking constantly add oil slowly it won't take forever for perfect flavor use half olive oil and half vegetable oil when the mayonnaise comes together season [Music] a smooth thick consistency means it's done top with saffron rich delicious and perfect with everything from seafood to sandwiches and chips my second recipe garlic and saffron mayonnaise easy to get right as long as you've planned ahead my final dish that's a cinch to cook with a little advanced prep work is mussels with celery and chili first prep the veg chopped spring onions shallots a clove of garlic and chili to taste then thinly slice celery add a bay leaf and thyme veg ready [Music] add oil to a pan and fry [Music] season then add mussels and stir muscles one of my favorite shellfish cheap healthy and delicious cover and sting for a couple of minutes as the muscles open add vermouth and aromatic 45 wine [Music] and 150ml of dry white wine on a high heat reduce the liquid to create a source discard any mussels that are still shut then finish with creme fresh and chopped parsley [Music] minimal prep and cooked in less than 10 minutes my muscles with celery and chili impressive affordable and super speedy make it simple in the kitchen by prepping your ingredients in advance and i promise you'll find these three recipes a pleasure to make amazing [Music] you don't need to spend a fortune on masses of kitchen equipment this is my quick guide to kitchen knives basically three knives a heavy duty chopping knife followed by a small paring knife which is brilliant for prepping vegetables and then this baby here a serrated edge knife for carving and slicing basically that is it before you buy a knife hold it in your hand and make sure it feels right for you the secret behind a great set of knives is in the handle if you're comfortable holding the handle your cutting can be so much easier the firmer the grip the better the chopping the heavier the handle the more control you've got over the blade with these three knives you can't go wrong welcome back to my ultimate cookery course [Music] this is my guide to keeping it simple my next recipe is easy and a pleasure to make if you're organized with everything ready in advance [Music] miso poached salmon with asian vegetables organization is key in the kitchen take a couple of minutes before you start and set yourself up make sure you know where everything is stock spatula pan etc it becomes less stressful but more importantly the end results are incredible [Music] first off get your pan on whisk and stock start off with this amazing fermented soy bean puree into the pan three nice tablespoons gas on now get your fish stock and whisk into the puree be generous with the stock you want this nice light broth basically you can buy miso paste from big supermarkets and it works brilliantly with salmon poaching the salmon in the miso stuff gives it a really nice sort of sweet earthy creamy flavor it's incredible bring up to the bowl i'm going to infuse the broth and make it a little bit more fragrant kaffir lime leaf is very lemony inside the miso broth then chopped chili chili's in and finely sliced ginger that's simmering beautifully now we're gonna poach the salmon poaching means cooking it in liquid but it's cooked gently and the secret here is to keep that salmon skin on if we took the skin off now the salmon can actually break up whilst it's poaching skin side down i'm just going to slide that in under nice the minute that stock starts boiling turn it down let it simmer take a little ladle and just every couple of minutes pour over that makes sure the top of the salmon is cooked evenly and keeps it nice and moist and poaching is one of the most delicate ways of cooking so you have to handle it with care whilst the salmon's poaching in the miso broth start preparing your vegetables i'm using tender stem broccoli and bak choy i always like to cook the leaf and the stem separately the leaf is like sort of spinach and the stem is so much thicker it's almost as thick as a stick of celery so i like to get the stems sliced just so i've got that nice sort of christmas place the leaves together nicely roll them up nice and tight and then slice them down now my salmon already the flavor in that broth has been elevated now it tastes really fishy got the heat the chili spiciness the ginger and the caffeine lime leaf take your fish slice and place it very gently underneath the salmon and push it down fish slices are flexible for that reason bend it lift it up just touch looking for a springy firm texture and just sit there on top and it will touch the broth over it it stops it from drying out leave that to cool down for two minutes bring the stock back up to the boil broccoli and bak choy stems in a little taste it's getting better and better and better cook the broccoli and the bok choy stems for one minute and then add the tops in turn the salmon into your hand and just peel all that skin off the skin also helps to keep the salad nice and moist then gently flake the salmon that's the secret behind poaching everything just stays so moist wonderful long shards of pink now just before we serve we're going to add our mushrooms these are enoki mushrooms you can buy these enoki mushrooms in big supermarkets and good grocers slice them off i'm going to put half in and the other half i'm gonna serve with the salmon toasted sesame seed oil put a little drip in there just rub and you're just lining almost like a little coat of varnish start off with your mushrooms and then my salmon four nice layers and then finally the mushrooms top with the vegetables and then finally a nice ladle that beautiful really sumptuous rich stock lovely and that is an amazing misu poached salmon soup simplify your cooking by getting organized and amazing food will be coming out your kitchen every day and for great food you need great ingredients [Music] next up my shopping guide to getting the finest fish when i buy my fish i only want the freshest and the best and if anyone knows how to get the best it's roger kent barbara he's been buying and selling fish at the world famous billings gate market in london for over 50 years i love fish i think it's the greatest food of all time i sell literally every variety there is i could feed you a different fish 365 days a year this guy really knows how to sniff out the good from the bad all fish smell different the longer it's around the more fishy it will smell when it's lovely and fresh it doesn't smell whenever you're gonna buy fish don't be frightened get your nose right into it don't go like that get it into it smell it smells delightful it smells what i call salmony and it's lovely barramundi it's a lovely fish the way to tell good fish is look at it closely it's shining it's still got the bloom on it his eyes are as bright as yours look in the gill lovely and red put it in a bag for the gentleman please people should always be asking about their fish what kind of fish is it where does it come from a nice salmon 19 pound it's a bargain at 20 pounds roger's right salmon's brilliant value and a great all-rounder really healthy and super delicious here's a quick look at the different cuts and how to use them [Music] whole salmon always impresses it's fantastic stuffed and steamed either in a fish kettle or in the oven wrapped in foil steaks are great value and brilliant baked a cider salmon is perfect for poaching home curing or baking in pastry the fillet is so versatile easy fast to cook and great for pan frying smoked salmon delicious cooked or raw i love it with scrambled eggs [Music] broadly there's white fish and there's oily fish they come under two different sections here we have white fish it's lovely it's cold it's the best cot in the world it comes to a place called peterhead it's nice and white the whiter the better one of the most oily fish you'll find mackerel there it is lovely color with most fish the fresher they are the harder they are if you're not well and you're ill have a mackerel sprats otherwise known as top hats here we have flat fish and these are known as place as you can see they've got spots the redder they are the fresher they are it really is a lovely fish to eat king jules couldn't have better for fish fresh enough for royalty follow your fishmonger's advice and you'll never ever have another dodgy dover sole again [Music] next my tricks of the trade and kitchen tips first how to chop an onion this is the root that's absolutely crucial leave that on there if you cut that off the onion will start to bleed and you'll start crying rapidly slice going forward let the weight of the knife do the work three fingers one in front two behind and this part of the knuckle is going to guide the knife fingers on top of the onion point the knife towards the root and try to get as close to the root as possible nice long stroke and then push the onion back together push the knife halfway in to the onion slightly tilt the knife down one at the top and then gripping the onion like a tennis ball holding it together in place with the weight of the blade to cut through that onion to get to the base of the root again turn it round up and down motion and that's what we're left there no waste just the root and look there you've got a really nice finely chopped onion so much great cooking depends on starting with a high enough heat if a recipe calls for a hot pan put it on early so it gets smoking hot and always remember to preheat your oven at least 20 minutes before cooking clean cook is an efficient cook my tip for a tidy cooking area is to always have a waste bowl next to you it saves you going back and forth to the bin never add salt to eggs before cooking them because it ruins the texture and dulls the colour instead save your seasoning to the very end [Music] the key to cooking meat is to make sure it's at room temperature before you begin cook straight from the fridge the mussel fibers will be tight which results in tough meat and always let it rest afterwards so relax is becoming tender and juicy [Music] follow my ultimate cookery course crammed with key lessons top tips and 100 recipes to

are when you slice so don't worry about the speed just let the knife do the work and take your time speed comes the most important thing is to get your technique right red onion now sweet sour peppers olive oil in [Music] i'm going to saute them which is just the chef's turn for shallow frying on a high heat for maximum taste some salt and pepper add a tablespoon of sugar sugar helps to break down the peppers quicker but caramelize the onions frying them in a frying pan perfect it's one of the sort of basic essential tools of any kitchen because it's so multi-purpose great for sauteing tossing

speeding up the cooking process at the same time i'm keeping the pork chop really nice and moist and now look at the color of that butter it's almost like sort of a nut brown check the color on the other side useful when they're that thick three and a half to four minutes each side 30 seconds from now they're going to be medium so i'm going to take them out and let them rest the secret to

coming up on my ultimate cookery course along with 100 recipes to stake your life on i'm going to give you 100 quick cooking tips to make your life in the kitchen easier first up how to keep your knife sharp it's far harder working in the kitchen with a blunt knife than it is with a sharp knife the secret behind keeping a sharp knife sharpen it before and every time you use it first grip the steel feel really comfortable about holding the still imagine you're holding a tennis racket or you're playing squash you've got to be really comfortable with it now 45 degrees confident grip confident grip with the knife this is the butt of the steel really important you keep your fingers behind there you never grip a steel with your fingers over that because the knife comes back in you've just lost a finger always grip behind nice long strokes so we get the whole of the blade over still stroke and we start from the bottom to the top so there across there across slow strokes over the top of the steel and then come back underneath then back in the knees it is so dangerous working in the kitchen with a blunt knife you can cause so much damage working with a sharp knife is 10 times quicker more efficient now that's ready to start chopping to stop your chopping board rocking or slipping a great tip is to simply wet a kitchen cloth kitchen paper or tea towel and place it underneath now you can chop with confidence [Music] my next top tip is get the most out of your humble veg peeler it's brilliant for slicing ultra thin ribbons or veg perfect for asian dishes great for making long delicate parmesan shavings to top soups and salads it also makes wonderful chocolate curls your pepper mill is more versatile than you might think tighten the top screw to get finely ground pepper ideal for soups and sauces [Music] for general seasoning you want it medium ground so set the screw in the middle and loosen it right off for coarse pepper perfect for steaks and fish

simply pick out the peeled cloves [Music] this is my ultimate cookery course 100 recipes to stake your life on i'll be showing you a roast chicken recipe to die for hold the drum and slice straight through but first like any good chef i'm always looking to get great ingredients at the right price my shopping mantra is simple first rely on your senses make sure whatever you're buying it looks smells and really feels good and if you get the chance taste it before you buy it second is to recognize that knowledge is crucial the more you know about where your ingredients come from and how they produce the better so ask lots of questions and learn you're never too old to learn from experts and when it comes to buying great birds one person knows what to look for is award-winning fifth generation master butcher danny lid gain poultry is a great meat because there's many different types of birds it's worth tasting the variation of flavours between different birds to birds is massive turkey's a great lean meat that's available all year round not just for christmas anybody who's worried about eating fatty meats it's a really healthy flavoursome meal game birds people don't try them often enough once they're shot they're hung up for a little while but a few days at least it means the meat's going to be more tender it all adds flavor to the birds we've got a wood pigeon and a red leg partridge both really good and cook really quickly when you're buying a chicken some of the things to look out for is obviously the smell and when you're smelling a good quality chicken you can tell the difference the skin's a nice white color and it smells like a fresh chickeny smell when you're buying from a good butcher you'll find you tend to get the giblets as well which is basically the neck and other organs this is great for making gravy once you have cooked it you can use all the offcuts for other things stir fries curries pasta dishes save the bones use the bones for stocks and soups they're really packed full of flavor and remember there are lots of different breeds of chicken all have different characteristics and flavors so shop around and find the ones you love here are three of my all-time favorites the label anglais these come from an old british breed they've got smaller breasts but the meat's delicious the black leg a fantastic french variety succulent with bags of flavour and really meaty thighs and the pulley device this is the rolls royce of chickens rich gamey and delicious one for special occasions i think people should maybe try and buy less meat but aim for the best quality you're only going to get out what you put in by putting the best quality into a dish you're going to get the best results no matter how seasoned the chef you are there are always new ingredients and recipes to get fired up about so if a tired old recipe is getting you down spice it up with fresh ideas and flavors my next recipe is an old classic roast chicken but with a simple twist it takes on a new life and it's guaranteed to impress one of the things i love about cooking and that keeps me excited after 25 years behind the stove is that there's always something new to learn every day new ingredients new techniques and new cuisines start off with the stuffing it's amazing how exciting a stuffed roast chicken can be because it keeps the chicken incredibly moist and gives a delicious texture inside the bird i'm going to start off with cured cerrito this is a traditional spanish sausage and it's garlicky spicy incredibly meaty that gives a little bit of sort of richness to the stuffing get our chriso in start cooking that down and getting all those oils out a little touch of olive oil in there to get it going right onions chopped add the onions to the cerezo and in a matter of seconds they'll change color as they soak up all the flavor that lovely spiciness has been stolen from that sausage now the onions smell incredible garlic garlicky fresh thyme just hold it down and put your fingers on there and it's a really nice way of taking off all those nice fragrant little time flowers you can hear it crackling in the background these are cannellini beans they're waxy very soft not so delicious but very dense but for stuffing they're so robust nothing breaks down drain them off in they're going to take on all that juice as well from the freezer i'm going to season them now because they're very dense so it needs some help i mean that looks like it's a dish on its own good enough to eat now i want to sweeten things up a little bit tomatoes half dried in that sweetens up the stuffing beautiful the stuffing's ready look at the color everything looks spanish it looks delicious now stuffing the chicken i like taking off these little knuckles as the chicken cooks the skin stretches over the bone you can get a really nice drum and take off those little wing tips as well salt pepper so important now you're stuffing i'm gonna go right inside the chicken push it down this really helps to cook the bird evenly because you're pushing out all the empty spaces in the carcass and take a nice large lemon push the lemon in pick up the person's nose pull the skin over olive oil on top salt and pepper a teaspoon of paprika sprinkle it on and then get your hands and sort of rub that in let's see what the paprika is doing to the chicken putting this like sweet spicy marinade it's not even roasted yet but it looks delicious [Music] 400ml of white wine same quantity of water that helps the chicken to steam chicken in be generous with the time sprigs [Music] make sure the fall is folded tightly around the roasting tray so the chicken steams in the oven keeping it moist and juicy into the oven [Music] cook for one hour at 180 degrees with a foil on nice take it out and remove the full lid then give it another 30 minutes to crisp up that skin [Music] look at that it's so important to make sure you take that tin foil off with half an hour to go beautiful pierce that open squeeze it in that delicious gravy mix that into the tray and sieve that that's really nice fragrant lemony spiced roasting juices to finish before we cut up the chicken take out amazing stuffing [Music] incredible i'd have that with chicken over potatoes any day and then just get your chicken roasting juices now to cut the chicken up hold the drum and slice straight through and there's a wonderful drum and the thigh through the wishbone off slice with the point at an angle so you can see the texture of that amazing rice chicken just

mulch for this salad inspired by my travels across thailand i'm starting by making a wonderfully spicy paste a little salt in there in just break them up this paste is like a staple ingredient in thailand that's what we're looking for almost it's like a powder right next just one clove of garlic slice up the garlic and get that into the pest and water bird's eye chili incredibly hot powerful but wow it does give an amazing kick to the paste in to the mix now a couple of tablespoons of brown caster sugar that softens the blow with a chili and then just to give that nice sour taste a little bit of hot water into this tamarind paste it's really tart but sweet paste one tablespoon in fish sauce now it's got that almost sort of pickly smell slightly salty but the flavor is intense two tablespoons and bring that together and give it a really good mix some lime juice in half another touch of tartness the pace is nice and thick and fragrant but it's got the heat the sourness the tartness incredible green papaya stand it up and give it a little peel you can find green papaya and local asian shops and bigger supermarkets and as it doesn't weld like more delicate veg it's perfect for robust salads like this i grate it look that's what i want these thin slithers next a nice rich sweet banana shalom [Music] nice some carrot carrot gives it another texture now little that and mix it [Music] finish that off with thai basil and fresh coriander thai basil is a much more fragrant basil it's stronger and it's slightly thicker as well like papaya and tamarind paste you can get thai basil in good supermarkets and independent asian stores but normal basil works well too next prepare the crunchy topping pan on and toast some peanuts chop the nuts but it gives a really nice crunch in they go roll them around the pan gas off and just stick them out now for the exciting palm we're gonna dress the salad nice spoon of dressing in to the papaya mix that in and then finally a nice general sprinkling roasted nuts and that is one delicious very fragrant very robust green papaya salad so easy to make and guaranteed not to go limp a perfect party salad and with such incredible colors textures and bold exciting flavors it's sure to grab your guests attention spicy chutney with chutney standing by in the fridge you can always add that special little touch to a simple supper prove that thinking ahead always pays off pan on start toasting those spices keep the pan nice and low cumin very aromatic very fragrant and it's almost like a light spice next nice little coriander seeds coriander in now you're going to get a bit of heat in the chutney mustard seeds well smaller than coriander seeds but so much more powerful mustard seeds in now curry leaves they don't actually smell much dry but the flavor they give off is extraordinary coli's in really important not to burn them otherwise you'll have that bitter taste across the chutney keep the gas nice and low the secret is sort of toasting them so it releases that oil and intensifies the spice touch of salt and then a couple of small powerful chilies keep them whole no one's going to eat them but it gives that real nice burst of heat now let them toast gently there we're not gonna chop the onion we're gonna grate it why because it sort of breaks down to a really nice puree in the chutney when you grate it hold the root in the palm of your hand and just push nice long grates i want those nice long shards look i've almost got a nice sort of onion puree but it's nice and clear a touch of olive oil spices nicely toasted onions in [Music] three nice cloves of garlic lightly crushed some [Music] lay it nice and flat and just slice the garlic nice thin slices garlic in your time to get the owners caramelised beautifully will really reap rewards in the long run tamarind paste and sugar in with the sugar first three nice tablespoons of sugar that will give a really nice syrup effect sort of nice rich syrupy texture to the chutney tamarind paste you can get tamarind paste in most delis and the big supermarkets it's really nice thickening asian but it gives that tartness the chutney and it's sort of rich sugary spicy next in with my coconut add four nice tablespoons that'll give a nice body and a really nice texture to the chutney cook that coconut out and now add the carrot grated the carrot just gives the chutney really nice sort of crunch but also helps to sort of cool down the spice carrots in the water comes out the carrot flavors the chutney beautifully but gives that nice sort of vibrant bright color to it as well and grating it almost sort of it cooks instantly but i want a bit of texture through here turn down the gas and just let that simmer for five minutes if the carrots aren't that moist and juicy then put a couple of tablespoons of water in there to help it along now just cook that out for five minutes just as those carrots start going nice and soft don't overcook them you want that nice texture in there slightly spicy slightly sweet gas off keep those chillies in there for that it's beautiful nice and gooey delicious and ready to go in his jar as that sits in the fridge just gets better and better and better i love to eat this chutney with cold meats or even cold fish but with ham it's amazing it's a really nice way of living up the ham just sort of roll it up get a nice spoon of chutney i mean it looks fantastic chutney onto the plate and serve and that is a nice little gem in the fridge that is worth prepping in advance for vietnamese style fresh prawn rolls one of the keys to cooking for crowds is creating the atmosphere and that buzz getting your guests to sort of almost get involved and dip in and dip out this is an exciting fragrant wrap that is so easy to do first off soak the noodles these are thin glass noodles basically bring the kettle up to the boil and just pour just let them steep there for a couple of minutes the noodles are for my prawn rolls as they soak i'm gonna make a spicy dipping sauce to go with them start off with sugar we're trying to create that sweet sour salty but a really nice sort of heated sauce as well rice wine vinegar that will dissolve the sugar fish sauce now that's going to give it its saltiness next the chili i want the seeds left in because i want some power chilli in a little bit of garlic don't need to chop it too finely just slice it take a spring onion just top and tail them slice slices bring it in nice and thinly so it sort of almost permeates that dipping sauce i grew up with the love of spring rolls but on the back of my visit to vietnam it sort of transformed my respect for a spring roll give that a little mix a little bit of coriander and fresh mint roll them up and chop herbs in there's no olive oil in there there's no cream there's no butter it's just a really nice light dipping sauce and wow all those senses going on now we're gonna make the filling for the wraps a really nice fresh noodle salad rinse the noodles in cold water then chop them into bite-sized lengths prawns peeled and cooked slice them up the prawns give a really nice sweetness next the vegetables i want crunch freshness texture baby gem lettuce and just shred that lettuce next spring onion the good news about these wraps is that you can make them up in advance sit them in the fridge and then take them out literally seconds before your guests arrive peel the carrot so you got really nice fresh crunchy carrot now fresh mint fresh basil and fresh coriander together sounds a little bit bizarre but it tastes amazing don't hold back with the herbs they'll really help make the filling vibrant fresh and aromatic finally touch a lime just squeeze that fresh lime juice over there a couple of tablespoons of your dipping sauce don't put too much in there it just makes all the filling too wet just give that a really good mix that's a very quick simple salad to eat now but let's get it into a wrap now take your rice paper wrap literally 30 seconds in warm water you can get rice paper wraps from your local asian supermarket or buy them online gently lift it out of the water there beautiful lay it carefully onto your board place the mixture at the bottom don't over fill it because it'll be a nightmare to roll fold them over first nice and tightly halfway then tuck in the ends and make sure nothing's coming out the sides beautiful it's so light fragrant incredibly simple to do and there you go a very delicious fragrant asian wrap certainly different to the chinese spring rolls i grew up with you

From Boiled eggs with anchovy soldiers, a Ploughman's lunch with beer bread loaves to an incredible Stuffed rib of beef with horseradis...",2022-11-29 22:16:02.926159, there's something quite nostalgic about a bald egg it's something that's never lost it's magic when you slice that top off and dunk that soldier into the yolk [Music] an anchovy soldier anchovies interpersonal water no salt naturally yeah anchovies are very salty so just a touch of pepper grind them it's a really nice smooth paste the smell of that is almost like being at the seaside now get your soft butter and just put half the butter in first 50 50 is the way 50 percent anchovy 5010 butter that way got that real nice salty creaminess mix that up that's absolutely delicious trust me finishing that anchovy butter on a slice of grilled fish i'm in heaven the bread this is a sourdough delicious very crusty take four nice slices now get that pan nice and hot a couple of tablespoons of that anchovy oil into the pan and then get your bread and lightly fry each side the smell of the anchovy oil is incredible take that out now bring your water up to the boil the secret of softly boiling an egg is to place them into the water gently on a spoon in and just tilt so they don't hit the bottom nice and light up to the boil count to five turn the gas down is it four and a half minutes is it five minutes for a softball day i've cooked thousands of them and every time it's four and a half minutes whilst that's boiling get your bread and spread that on there that is incredible chopped parsley brings that kind of freshness goes brilliantly well with the anchovies hear that crunch on i'm sorry but i can't resist oh my god right gas off one beauty in two i feel like a five-year-old again this is that moment when you open the vault and that little magic inside is all yours there's a great twist on a great classic wow [Music] who would have thought that egg and soldiers could be that delicious [Music] a fish becomes a classic because it's delicious and somehow strikes a cord with us it just works sometimes these dishes can become tired but a clever twist helps make them fresh again [Music] like plum ones with the most amazing but super simple beer baked bread hearty and full of flavor [Music] salt is really important for bread it's the first thing i do once i've cracked it and smelt you want to smell that salt baked throughout beer in about 250 mils of beer [Music] the reason why this recipe works so well is it the beer it's got that yeast so naturally it's gonna work beautifully give that a really good mix i'm looking for the mixture to be quite wet if the dough becomes too firm then it's gonna cook dry in the center just as it starts to fall through the whisk that is perfect beautiful small tins give it that kind of intimacy and i quite like having my own little loaf give the moulds a really nice lining with butter make sure you butter the top now a tablespoon of flour dust inside the mold that will stop your mixture sticking tap out any excess three quarters fill your little molds we're going to allow it to sort of rise just so it comes above the mold and forms this really nice miniature loaf onto the tray a centimeter apart into the oven 25 to 30 minutes at 180. something quite nice about the smell of home baked bread in the kitchen delicious red onion is a lot sweeter less harsh than a white onion the early days of ones you've got those ghastly sharp pickled onions that make you almost cry when you're crunching them i'm gonna lightly pickle my red onion just push your fingers through so you get these nice sort of onion rings a little touch of salt a little sprinkle of sugar and then a couple of cloves in there that gives a really nice sort of perfume and sort of makes the pickling slightly more mellow red wine vinegar now if you haven't got red wine vinegar white wine vinegar it's just as good but red matches the red onion so it goes hand in glove a couple of tablespoons of vinegar just give that a really good mix [Music] as the weight presses down on the onions the clove the salt the sugar the vinegar worked their magic and it comes out with a really nice light fragrant pickle [Music] [Music] now generally it's sort of three parts oil to one part vinegar that's the sort of general [Music] base hmm you don't really think of a vinaigrette with a plan ones but this is a really nice sort of modern approach to plan ones [Music] if i was making a watercress soup i'd use the stalks but the stalks are a little bit bitter so i just grabbed them like that pinch them and then twist [Music] very peppery very hot but so juicy watercress in your celery chop it nice and finely it's the one thing that everybody leaves is that stick of celery so scatter it amongst the sellers [Music] before it comes out i'm going to glaze the top with a little touch of milk that will put a really nice finish to the bread back in for the last five minutes now for the magic and the plain ones generally you'll see it as a ham or cheddar or stilton flour it's hard to dictate which one's the best [Music] brilliant peel some nice shards of that delicious creamy cheddar just get them dancing on top the dressing drizzle ran in circles and then finally our delicious lightly pickled onions give them a good squeeze and look just dot the onions around bread it's ready it's got that nice yeasty smell warm crusty and delicious there you go that is my classic modern version of a traditional stunning playerman's wow [Music] to make the most out of my roast my main course is the delicious stuffed roast rib of beef complete with tangy horseradish yorkshire puddings [Music] but first i'm enlisting the help of my eldest 15 year old megan to reinvent one of my all-time favorite classic desserts eaton mess bomb right eat a mess what's the one thing you love about is a mess i love the meringues now this is a eaten mess with a twist what's the twist in it compared to the normal one we're gonna freeze it so it's almost like a sort of eaten mess bomb wow now i'd like you to whisk the cream please half the strawberries are going to go through the mix and half the strawberries are going to be turned into a coulis strawberries in first a little dusting of icing sugar into the pan and now the icing sugar will withdraw the sweetness from the strawberries and start caramelizing so let me show you a nice quick way of whisking secret whisking is like 10 seconds on and 10 seconds off that way your arms don't get tired now i'm going to take the cream to a three-quarter stage what is a three-quarter mix so we leave some sort of texture in the cream and that's what we call three-quarter whip you've got a nice soft peak they're caramelized there you go we'll put a little touch of water in there that'll help break down the sugar and turn that into a really nice strawberry liquid now to get it really nice and fine i'm gonna blend it on and blitz off okay that's fine i want you to use the back of the spoon and push that through the sieve okay now that way you don't get those seeds it smells so good i love this now nice this is the exciting part wow hold up oh mag megan right now the meringue with your fingers just crush and flake the meringue into the cream how big should i crush it dado there nice big chunks okay lovely oh you okay yeah got me wrangling my eye damn to make this dessert even easier i often cheat by using good quality shop port meringues a little taste that's just cream and meringue wow it's a little tasty okay strawberries in next a couple of spoons of the cooling now look at that now to prepare the mold to transform the traditional eaten mess into a frozen bomb form a triple layer of clim film adding water to the bowl will help the cling film stick as i pour that in i want you to spread it down okay at the bottom and push it down can you hear that crunch yeah the line all right now fold the cling film over put that in the freezer please make young please in the freezer she goes [Music] dessert done now for our main course with a twist that is the rib eye we've had that in the fridge not wrapped so it sort of almost air dries and it intensifies the flavor gross so much quicker and there's less water in the beef for me the only downside to perfect roast dinner is the fight about who washes up afterwards so meg and i are going to avoid that by cooking everything in one roasting tin starting with the spinach and mushroom stuffing [Music] let's do it with a salt and pepper please here we go some of your left shoulder some left shoulder thank you in with the garlic and the mushrooms to toss the pan you push down and pull back down and push back off you go take your time push it down and flip very good that's it push down nicely that was lovely and again nice i'm gonna drop let's see well done well done well then right we're gonna sort of make a little well a little touch of butter in the middle now we need to start putting the spinach in the middle piece so you can push that down the spinach is cold so you're not going to burn yourself be confident in the pan toss it and you'll see it wilting and disintegrating away wow who would have thought all that spinach could fit in this pan because it's a very delicate leaf it sort of cooks so quickly put this all on your board now and then i just want you to go and give that a nice chop then when you're confident with one hand we need to pick up the other knife the other hand chop it nicely good now outside and come in gently good regroup and take your time yes mmm right i love that smell what is that lemon thyme lemon tan that's right so you get your little thyme stalks and you pour down you sort of strip lemon thyme in now tarragon it'll taste brilliant with the beef fantastic with chicken and fish roughly chop the tarragon and i sprinkle the fresh breadcrumbs so the breadcrumbs almost sort of bring the stuffing together next we're gonna get an egg yolk now with the beef this is the exciting part slice with the bone and then come inside and go two thirds of the way down hold that open for daddy salt and pepper and then look we pack our stuffing in there this is amazing it's incredible now just gently hold out there like that okay yeah i'll see you tomorrow what tying string around the rib will keep it all together during roasting not too tight if we tie it too tightly what happens the stuffing will come out that's right that's ready for roasting but we're going to protect it and sit it on a trivet so trivet basically is almost like a sort of little little bed a little bed that's right if you want to enjoy these delicious roast vegetables at their best make sure you remove them from the hot oven after 35 minutes and reheat before serving with your beef now a little mix for the top a couple of teaspoons of mustard powder in salt a couple of tablespoons of olive oil mix that in i'm gonna pour my mustard powder over the beef so this forms a really nice glaze my one pot roast dinner goes into a hot oven 15 minutes at 230 degrees then down to 170 degrees for another two hours for a delicious twist on traditional yorkshire puds i'm going to lace mine with fresh horseradish [Music] start with plain white flour in a bowl and crack in the eggs adding only half of your milk at this stage makes it much easier to whisk all the lumps out and if like me you like your puddings a little lighter and crispier add a dribble of cold water and add salt to season when you're happy your batter is lump free whisk in the remaining milk peel and grate horseradish and add a handful to the mix we can leave the batter to rest while we get the meat from the oven that is beautiful and this is where you really need to let it rest how long would you say to rest it for um i like to rest the meat for at least 20 minutes just the right amount of time for us to whack up the oven and to get our yorkshire puddings in i love using the rich dripping but vegetable all is a healthier option to get the fluffiest yorkshires your tray and fat must be piping hot for best results take your jug of batter to the oven and pour the mixture in there it takes just 15 minutes for our yorkshire puds to puff themselves up and turn a delicious golden brown with the yorkshire puddings on the way and the beef rested we can finish off the eater mess bomb run the bowl under the hot water twist and pull nice wow look at that beauty it's amazing sit that on to your plate now the finishing touches a drizzle of the remaining strawberry coulis i'm just going to pour this over amazing flavor and some grated mint chocolate and that is a nice twist on a classic eaten mess a delicious eat and mess bomb beautiful let's go baby please don't drop that baby meg please it's not around as much dessert sorted and the beef is ready to serve up lift that up place that onto the board parsnips parrots you can see why we kept them in half they've got all that flavor one beautiful big slice for daddy one for maggie and then on the side it's stuffing the stuffing a bit that's the best to die for now fantastic yorkshire amazingly beautiful mm-hmm that's for my daddy and that one that's for me beautiful roast beef with a twist wow [Music] these are my ultimate classics with a twist juicy river beef with horseradish spiked yorkshire puds and scrummy eaten mess bomb topped with strawberry coulis and mint chocolate you

Pre-order your copy of Ramsay in 10...",2022-11-29 22:16:02.926159, [Music] and this is one of my favorites a comforting smoky bacon sweet corn and potato soup thrifty for me is about ingredients that are in the cupboard smoky bacon onions potatoes sweet corn it's amazing how cheap the ingredients are they go into this get your bacon and just cut into nice chunks i want these nice bite-sized pieces smoky chunky and just absolutely delicious it's almost like an american corn chowder potatoes give it starch thickness sweet corn gives it that glossy delicious flavor a couple of baileys they're always hanging around if they're not in your cupboard they're on someone's drive so ask to borrow them they are so powerful and it goes brilliantly well with the onions and the bacon bay leaves in a couple of potatoes it's incredible how far you can stretch something out especially when you bulk it with potatoes slice them and dice them nice and chunky soups are a fantastic way to use up leftover veg or meat that might otherwise go to waste and if you make it in bulk freeze it in individual portions and save on lunches throughout the week so you can see already how hearty and robust the soup is it's a delicious combination onions bacon potatoes and now some fresh leeks open up the leak into four give that a nice wash licks often have soil left in their tops so it's important to clean them thoroughly start sweating that down we haven't even got a corn in there yet and already it's looking and smelling incredible add salt but remember you've got bacon in there which is salty so proceed with caution really important to sweat those potatoes off i love getting that flavor from the smoky bacon in with the potatoes now once the leek is sweated off creamed corn a popular side dish in the states creamed corn is made from fresh frozen or even tinned corn cooked with onion butter and cream and can be bought ready made that starts to give the foundation the soup the creamed corn add the sweet corn then your stock don't flood the soup just bring the stock to underneath the ingredients you can always add very difficult to take away homemade chicken stock is so cheap to make just boil up your roast chicken bones with a few fresh veg and freeze in batches for when you need it lighten the load with a touch of milk that gives a really nice bright color now bring that up to the ball turn it down and let it simmer for 12 to 15 minutes as it cooks slowly the starch thickens the soup the bacon renders and that leek onion starts to puree and the corn just shines okay next we're gonna make the american cheese biscuits in the uk they're known as scones but in america they're called biscuits [Music] first put plain flour into a sieve add baking powder and sift both into a bowl next add some salt pepper and grated mature cheddar cheese mix the dry ingredients then make it well in the center pour in double cream and gently combine with a wooden spoon turn your dough out onto a floured surface and knead for a few seconds only if you overwork it your cheese biscuits won't rise roll out your dough to about two centimeter thick and cut into four centimeter round biscuits [Applause] place well apart on a lined baking sheet and leave to rest on the tray for about 10 minutes then brush the top of each biscuit with melted butter and bake for about 30 minutes at 160 degrees c in a preheated oven when your cheese biscuits are well risen and a beautiful golden brown remove deliciously moorish served hot or cold time to dole out my thrifty lunch i always like to leave a soup to stand or rest it looks richer it gets rid of all the stock i like to have two thirds ingredient one-third of the stock so it looks like a nice delicious chunky soup into the bowl [Music] beautiful tin sweet corn a leek potato and some streaky bacon but it doesn't look like it's just come out of a store cupboard that is proper hearty food [Music] served with my american style cheese biscuits this thrifty lunch may have been made on a shoestring but without an ounce of compromise on freshness and flavor noodle soup with poached egg and spring onions [Music] add miso paste to boiling water japanese misu has a wonderful deep savoury richness and is brilliant in soups grating fresh ginger add dry shiitake mushrooms that have been soaked in water season with soy sauce crack an egg add it to the broth and poach for two to three minutes add thinly sliced portobello mushrooms to a serving bowl put in fresh medium egg noodles which will heat through in the hot meso broth add spinach [Music] then simply spoon the broth into your bowl top with the egg and fresh chopped spring onions so simple so good and so delicious ready in 10 minutes super fast noodle soup with poached egg and spring onions my recipe for meatballs is so versatile it can be used to make a dozen amazing dishes one of my favorites is meatballs in fragrant coconut broth having a freezer of home-cooked delicious food ready to go can be a real life saver it means you never have to compromise on flavor these meatballs are delicious but more importantly they freeze so well first off get your pan on and start sweating off your onions and your garlic this recipe involves making the meatballs a classic way but the exciting part is actually cook them in coconut milk and it gives a really nice new dimension to a sort of soft rich sumptuous meatball chop the onion nice and finely keeping those slices very close together closer the slices the finer the onions pat it back down at an angle slice down and just chop i want the onions nice and fine because i want some finesse to these meatballs the secret of a really good meatball is the texture getting that balance right between the minced beef the breadcrumbs the milk and the seasoning a couple cloves of garlic slice the garlic really nice and thinly nice pan nice and hot a tablespoon of olive oil quite generous with the olive oil onions and garlic in we'll touch the salt and pepper with your mince open it up a little bit and sort of pat it out salt and pepper for me a good meatball is all about the the softness the texture of that rich beef and the way it sort of melts in your mouth you can color it on the outside but you want it nice and soft and sort of rich in the center mix that in beautifully and then paste it back out again i've got some really nice dried chili flakes i'm gonna season the onions with the chili flakes chili flakes in cook that out for two minutes i'm gonna add some milk [Music] take your bread crumbs make a little well three four tablespoons of milk that makes a sort of nice slightly doughy texture but it lightens the texture of the meatball place that in add your onions your garlic and your chilli in there as well nice put your hands in there and start mixing them if you've got the right amount of milk and breadcrumbs doesn't mean binding with an egg don't make them too small the problem with making them too small is the fact that they dry out quickly just the size of a golf ball a little bit bigger nice really nice tight squeeze that stops it from breaking up it always pays to double the recipe and spend a bit more time making extra meatballs so you can freeze a batch ready for another time give the pan a little wipe out don't wash out that pan we've got that flavour from the onions and the garlic at the bottom get that pan nice and hot a touch of olive oil in there place them at the top of your pan nice and gently sit them in the oil get a pallet knife and go underneath them and just sort of tilt the pan and let the pan cook the back of the meatball we're going to add some heat coanda seeds slightly spicy and peppery just to give a really nice flavor to the coconut milk in next some cardamom seeds three or four onto the board knife on in a little touch of turmeric into the center of the pan that's going to give it a really nice spicy flavor a little pinch of cinnamon all the time you're doing this those meatballs are just getting tastier and tastier a couple of dried chilies let them infuse in that oil and then some lemongrass just take the back of your knife and sort of beat it down that starts to release all that lovely sort of fragrance like someone's just let off the most amazing fragrant air freshener in the lemongrass and finally some fresh ginger just peel and slice nice and thinly time now to turn them over and let the other half a wonderful flavor chicken stock in bring the stock up to the boil turn the gas up and then add the coconut milk i want the coconut milk just sitting underneath the top of the meatball coconut milk in and that sort of gives it that creamy richness but it's not heavy it's a fragrant light richness before we start simmering check the seasoning that nice soft texture of the meatball but that fragrance light richness of the coconut broth just gonna cook those meatballs perfectly bring the broth up to the boil then simmer gently for eight to ten minutes touch them with your finger this should be slightly pliable but slightly springy gas off i'm going to finish it off with something light and fresh zest of lime but i want the zest on top of the meatball so cut through that richness and then finally squeeze the fresh lime and that just gives it that nice zesty amazing taste stir in the juice mmm i've got that kick and that vibrant taste now the exciting part when you come to serve it be generous with that coconut broth tilt the pan get a good couple of ladles of the broth in meatballs [Music] and that is a very delicious way of eating a old-fashioned meatball and bringing it into the 21st century and they're just as good cooked from frozen as well [Music] you

Whether you want a roasted tomato soup or fancy something with a bit of a kick, like a spicy clam noodle soup - we've got you covered.

#GordonRamsa...",2022-11-29 22:16:02.926159, soups can be light and delicate or rich and gutsy they're versatile practical and easy to make and for my ultimate hearty lunch i'm making one of my childhood favorites roasted tomato soup beautiful vine tomatoes the riper the tomatoes the better the soup take the core out get your thumb and place it half a centimetre underneath the tip of your knife place it in and then just twist around that's the only part of the tomato that we're not using red onion and garlic red onion because it's sweeter than a white onion slice your onions and your garlic nice and fine traditionally be making it in a pot it's so much better to start it off on top of the stove searing the tomatoes and the garlic when it goes in the oven you actually roast the tomatoes and they don't stew there's a big difference in flavor be quite generous with the olive oil it makes the soup nice and glossy shiny salt pepper and then a little teaspoon of cayenne just gives it that heat but it's not as fierce as chili take your tomatoes and just slice them in half and then a little touch of sugar that's gonna help intensify the sweetness a little sprinkle of aged bottled vinegar it gives that nice dark rich acidity to the soup into the oven 20 25 minutes 180. to make my soup even more irresistible i'm going to make a punchy sun-dried tomato pesto to drizzle over the top now i'm making this in a pestle and mortar because you feel so much more in control and you're not depending on a blade that's whizzing around at a thousand miles an hour next in a dry pan toast off some pine nuts toast them the absolute max and then in smell in there is incredible parmesan lightly grate that this is where it starts to become creamy extra virgin olive oil doesn't need salt because the parmesan is going to season it for you and just take a couple tablespoons of the oil that the sun-dried tomatoes are in really helps to make that stunning pesto i can smell those roasted tomatoes want them out wow next pour in a little vegetable stock or chicken stock so it sits halfway up the tomatoes put your spoon through those tomatoes they break up instantly bring that up to the bowl let it simmer for three or four minutes i want to make it a little bit more creamy now cream in give that a little stir you can keep it rustic and you get your masher in and you've got that nice thick rich chunky tomato soup or get yourself a stick blender blitzing it like that you delays the bottom of the pan and you get all those amazing flavors from the bottom that's delicious to make my lunch extra hearty i'm gonna knock up a deliciously gutsy version of cheese on toast to go with my tomato soup whilst we have it an absolute classic i'm gonna make a roux 50 grams of butter three nice tablespoons of flour and that's all the roux is basically traditionally you would use flour butter and milk but in welsh rabbit the milk is often cheekily substituted for a stiff slug of stout gives it that strong gutsy flavor i want it nice and thick make sure those lumps are out a nice teaspoon of dijon mustard and then season it nice and spicy moisture sauce gives it that delicious intriguing flavor now that smells amazing almost brings tears to your eyes beautiful now whilst rabbit wouldn't be a stunning welsh rabbit without rich mature cheese soap and a great montgomery cheddar goes well with the beer and drop that in really important to put this in while the roux is still nice and hot because the cheese melts now for the bread i prefer a good rustic country loaf that will stand up to my hardcore topping i want that nice crisp base to my welsh rabbit so toast it both sides [Music] spread that beautiful cheesy berry spicy mixture just great got a blister and bubble and gratinate god a little splash alien perry and back under the grill for 90 seconds in one delicious creamy roasted tomato soup it's coming back to me all those days i had off school i used to purposely lie about feeling ill just to get a bowl of my mother's tomato soup how bad was that but my god it was worth it oh now my welsh rabbit [Music] look at those babies that just takes cheese on toast to another level wow roasted creamy tomato soup with a sun-dried tomato pesto served with the most amazing delicious welsh rabbit i feel like ringing in sick [Music] all over southeast asia you find people cooking and eating the huge bowls of delicious noodle soups it's a very simple dish but the variations you get are extraordinary different meats different fish and even different dumplings but what i love most about noodle soup is the fact there's a complete meal carbs protein and vegetables in one big bowl of happiness for my ultimate southeast asian lunch i'm showing you one of my favorites spicy clam and noodle soup followed by sweet morish banana and coconut fritters for dessert first up my dessert banana fritters take your bananas and to get them really nice and soft just rub the banana sip together flour and baking powder sugar into the flour then add coconut for texture and a pinch of salt sounds strange in the dessert but it works brilliantly especially with the fritters it makes the batter nice and crisp start crushing and use the back of the fork and just push it against the side of the bowl and then once you've mixed that through i'm gonna make that mix now slightly fragrant with some lime zest now the lime just really elevates the sort of richness and the denseness of the banana cover with tim film so it doesn't get a skin on top sit that in the fridge for 15 minutes as the banana fritter mixture rests i'm getting on with my broth for the noodle and clam soup fish stock is the base bring that up to the boil now to take that broth to another level in with chopped shallots fresh ginger add a whole chili seeds and all i actually quite like it spicy adjust chop once and into the broth bring up the ball and let it simmer galangal it's sort of almost like a softer version of ginger slightly milder you can use galangal paste but i prefer the fresh stuff the stems for the coriander we'll finish the broth with the heads and that's what endeared me to the southeast asian style of cooking across my travels there was there's no waste in lime leaves for me one of my favorites incredibly pungent strong full of flavor very acidic but gives a really nice aroma to the broth just tear them in now the lemongrass so the secret here that's where all the flavor is right at the very end so you take the back of the knife and you just bash the lemongrass it's all that flavor is going to run out in seconds that's the base of the broth done the longer you leave it the more intense it gets whilst the broth infuses soak your rice noodles in boiling water for 10 minutes just enough time to fry your fritters the batter now is ready use a metal spoon to drop the batter to the bottom of the pan they hit that oil they puff up that's why it's important to put your spoon into the oil so the mixture runs off and creates this lovely little fritter and then gently fry get a slotted spoon and nice and carefully turn them the smell of that lime is extraordinary fry for two to three minutes as they start floating it signifies the fact that they're cooked off with a gas and just let them drain are those beauties lovely sprinkling when they're hot with a sugar actually sticks to them they're done ready to go the last job before serving the clams never be scared of cooking shellfish the most important rule is if they are slightly opened a millimeter discard it make sure mussels clams are always tight cook the clams for just three to five minutes or until they're all open bring that up to the boil and this is where we finish the broth touch of fish sauce a little sprinkle of sugar drain your noodles into the bowl for added texture some delicious bean sprouts get your lime fresh squeeze and lime juice in beautiful literally as the stock comes up to the boil the clams open automatically so they cook beautifully the flavor from inside the clam has enhanced the broth smell is incredible the clams cooked finish with fresh coriander and serve there you have perfect lunch a delicious spicy clam noodle with an amazing banana fritter my spicy clam noodle soup and banana and coconut fritters made in minutes and proof you only need to travel as far as your kitchen to get the taste of southeast asia [Music] spicy mexican soup it's hearty delicious robust but served with some tortillas and a wonderful salsa it's almost like a complete meal in one starting with some finely chopped red onions for my soup let's get some heat going early these are chipotle so they're smoky rich they don't come with any warning signal and these are seriously hot so be adventurous but beware a nice teaspoon of toasted cumin oregano dried now start frying off spices the heat you'll see the chilies start swelling up delicious garlic be quite generous on the oil because that helps to blow out the chili right now those onions and garlic are on fire we're gonna balance the sort of heat from the chipotle with sugar turn up the heat and really start caramelizing that sugar and the chili gives off the most amazing aroma next fry up a tablespoon of tomato puree add a can of chopped tomatoes cook kidney beans and vegetable or chicken stock to cover there's something quite exciting about big and bold flavors because in the restaurants you have to be somewhat controlled you can't go crazy so cooking these kind of dishes at home gives me that kind of release chilis particularly when they're dried continue to swell and release their heat as they're cooked so the longer you cook your dish the hotter it will be but it's not as powerful it needs to be yet and every five six seven eight minutes that's gonna get stronger hotter and more delicious bring that up to the ball and cook that out for 15 minutes whilst i allow the chili heat to infuse i'm going to crack on with quick crunchy tortilla chips and a fabulously fresh and spicy tomato salsa known in mexico as pico de gallo start by finely dicing three ripe tomatoes one or two deceeded fresh jalapeno peppers and half a red onion then chop a good handful of fresh coriander add the juice from two limes salt and pepper and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil for the tortilla chips rub a little olive oil onto six large shop bought wheat wraps sprinkle with smoked paprika and gently massage in cut each wrap into triangles and spread them onto a baking tray bake for three to four minutes in a preheated oven 180 degrees until golden brown and leave to cool to complete my mexican lunch i need to finish my deliciously fragrant spicy soup the spice is there it is absolutely spot on now for the cooling down process the mexicans are brilliant at building layer upon layer of flavor with delicious chilies and spices but they're also experts at tempering their dishes with cooling ingredients like avocado sour cream and cheese that's why you can take that amount of chili you'll have a spoon of richness spice and all of a sudden avocados almost like a little fire blanket over those chillies to further counter the chili heat mexicans use a rich tangy crumbly cheese but i'm sprinkling on lancashire which is a great british substitute and last but not least cooling fresh coriander one delicious spicy mexican soup serve that with your tortilla chips and your pico de gallo salsa a phenomenal blend of textures and layers and spice and creaminess big bold and delicious

away you're like nice and brown i'm getting good at this you are skin side down so we got the color on the skin now i just want you to cut the mushrooms in half the belly please okay these are chestnut mushrooms there are lots of different types of mushrooms out there there are lots and lots of different types of mushrooms one of my favorites is the giro mushroom i like mushrooms that are a bit bigger than this and um some dinners with mum we cut out the middle put pesto and cheese in it and then we bake them uh-oh i want you to sprinkle the pancetta over the chicken please good girl nice put the mushrooms in not yet because i'm gonna get some color on the chicken first okay and as that pancetta starts to cook down it puts a really nice flavor on the chicken so we're sort of soating everything okay right garlic in please good girl just throw them in and i want you to sprinkle the mushrooms on top of that good girl and then there's the rosemary you can get your fingers like that and you pull it down you take it all off hold it put it down good girl so now you've got the nice little rosemary sprigs and we do the same with the thyme now the thyme flour is a little bit smaller what different flavors do they give so the thyme is a little bit sweeter okay and the rosemary a little bit more savoury which ones you like i like them both because they both get a nice smell don't they so bay leaf in i'd like you to put that rosemary and thyme in there please lovely sprinkle it over right i'd like you to stand back now because we're going to flambe this i do not want to get those little slippers caught on fire what are the names rampa and judy judah nice okay great ready yeah in with the brandy and then just tilt the pan gently whoa whoa how cool is that magical beautiful bit like a cauldron all the cognac has been flambe so there's no raw alcohol anywhere so we've got a really nice deep rich flavor i'm going to add my chicken stock you know rampo likes that not my slipper rump or run for the dog ah rumple the dog well he likes chicken stock yes when he's a good boy he gets some he gets it in his um with his biscuit it's gone in like wow really quickly simmer and reduce the stock for around 10 minutes now we're gonna cook the most amazing potatoes soda potatoes are really simple to make and absolutely delicious start by slicing the potatoes into finger whipped pieces then parboil them for five to six minutes when you cook something like rosemary or thyme or basil does it slowly let off the flavor into the bottle very much so in a hot pan add a tablespoon of goose fat and saute the potatoes until they turn golden and add in shallots garlic rosemary and thyme that goes in over top and that goose fat now is starting to fry the potatoes you just leave that sat there to complete my ultimate french dinner my version of a classic a glorious lavender creme caramel for dessert the first job is the lavender sugar you can buy this ready-made or simply add dried edible sprigs of lavender to caster sugar and store you can also try this trick with vanilla pods and cinnamon to bring new subtle flavors to sweets and bacon [Music] for the creme caramel melt plain caster sugar until it turns dark golden pour into ramekins sprinkle with lavender flowers and cool now to make a simple custard gently heat whole milk in a pan until steaming meanwhile whisk together egg vanilla seeds and lavender sugar until golden and fluffy then gradually pour the hot milk into the mix whisking continuously until the custard is smooth and creamy to set cook in a water bath or bamberry a good tip is to line a roasting tin with a cloth to stop the ramekins jiggling around pour your custard then boiling water around the ramekins until halfway up the sides then cook in a preheated oven for around 30 minutes until set cool in the fridge then when you're ready to serve dip the ramekins in hot water to loosen the creme caramel [Music] lavender clean caramel [Music] look at that chicken now so i'm just gonna turn the gas right down and put the lid on just like that but leave a little bit so it can let out some stuff so i can let out some steam that's right now what i'd like to do is to chop daddy some parsley crunch it up nicely tuck your fingers in and take your time [Music] now my hands have got lots of different flavors all those wonderful flavors you could almost be french sprinkle that on there good girl nice messy boku i can tell jack's going to love this is he looks the nest doesn't it smells delicious look at that i could smell that even before you took the lid off let's kill my darling good job by the way thank you i can't wait for the others to try it i hope that i love it this is my ultimate french dinner chicken fricassee with sensational herbie sauteed potatoes and lavender creme caramel the main course will be a crispy big caesar salad but the first job are my peanut butter and jam cookies [Music] start with a cookie dough simply combine muscovado sugar peanut butter and butter until light and fluffy then add your egg a splash of milk vanilla seeds and beat again until smooth sift together salt baking powder and flour [Music] then mix until thoroughly combined [Music] in floured hands roll the cookie dough into golf ball sizes flatten and create an indent with your finger fill with half jam and half peanut butter place the cookies on a tray lined with baking paper and bake in a preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes cool before serving [Music] next job main course and my take on an iconic american salad first made almost a century ago caesar salad is definitely a classic but the trick to keeping dishes like this modern and relevant is to tweak them but not lose what made them brilliant in the first place here's my version for the ultimate american lunch my first twist is in the dressing for me the most important part of the caesar salad is that dressing rich creamy slightly spicy begin by making a basic mayonnaise start off with the egg yolks in just a little spoon dijon and then a little splash of red wine vinegar start whisking once you've got that nice slightly thickened texture drizzle in your olive oil it should fall through your whisk it's like a nice thick double cream texture beautiful now take the mayo to another level with anchovies and crushed garlic now chop up the anchovies and the garlic together so we almost want that to be like a really nice puree then grated parmesan lemon juice that will make the dressing citrusy lighter in color and then a little splash of water in now all of a sudden it transforms that mayonnaise into an amazing delicious light dressing nice next job the croutons and i like using crusty bread for extra crunch and just dice up your bread season with salt and pepper then add to a hot pan with olive oil and fry give that a really nice toss as the croutons start to turn golden simply grate on a generous amount of parmesan cheese keep them rolling around stop them from sticking together look at that really nice cheesy delicious crouton and now they're out now for the fun job assembling the caesar salad starting with romaine lettuce and don't slice the lettuce too thinly a squeeze of lemon on with half of that gutsy anchovy mayo dressing saving some to coat your chicken later then sprinkle half your croutons give that a really nice mix salad in it's all beautifully dressed add the remaining croutons and finish with a good grating of parmesan cheese that for me is a perfect caesar salad however i'm gonna take it to another level and grill a stunning chicken breast start by preheating your griddle pan then butterfly your chicken breast simply slice from the thin end towards the thick bit of the breast let the knife do the work and literally just open up now that's how we butterfly a chicken breast so therefore it will cook twice as quick and just nice and moist in the center season the chicken on both sides with salt and ground pepper lay your chicken breast onto the grill [Music] never oil the grill until absolutely ready to cook your chicken now turn them over [Music] beautiful cook for three to four minutes on each side until the chicken's got those lovely stripes from the griddle which adds a gorgeous smoky flavor whilst they rest spoon over some of the remaining anchovy dressing the chicken cools down the flavour the seasoning of the anchovy the garlic and the pound zone seeps into that chicken slice the chicken into strips wow i serve the chicken warm in a separate bowl so it doesn't wilt the salad just bring the dressing finished out with a little touch of dressing an american classic i think one of the most popular salads anywhere in the world but it's still one of the most delicious [Music] when it comes to lunch this really is an american dream a delicious caesar salad and succulent golden griddle chicken with peanut butter and jam cookies for dessert [Music] your favorite chicken thighs first of all we'll turn on the grill the reason why we're using the thighs are you the brown meat is so it doesn't go dry season a nice salt pepper olive oil then turn them over please come on get your hands in there good don't worry about your nail bun so there's no bones in there so the chicken will cook really quickly why do you do it skin side down skin side down first that'll stop the chicken from going dry and it'll get it really nice and crispy good see the way it's marked the skin now yeah got all that really nice flavor in there as well and we'll turn them every two or three minutes how much do you love chicken lots lots i'm gonna serve that some really nice chickpeas first we're gonna make a little dressing okay one nice teaspoon of mustard in

dessert of lemon and basil granita start by putting the juice of seven lemons and the zest of one into a small pan with a sprinkling of caster sugar stir over a medium heat until the sugar dissolves

is frozen around the edges lightly break up the mixture with a fork [Music] return to the freezer and repeat twice until the granita is frozen with a granular texture spoon into chilled serving

out there serving seriously delicious food that you can eat on the go my first recipe is a special mix of fantastic flavors from around the world beef tacos with wasabi mayo the great thing about street food is anything goes the only rule is they've got to be really fast and really tasty now these tacos mix a mexican and japanese flavours into a delicious meaty mouthful first off get that pan really nice and hot these are sirloin steaks sear it in the pan with all that fat on i'll add flavor salt and pepper couple tablespoons of olive oil in pan nice and hot hold up the steak and lay it in always lay away give the pan a little shake and it stops the steak from sticking we're looking for color and if it sticks it's gonna burn [Music] while the steaks are cooking i can get on with my super quick marinade now two tablespoons of misood paste that's a fermented soy bean that gives a really nice sort of rich sweetness tablespoon of sugar a couple of tablespoons rice wine that gives it a really nice vinegary kick couple of tablespoons of olive oil salt and pepper i'm looking for a nice sort of thick rich marinade marinade done it's time to turn the steaks sort the pan and to give the steaks a little base all we're doing every time is just adding more more flavor take your tongs and sort of lift the steak on its back and really melt all that fat down off of the gas take them out just take your knife see all that fat there just slice that off i don't want any of that now in to the marinade [Music] beautiful tacos are one of mexico's most popular street foods they've been made from beef pork chicken or fish and are loaded up with amazing sauces and spices now i want something sort of pickly cabbage these are um chinese cabbages slice it in half and look at it really crisp and really tasty we're gonna slice that into quarters and then just shred it and take your time you think of cabbage here and you think of sort of braised overcooked cabbage nothing worse but at a taco you want freshness a little season chili flakes they sort of discreetly give it a little bit of heat a little touch of rice wine vinegar if you haven't got that fresh lemon juice a small drop of toasted sesame seed oil give that a really good mix now i need something to sort of bring it together we take some wasabi paste very hot very spicy a sort of thumbnail size i'm gonna mix that a couple of tablespoons of mayonnaise and give that a really good mix these are basic corn tortilla the trick is to sort of color them and then shape them actually place it on the gas ring use some tongs so it's not to burn yourself you can also toast your tacos in a frying pan from there i'm just gonna place it on the rolling pin literally 30 seconds as it cools down the great thing about serving tacos is people can fill them themselves just the way they want them cabbage just squeeze out wet marinade a nice rustic little mountain mayonnaise on wait you see how soft and delicious and almost sort of melting in the mouth texture we've got on this amazing sirloin look at that really nice sear around the outside it's just nice and pink in the middle start off with my crispy shell back of the spoon with the wasabi mayonnaise inside taco and just sprinkle that delicious pickled cabbage and then just start lining my taco three or four slices touch more on my spicy layer and that is how i'd make the perfect taco [Music] spicy mexican soup it's hearty delicious robust but served with some tortillas and a wonderful salsa it's almost like a complete meal in one starting with some finely chopped red onions for my soup let's get some heat going early these are chipotle so they're smoky rich they don't come with any warning signal and these are seriously hot so be adventurous but beware a nice teaspoon of toasted cumin oregano dried now start frying off spices the heat you'll see the chilies start swelling up delicious garlic be quite generous on the oil because that helps to blow out the chili right now those onions and garlic are on fire we're gonna balance the sort of heat from the chipotle with sugar turn up the heat and really start caramelizing that sugar and the chili gives off the most amazing aroma next fry up a tablespoon of tomato puree add a can of chopped tomatoes cook kidney beans and vegetable or chicken stock to cover there's something quite exciting about big and bold flavors because in the restaurants you have to be somewhat controlled you can't go crazy so cooking these kind of dishes at home gives me that kind of release chilis particularly when they're dried continue to swell and release their heat as they're cooked so the longer you cook your dish the hot it will be but it's not as powerful it needs to be yet and every five six seven eight minutes that's gonna get stronger hotter and more delicious bring that up to the bowl and cook that out for 15 minutes whilst i allow the chili heat to infuse i'm going to crack on with quick crunchy tortilla chips and a fabulously fresh and spicy tomato salsa known in mexico as pico de gallo start by finely dicing three ripe tomatoes one or two deceeded fresh jalapeno peppers and half a red onion then chop a good handful of fresh coriander add the juice from two limes salt and pepper and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil for the tortilla chips rub a little olive oil onto six large shop bought wheat wraps [Music] sprinkle with smoked paprika and gently massage in cut each wrap into triangles and spread them onto a baking tray bake for three to four minutes in a preheated oven 180 degrees until golden brown and leave to cool to complete my mexican lunch i need to finish my deliciously fragrant spicy soup the spice is there it is absolutely spot on now for the cooling down process the mexicans are brilliant at building layer upon layer of flavor with delicious chilies and spices but they're also experts at tempering their dishes with cooling ingredients like avocado sour cream and cheese that's why you can take that amount of chili you'll have a spoon of richness spice and all of a sudden avocados almost like a little fire blanket over those chilies to further counter the chilli heat mexicans use a rich tangy crumbly cheese but i'm sprinkling on lancashire which is a great british substitute and last but not least cooling fresh coriander one delicious spicy mexican soup serve that with your tortilla chips and your pico de gallo salsa a phenomenal blend of textures and layers and spice and creaminess big bold spicy mexican eggs this is a very classic mexican style brunch dish bold kick-ass flavors slice the chili seeds in garlic sliced nice and thinly a tablespoon of olive oil i'm a big fan of brunches and if you get it right a great brunch can see you right through to dinner now to start the sort of spicy fragrant tomato sauce get your cumin in there garlic chili roasted cumin red onions already sounds mexican once that starts getting really nice and crispy in with your tomatoes never embarrassed using good canned tomatoes i do all the time cooking at home now by reducing that you sort of come down to a delicious paste leave that to simmer next canned beans called black beans these are authentically mexican but cannellini beans or chickpeas will work just fine just rinse them a little bit of water that is beautiful turn off the gas and just let it absorb leaving the dense beans to luxuriate in the spicy tomato sauce will allow them to soften and soak up all the flavor next oil and season an ovenproof dish from my spicy egg brunch to baking now just get some of that oil around the outside take your corn tortillas slice them in half and then just stick them to the side these are a staple in mexico take one and place that in the center get your mix and place that on top of the tortilla spread that out nice and smoothly lift up those little flaps i want that crisp shell on the outside now your eggs and cheese get the base of the egg and just make a little hole in there and then crack the egg into there again use a little point put your egg in there one two three four five and one in the middle gently crack and get the egg to sit inside almost like it's a little dug out and then one for the center get a really nice rich delicious strong montgomery cheddar i wanna grate the tortilla shell as well so get generous with it on the top i'm going to season that with these little babies little chili flakes they're my little secret weapon and they're going to spice up that egg just salt a touch of pepper sit that in the oven to bake for eight to ten minutes and 180. [Music] [Applause] that smells incredible a little bit of coriander to finish it off and that for me is what brunch is all about let's go a fantastic fiery brunch to get your party started spicy mexican eggs and a crispy tortilla shell

diplomacy were you a chef i was a cook exactly that no really you used to help me with these little right you kids do no potatoes these are nice and fluffy aren't they aren't they and you want them little delicious mashed potatoes yeah with no lumps in there hey what are you getting at huh it's great having you back in the kitchen mommy now yeah seriously brings back good memories no just why'd you do that dad i just want to fork it to get it nice and spiky so i want that nice crispy topping and then lightly grate that cheddar cheese on top and that goes in the oven literally 20 minutes 180 minutes jack can you up the door people that looks lovely doesn't it even though you said you didn't like it earlier okay back in the day mama's meals all came with two veg and this is no different but with a modern twist braised peas and carrots with a fantastic homemade mint butter shepherd's pie glazed on top that looks lovely doesn't it doesn't it and then the carrots oh seeded coats that's why i didn't put carrots in let's put them on the side i'll see last job before serving pour that gorgeous butterscotch sauce over the pudding okay i'll take one at a time that smells incredible this is my ultimate childhood dinner shepherd's pie with crispy cheese champ topping sweet buttery peas and carrots and a steam date pudding dripping in butterscotch sauce eating mess bomb right eat a mess what's the one thing you love about easter mess i love the meringues now this is a eaten mess with a twist what's the twist in it compared to the normal one we're going to freeze it so it's almost like a sort of eaten mess bomb wow now i'd like you to whisk the cream please half the strawberries are going to go through the mix and half the strawberries are going to be turned into a coulis strawberries in first a little dusting of icing sugar into the pan and now the icing sugar will withdraw the sweetness from the strawberries and start caramelizing so let me show you a nice quick way of whisking secret whisking is like 10 seconds on and 10 seconds off that way your arms don't get tired now i'm going to take the cream to a three-quarter stage what is a three-quarter mix so we leave some sort of texture in the cream that's what we call three-quarter whip and you've got a nice soft peak they're caramelized there you go you put a little touch of water in there that'll help break down the sugar and turn that into a really nice strawberry liquid now to get it really nice and fine i'm gonna blend it on and blitz off okay that's fine i want you to use the back of the spoon and push that through the sieve okay now that way you don't get those seeds smells so good i love this now nice this is the exciting part hold on oh meg right now the meringue with your fingers just crush and flake the meringue into the cream how big should i crush it dado there nice big chunks okay lovely oh okay yeah come on rang in my eye damn to make this dessert even easier i often cheat by using good quality shot port meringues you know taste that's just cream and bread wow it's a little tasty okay strawberries in next a couple of spoons of the cooling now look at that now to prepare the mold to transform the traditional eaten mess into a frozen bomb form a triple layer of climb film adding water to the bowl will help the climb film stick as i pour that in i want you to spread it down okay at the bottom and push it down can you hear that crunch yeah the line all right now fold the cling film over put that in the freezer please make young please in the freezer she goes [Music] dessert done now for our main course with a twist that is the rib eye we've had that in the fridge not wrapped so it sort of almost air dries and it intensifies the flavor gross so much quicker and there's less water in the beef for me the only downside to perfect roast dinner is the fight about who washes up afterwards so meg and i are going to avoid that by cooking everything in one roasting tin starting with the spinach and mushroom stuffing [Music] let's do it with a salt and pepper please good girl some of your left shoulder left shoulder thank you in with the garlic and the mushrooms to toss the pan you push down and pull back down and push back off you go take your time push it down and flip very good that's it push down nice that was lovely and again nice i'm gonna drop let's see well done well done well then right we're gonna sort of make a little well a little touch of butter in the middle now i need to start putting the spinach in the middle piece so you can push that down spinach is cold so you're not going to burn yourself be confident in the pan toss it and you'll see it wilting and disintegrating away wow who would have thought all that spinach could fit in this pan because it's a very delicate leaf it sort of cooks so quickly put this all on your board now and then i just want you to go and give that a nice chop then when you're confident with one hand we need to pick up the other knife the other hand chop it nicely good now outside and come in gently good regroup and take your time yes mmm right i love that smell what is that lemon thyme lemon tan that's right so you get your little thyme stalks and you pour down you sort of strip lemon thyme in now tarragon it'll taste brilliant with the beef fantastic with chicken and fish roughly chop the target and i sprinkling fresh breadcrumbs so the breadcrumbs almost sort of bring the stuffing together next we're gonna get an egg yolk now with the beef this is the exciting part slice with the bone and then come inside and go two thirds of the way down hold that open for daddy salt and pepper and then look we pack our stuffing in there this is amazing it's incredible now just gently hold out there like that okay yeah i'll see you tomorrow what tying string around the rib will keep it all together during roasting not too tight if we tie it too tightly what happens the stuffing will come out that's right that's ready for roasting but we're going to protect it and sit it on a trivet so a trivet basically is almost like a sort of little little bed a little bed that's right if you want to enjoy these delicious roast vegetables at their best make sure you remove them from the hot oven after 35 minutes and reheat before serving with your beef now a little mix for the top a couple of teaspoons of mustard powder in salt a couple of tablespoons of olive oil mix that in i'm gonna pour my mustard powder over the beef so this forms a really nice glaze my one pot roast dinner goes into a hot oven 15 minutes at 230 degrees then down to 170 degrees for another two hours for a delicious twist on traditional yorkshire puds i'm going to lace mine with fresh horseradish with plain white flour in a bowl and crack in the eggs adding only half of your milk at this stage makes it much easier to whisk all the lumps out and if like me you like your puddings a little lighter and crispier add a dribble of cold water and add salt to season when you're happy your batter is lump free whisk in the remaining milk peel and grate horseradish and add a handful to the mix we can leave the batter to rest while we get the meat from the oven that is beautiful and this is where you really need to let it rest how long would you say to rest it for um i like to rest the meat for at least 20 minutes just the right amount of time for us to whack up the oven and to get our yorkshire puddings in i love using the rich dripping but vegetable all is a healthier option to get the fluffiest yorkshires your tray and fat must be piping hot for best results take your jug of batter to the oven and pour the mixture in there it takes just 15 minutes for our yorkshire puds to puff themselves up and turn a delicious golden brown with the yorkshire puddings on the way and the beef rested we can finish off the eater mess bomb run the bowl under the hot water twist and pull nice wow look at that beauty it's amazing sit that on to your plate now the finishing touches a drizzle of the remaining strawberry coulis i'm just gonna pour this over an amazing flavor and some grated mint chocolate and that is a nice twist on a classic eaten mess a delicious eaten mess bomb beautiful let's go baby please don't drop that meg please it's not a rounders match dessert sorted and the beef is ready to serve up lift that up place that onto the board parsnips parrots you can see why we kept them in half they've got all that flavor one beautiful big slice for daddy one for maggie and then on the side it's stuffing the stuffing a bit that's the best to die for now fantastic yorkshire they're amazing aren't they beautiful mm-hmm that's been my darling and that one that's for me beautiful roast beef with a twist wow [Music] these are my ultimate classics with a twist juicy river beef with horseradish spiked yorkshire puds and scrummy eaten mess bomb topped with strawberry coulee and mint chocolate what are your favorites a marshmallow and peanut fridge cake perfect for a picnic first things first you have to slowly melt the chocolate that's bad that's good i'm gonna break up the chocolate right in there next butter goes in couple tablespoons of golden syrup it's so good if we melt chocolate too quickly it starts to separate and destroy the best and safest way to melt chocolate is always use a bain-marie but i'm going to keep a really close eye on mine and heat it over a super low heat this stunning little cake has your favorites in there our digestives now put your hands in there and give them like that one at a time ago and crush what's the one thing that you love about a picnic i love eating outside especially on a nice summery day not so much in the winter no that's gonna be the crunchy part of our fridge cake and it's called a fridge cake because it can sit in the fridge or you can freeze it now the peanuts in please can you use it without peanuts if you're allergic to peanuts oh you can do yeah definitely no what are these little babies cranberries cranberries from there marshmallows my favorite okay they're so bright aren't they why do you love marshmallows so much because they're so squishy all right give that a nice mix up chocolate is melting nicely okay i want you to pour that in and i'll mix it nice and gently slowly slowly slowly soon nice now touch more please good isn't it good give that a little mix with daddy please they're all melty and nice and cool and gooey now we're gonna line the tray so this is quite easy to make because um you don't have to bake it you just set it yeah i want you to start pushing it into the corners please with your fingers just laying out nice and flat ah it's all nice and marshmallow and oozy to get pulled spatula okay and look how delicious does that look really delicious i can eat it right now i couldn't because it's not set all right so when that sets okay it'll go nice and firm and then we can cut it into little bars little squares triangles triangles push push good but the important part of pushing it down is that we can slice it and the more we push the thinner we can slice okay good girl [Music] fridge cake done now i'm gonna make the most amazing anchovy dip with vegetables and bread first cut slices of baguette and bake in the oven at 180 degrees c for six minutes or until crisp meanwhile roughly chop garlic and shallots and add to a food processor along with a tin of good quality anchovies [Music] sprinkle in some pitted black olives flat leaf parsley and drizzle in the reserved anchovy oil and a little olive oil blitz to a paste and add pepper then decant into a jar ready to transport serve with a handful of fresh baby carrots peppery radishes and your crisp baguette toast anchovy dip a portable and deliciously palatable alfresco treat [Music] now a spicy chili yogurt dressing with a prawn salad first things first i'd like you to make the dressing fish sauce doesn't really smell like fishes so one and a half tablespoons of fish sauce two chilli i like this especially if you have it on the side of the pork little teaspoon of sugar oh that's it good in so four tablespoons of yogurt three four some zest in there why are you making it in a jam jar not a bowl well this is for a little picnic and it's a great way of transporting we squeeze the lime in there and then we put the lid on shake it and then i want you to shut it on tight [Music] it's a bit like a tummy see that sounds like my tummy only sometimes only sometimes thank you for that kind of gives you and the first time you have it's like a little thingy it's fresh salty citrusy but delicious now cucumber and the salad i want to get rid of all the seeds so if you just nice and gently peel the cucumber why do you feel it can you not eat the skin on it you can eat the skin but i want this salad to taste light and fresh you can use a knife for this too though can't you you can peel with a knife but a speed peeler takes off the slices nice and thinly so much quicker so much quicker that's why it's called a speed peeler looks better now looks a bit naked it does look a bit naked doesn't it now you get your spoon and see what happens a teaspoon just takes out all those seeds so whilst it sits in the dish it doesn't make the salad go all soft because that cucumber is nice and crunchy [Music] that's really good there you go so see where your knuckles are there that's what's always going to protect if you put that little finger out this little piggy boom comes off what did i tell you about daddy's knuckle that's the first place you cut off all the time there you go the next addition to our prawn salad is firm juicy baby gem lettuce look at the lettuce in half what about the butt the butts [Music] i'm keeping the butts on for now so when i slice it it stays together okay and then a little bit there we don't use okay when you prepare lettuce for picnic you never slice it too thinly okay otherwise it will it's good prawns already your tummy sauce is ready your dressing is ready take the lid off and the trick is you dress the bottom of your dish because i'm gonna put the prawns on here to protect the lettuce get your cucumber i put my cucumber on and then finally that is okay now the salad is not going to go soft why is that because it's not that it's not straight onto the dressing that's right what happens is we wrap this now and then we get to our picnic drizzle the sauce on top we mix it up we've got the dressing on the bottom and the dressing on top of the dressing on top that's right a little bit of tim film do you know the cling film trick i don't know the tinfield trick yet no thing fell over the top of the toilet what you don't understand it when you're my age oh you've been my age then well okay salad in the fridge with the dressing ready to go for a picnic this is my ultimate picnic dinner feast prawn and cucumber salad with a spicy yogurt dressing anchovy dip with crudites and the kids favorite chocolate marshmallow and peanut fridge cake

love hot pot you love hot pot and you love sausages right yeah what do you enjoy most about sausages um i just love having them with the baked beans sometimes with baked beans sometimes these are little button mushrooms okay you just take them into there like that and keep them whole and cut them into quarters please now the important thing about cooking sausages is they need a bit of color right no color no flavor exactly get the pan nice and hot how was school today school was good thanks we got to go out and make snowmen sausages in okay butter mushrooms in there please [Music] see now i want you to wash your fingers but you know how to slice onions right definitely i'll be good right now sausages are getting lots of color because this is going to cook slowly and it's sort of daddy's version of the kind of hot pot the other one nani's to make for me yeah once you've got the color on them and take them out to rest okay a little normal butter okay into the pan now it looks like a lot of onions right yeah as they start sweating down they caramelize so that will go down by half give that a little fry okay salt in i want you to put a nice tablespoon of brown sugar in there that gets them really nice and dark now get your thyme in pick off all the little buds that will get the onions packed with flavor that's kind of nice nice mushrooms in give them a nice little stir did you like to help them make your hot pot when she made them for you i used to always help them make the hot pot always now my mum would never have used this but a's balsamic vinegar brings out the flavor of the onions right now look at her onions look beautifully caramelized the vinegar has given that nice sort of gloss i'm going to put my sausages back in here now from there some red wine red wine end got the flavor underneath there going into the sausages now the sausage is going to release all that flavor inside as well look at the color of that does that look pretty cool and it's still not cooked yet up to the ball really important to boil it here because it won't boil in the oven 170 in the oven literally 18 to 20 minutes then she goes nice to go with my hot pot rich golden creamy potato gratin it's a true comfort food classic and i'm adding a delicious twist beetroot start by gently heating double cream [Music] then peel and thinly slice potatoes and cook beetroot next rub garlic around the edge of your dish to thoroughly season with a glorious flavor then grease with a good layer of butter arrange alternate layers of potato and beetroot seasoning in between end with a neat layer of potatoes and pour the hot cream over the top bake in a preheated oven for an hour or until the potatoes are tender [Music] potato and beetroot greton are bubbling beauty of a comfort food dish now for the apple compote what we need to do first is to get these peeled and sliced i get my pan on to get nice and hot now let me give you a little taste of that is this thanks for the warning you're both so well only blew my head off they're incredibly acidic okay and you need to cook them those wonderful red apples you've got are called brae burns what other apples do you know green ones what they called um i'm not too sure what the green one is another word for your nan grandmas no red no pink lady apple no granny smith granny smith apples that's right what we're gonna do is cook the cooking apples and the eating apples together i love the combination of the tartness from the brambley cooking apple with the sweetness of the braeburn get the pan nice and hot and sprinkle the bottom of the pan with caster sugar three or four nice slices of fresh ginger and three little cinnamon sticks i want you to remember that because we're gonna look for them okay because once we've used them and they've worked their magic i need to pull them out see all the sugar dissolving definitely now we just let that go a little bit darker okay and then the place doesn't it give that a nice little toss okay nice golden color cinnamon in ginger in so we're cooking down the apples butter in gently cook until the apples soften then take off the heat and we go into there what's that coming out dab so that is a little bit of the puree i'll show we'll do that in a minute how many ginger four four ginger and three cinnamon three cinnamon out with the cinnamon we've got other ginger gingers i'm gonna take a spoon of apples it smells so nice how nice is that look see the colory apples let's put these in the fridge to get nice and cold that's the compost sorted easy now a simple creamy whip to crown the top do you separate the egg whites into there for daddy all right egg whites are in they're great separate off [Music] and i'll sprinkle the sugar in and then you turn up the speed [Applause] good girl [Music] please now let's see if you've got a really nice stiff peak so you lift them up now that is what i call a nice stiff peak well done not bad not bad next in a separate bowl whip double cream until stiff nice and slowly so cream whips so much quicker yeah nice we're gonna put some delicious lemon zest which will make the cream so much better then sweeten it up with leftover caramely compot puree you mix that in nice and carefully so it's like this apple butterscotch now to make the cream even lighter fold in those whisked egg whites and sugar egg whites into the cream just nicely fold that in so you bring your glasses back out manage the glasses yep good girl silly we're on for a treat open up the piping bag now twist the end now you could spoon this in but i want to just give a nice little lift it also gives it a nice pattern lemon on top back in the fridge the beetroot and potato gratin is that lovely that's lovely sausages finished with the flat leaf parsley wow look at those two beauties it doesn't get any more comforting than that does it for one of the best hot pots ever tilly that looks amazing i know well done this is my ultimate comfort food dinner sausage hot pot with potato and beetroot gratin followed by apple compote food with guaranteed feel-good factor the perfect side dish for my fantastic fried chicken jack hi my gonna help with some pickling please oh definitely no you love pickles right love pickles um favorite pickle what is it i like pickled onions we're gonna do pickled celery mm-hmm it's a nice little snack and great for planned ones great for salads first thing i'm going to pick the celery for me so you see where the next one's going to be it's in there yeah okay i'll figure it out but i'm hungry today is this all we're having for dinner jack come on i wouldn't do that too you know that there's more coming now because we're pickling it we want to sort of make it look a little bit more attractive so we go around with that okay on an angle so when you pick all the food does it does it preserve it it's exactly what it does but also gives it a really nice salty soury flavor yeah okay now splash of water and then with the sugar nice okay so we've got to bring that up to the bowl and sort of create almost like a little syrup yeah okay little teaspoon of peppercorns in mustard seeds in quite generous on the mustard seeds that gives a bit of sort of spice now those you must know cloves excellent cloves in now touch of salt no okay so from there white wine vinegar now in order for all that to actually pickle you need to boil it so by boiling it okay it brings all the ingredients together infuses all the spices and helps cook the celery have a little taste nice nice see i put some hairs on your chest yes it was good look boom it's working already now see nice wine vinegar right celery's ready yeah okay let's walk to the ball now turn that off now from there start placing the celery into that jar so when you pick other foods can you use that same recipe exactly that 100 once it's pickled it doesn't really go off mm-hmm okay now put them in there so can we eat this straight away when it's in here do you know what as soon as it's cooled down you can definitely eat that straight away i can't wait to dig into it at dinner are they delicious yes we'll leave that to cool down our pickles are ready and cooling now to marinate the chicken on fried chicken traditionally it's always gonna be done with the dark meat the brown meat so you got that nice sort of uh drum here and this bit that thigh cooking on the bone as well keeps it even more moist so first things first salt pepper please from there famous buttermilk buttermilk in it's brilliant for marinating the chicken if you can put this buttermilk over your chicken the night before the more it tenderizes the chicken and starts to sort of really relax the chicken and puts a really nice sort of creamy soury flavor in there so might stick that in the fridge for us please and we'll start the dolce de leche biscuits nice the argentinians call these shortbreads alfa jorge and they're the favorite sweet treat on the streets of buenos aires they're light crumbly shortbread biscuits sandwich with gloriously golden caramelly dolce de leche sauce for the shortbread beat together softened butter granulated sugar and beat until light and fluffy add one egg [Music] slice vanilla pots scrape out the seeds add to the mix and beat again [Music] sift plain flour corn flour and baking powder then fold the mixture together using floured hands roll into small balls flatten into discs and place on a baking tray [Music] chill for 10 minutes until firm to touch then simply bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until pale golden once cooled sandwich two biscuits together with a caramelly dolce de leche sauce [Music] finish with a dusting of icing sugar [Music] delicious my dessert and pickles are ready the buttermilk should have worked its magic on the chicken all that's left is to fry it now we're gonna roll the chicken out of the buttermilk into the flour so that's why it gets nice and crispy and blistery on the outside okay cool so what we've got to make sure because the flour is the last coat yeah this is nicely seasoned yeah okay so salt and pepper in there nice and this is smoked paprika so that gives it a little bit of sort of uh making it yeah yeah spice that's right a little bit of heat and this one my favorites what's that cayenne pepper that's right again slightly spicy but the heat works brilliantly well garlic powder traditionally are used a lot in the steaks onion powder garlic powder just run your fingers through that please cool i'm gonna get the pan on now two centimetres of oil this is a really good mix for fish as well mm-hmm gushon's fighting a nice spicy texture helps fish so first thing is we just shake off some of the buttermilk lay that down yes okay really important to get them covered completely okay in the flour yeah okay so i love fried chicken do you now lift that up there first one and you place it in there away from you off you go nice and gently good and lay away good if any stage you think the oil is getting too hot yeah just add a touch of cold oil in there or turn off the gas good gently fry the chicken for 25 to 30 minutes or until

butt that's away butts away now this is incredible there's the shoulder yeah and look there's the shoulder blade if you go through here there's a knuckle there that's connecting the top and that's why it's called a butt the slower you cook it the more juicy it is and it's great for big parties because you just come along and get your fork and shred it a delicious smoky mayonnaise and you're away onions into half and half again okay i'm gonna leave the roots on okay because i want this to sit underneath the port it gives it a chance to cook evenly and doesn't get dry in the bottom really

oil on top of that for me i keep the pork nice and moist lovely like some of the best party dishes the marinading the pork shoulder can be done days in advance so if i was doing this for a sunday and start marinating thursday friday so it gets even tastier right quite easy as well to make it's very easy five and a half to six hours in the oven at 140. while our pork butt slowly roasts meg and i are gonna pimp some shot-bought mayonnaise i don't like just plain mayonnaise there's so many things you can twist about yeah there's so many things so many exciting things you can do with it right

gherkins or cornichons trim and finely chop spring onions and grate some nutty grilled cheese when the potatoes are cooked through drain roughly crush and add your spring onions and gherkins [Music]

golden rules for producing fantastic food is learning to cook with confidence this recipe is so straightforward but tastes absolutely amazing pan on get that nice and hot you think of the sort of density of a pork chop how it needs a little bit of help sweet sound peppers go brilliantly well first slice the peppers that's the flat side of the pepper so stand it up trying to slice a pepper on the side is a nightmare there's the center start off it's almost like sort of peeling an orange go all the way around and down and look that's what you want now place the pepper down three finger rule one finger in front two behind pinky holding it down thumb holding nice and flat the flatter the vegetables the more confident you are when you slice so don't worry about the speed just let the knife do the work and take your time speed comes the most important thing is to get your technique right red onion now sweet sour peppers olive oil in [Music] i'm going to saute them which is just the chef's turn for shallow frying on a high heat for maximum taste some salt and pepper add a tablespoon of sugar sugar helps to break down the peppers quicker but caramelize the onions frying them in a frying pan perfect it's one of the sort of basic essential tools of any kitchen because it's so multi-purpose great for sauteing tossing great for cooking fresh and meat push away and pull back push away and pull back that hissing is something you need to hear constantly because the minute that's gone your peppers and your onions start to boil and you really want them to soak in you now start to see it glistening the way that it's starting to caramelize sugar's working beautifully that's ready for the red wine vinegar in smells incredible it helps to stain the peppers as well look at the glaze now you can see the sugar it's worked as magic turn down the gas and add a couple of tablespoons of fresh extra virgin olive oil let them stew for two to three minutes now i want to make the peppers nice and light and sort of sweet aromatic just roll the basil almost like a big cigar slice basil in and then literally cook it out for 30 seconds i want them off beautiful okay pan back on now for the pork chops i want to make sure they don't curl up in the pan they start curling up in the pan they're going to cook unevenly a few simple cuts through the rind means the chop stays flat and cooks evenly point the knife down flip through this seasoned beautifully nice large shards of pepper punch that through lightly guaranteed that seasoning is gonna stay there hot pan touch garlic and touch of thyme the garlic take a couple of cloves don't peel it don't chop it just knife on crush it olive oil in just starting to smoke top of the chop in and lay away from me nice keep that heat in the pan put the garlic in there early a nice fragrant bunch of thyme see how the pork is staying nice and flat turn that over look at that beautiful i want a little bit of thyme underneath there start squeezing that garlic out i want the flavor coming out butter in thin slices of butter tilt the pan and baste so i'm sort of speeding up the cooking process at the same time i'm keeping the pork chop really nice and moist and now look at the color of that butter it's almost like sort of a nut brown check the color on the other side useful when they're that thick three and a half to four minutes each side thirty seconds from now they're gonna be medium so i'm gonna take them out and let them rest the secret to perfectly moist pork chops is letting them rest almost as long as they're cooked in the pan [Music] a nice spoon of these peppers the basil smells incredible keep that garlic on there be generous with that vinaigrette from the peppers because it really is incredible do two things simple like that pork and peppers and your confidence is gonna shoot through the roof a stunning pork chop with sweet and sour peppers my next recipe turns what used to be a decidedly unfashionable cut of meat into the star of the dish fit to grace any table slow roasted pork belly with fennel [Music] slow roasting works better on fattier tougher and unfashionable cuts whether it's a cheek or even a neck or this amazing pork belly it's a fantastic way to transform cheap cuts into amazing melting perfection take a very sharp knife bring the pork belly towards you so you're over it and you've got all that pressure and weight using the tip of the knife i'm just sort of nicking it and go across the pork belly long strokes with a knife take your time turn it 180. this time what we're doing is just sort of cutting those nice little sort of diamonds but as that starts roasting on top it starts getting nice and crispy take little handfuls of salt and just sort of rub it in bend it over and in all those cracks really helps to get a nice crisp crackling on top roasting tray getting really nice and hot take a hole over fennel to intensify flavor and to keep the meat succulent i'm braising my pork belly with strong vibrant spices and vegetables crush and peel three whole cloves of garlic and add to the fennel olive oil in fennel in i like the nice strong anita flavour that goes with that nice rich dense pork fennel seeds delicious star anise in and just a couple of cardamom seeds and wow they're like little bangers like little firecrackers incredible lovely fresh bay leaves get your pork skin side down just sear the top of that fat that locks in all that amazing flavor then i'm gonna flip it over and get it nice and crispy and then one fennel seeds embedded in those little cracks now some white wine the minute that white wine hits that pan you can smell that light fragrance from the fennel allow the wine to bubble away and reduce until the alcohol has burnt off time that the stock now the stock goes in just underneath the skin so it roasts on top all that meat under there will be submerged because what happens in the oven the top goes crispy as anything and the stock reduces and brazes at the same time really importantly bring that back up to the ball before it goes in the oven otherwise it will never boil never get up to temperature smells incredible slow roast the pork belly at 180 degrees for two and a half hours [Music] look at that you've got that nice crispy skin on top you can see how much of the stock has evaporated put that onto the board it looks stunning to make a delicious rustic sauce with the flavour-packed contents of the roasting tray first get rid of the excess fat take a couple of slices of bread it's like a perfect sponge because you just lay that on top and drag it almost like a net and it just absorbs all that fat if you want the perfect fried bread trust me stick that in a frying pan a nice teaspoon of mustard whisk that in and then simply simmer for a few minutes before pouring into a serving jug with your pork belly always use a nice serrated edge knife you can hear that oh that is amazing incredibly tender that belly of pork is gonna almost melt in your mouth you've got that sweet meat under that crispy belly of pork what an amazing way to cook a very cheap cut of meat [Music] smoky pork sliders with barbecue sauce everyone loves a burger they're a true fast food original and that's the exciting thing about street food you can take an old classic like that and reinvent it into something really exciting when you think of a burger what you need is a great sauce and unlike smoky barbecue goes hand in glove with a great burger start by finely chopping one onion and three cloves of garlic nice hot pan tablespoon of olive oil onions and garlic into the pan a nice seasoning salt and pepper now the secret of a good barbecue sauce is that really important caramelization to begin with a nice tablespoon of brown sugar it darkens the onions but it really starts to sort of give that nice syrupy body to the sauce and put a little bit of heat in there now a nice teaspoon of smoked paprika that's the important part of working with spices you've got to cook them out and almost sort of burn off that rawness especially with a smoked paprika that's exactly where i want it to go onions and garlic beautifully caramelized cider vinegar in reduce that down now i've got a fantastic smoky base to complete the sauce i'm making my life really easy and adding pre-made worcester sauce and tomato ketchup cook that out for two to three minutes now depending on how thick you like the barbecue sauce that determines how long you cook it out for i don't want it to be too runny but i don't want it too thick either that's the consistency we're looking for lovely turn down the gas charger seasoning now take that out it's the kind of sauce that i like to have sort of bottled up in the fridge it's great for sandwiches but goes brilliantly well with these sliders homemade smoky barbecue sauce [Music] give the pan a little wipe now start the mix for the sliders to give my mix a really interesting flavor and texture i'm gonna be using unsmoked back bacon i travel all over the world and i spend a lot of time in the states they know how to make a great slider pork sliders beef sliders chicken sliders and it's almost like a way of having a burger but on a much smaller miniature level little teaspoon of olive oil i want that bacon to get really nice and crispy bacon in this just gives the really nice sort of chunky delicious mix i want texture and pork is perfect for a slider [Music] and choppy slot slots are a lot sweeter than your normal white onion fine fine fine and in [Music] now that bacon's getting really nice and crispy i want a bit of heat in there a little teaspoon of smoked paprika in there when you see these sliders in the states for one portion there's like four or five of them little mini one biters incredible now take your pork just open up and give that a really nice seasoning so important you can't season a slider after you've cooked it it's impossible so season it nicely bake now that's nice and crispy just take a little touch kitchen roll and just drain that off there nice pat that nice and dry i want all that nice sort of crispiness in there beautiful mix all that in take a nice ball and sort of roll it the size of a golf ball get it nice and round first and then three fingers just pat that down don't flatten them too thin otherwise they overcook and they go sort of dry because sliders are bite-sized burgers designed to go in small buns you don't want to make them too big good get the pan nice and hot a tablespoon of olive oil when a slider is literally that thick about an inch thick we're going to take two and a half to three minutes to each side in turn them over lovely once you've turned them tilt the pan and just spoon all that juice back into them keep my mouth watering now it's very easy to dry the pork out so just feeling it now with your fingers is nice and firm it's a little touch of springiness in the center i'm happy with those add your cheese now so it gets nicely melted i'm using wedgies of smoked cheddar and it has that nice sort of soury smoky creaminess to the slider finally shredded baby gem lettuce just take those buns make sure they're sliced nice and evenly take your lettuce be quite generous with the lettuce just a nice thin slice of tomato take your burgers you see that cheese you feel melted your bbq sauce place the top on and that is my version of a slider that is small dynamic but packed full of flavor i'll take that over a hamburger any day sticky pork ribs one of the secrets to great cooking is patience leaving dishes to marinade for one or two days helps to develop the flavor in your food and the end result so much more delicious it's a method i use in the restaurants all the time first off get your roasting tray put the tray on the gas pork ribs 60 meat and 35 40 fat give them a really good season salt and pepper nice thing about this cut they stay incredibly moist when they're on the bone and the longer you cook them the more delicious they become and just push all that seasoning in to the pork olive oil in make sure that tray is nice and hot and i really want that nice sort of caramelization taking place on the pork that's the nice thing about starting it on top of the stove use your roasting tray get them colored and then the oven putting the ribs straight in the oven you don't get the color it looks sort of boiled as opposed to a nice caramelized rib ginger you can't beat fresh ginger with sticky pork ribs place it down nice and firmly and slice the thinner you slice the ginger the more fragrant the ribs garlic now it's really important before you add anything to those ribs make sure you've got the color from the ribs first don't rush it turn them over that's what i want that nice crispy color as they sort of braise in the oven all that color just turns into the most amazing flavor braising is just a chef's term for cooking something slowly in liquid right ginger and garlic in spread it around on all those ribs to sort of roast the ginger and the garlic chili flakes chili flakes in next szechuan pepper citrusy vibrant peppercorns incredible in next star anise that gives it a really nice sort of anisd flavor almost like you're roasting the ribs in fennel and now we've got the heat got the spice i want to sweeten things up a little bit some fresh honey honey glazes the pork beautifully counteracts against all that spice in there but look what's happening a color on the ribs is extraordinary it's like a really nice chili sweet caramel now soy sauce brings that little bit of saltiness to it really generous with the soy sauce japanese vinegar two tablespoons of vinegar in rice wine it gives it that nice sort of um tartness the ribs if you can't find rice wine our dry sherry's a great substitute 300 ml that takes out the heat of that szechuan pepper those dry chili flakes make sure they're all laid down like a nice tight box of matches bring that up to the boil cooking is all about learning to develop your own likes and dislikes so always keep tasting to make sure you're happy with a combination of flavors it's lacking a little touch of vinegar what that sharpness now think what's going on the tartness the heat the caramel the color on the ribs is amazing i want a bit of a sort of oniony flavor put some springiness in whilst these ribs are in the oven the spring onions will sort of puree they give a sharpness the final taste of that pork in with my spring onions and with my stock 400 ml of stock this is just a simple chicken stock the stock just sits underneath the ribs it absorbs into the rib and the top of the rib glazes underneath the rib that gets crispy and rich and that's what makes the ribs nice and moist really important into the oven cook at 180 for 30 minutes turn the ribs over and cook for a further 30 minutes [Music] now wow they smell incredible each side has got that really nice crispy roasted egg becomes sticky and chewy and sweet sour the fats disappeared and the pork just melts in your mouth i want to take them to the next level gas back on now shake the tray and this is the sort of the way that we finish them in the restaurant but every minute they glaze in that tray they just get to taste better and better now look at them i'm so happy with those ribs done absolutely delicious now but if you want you can put them in the fridge and the flavor will keep developing then just reheat them when you want to so [Music] each rib has a nice slice of ginger on there [Music] wow look at that delicious sticky ribs with an amazing marinade

them hard in the kitchen gives you food in a budget that tastes a million bucks and i'm going to show you how first up my flavor packed lamb with fried bread whether i'm cooking high-end dishes or rustic dishes trust me it all has to be impressive so this lamb dish proves that you don't have to spend a fortune to create delicious food first off put the pan on this is a lamb steak and it's cut just above the leg just here because you can see that delicious bone running through the center and that's full of marrow so that just gives the lamb a nice added sweet flavor just take your knife cut through each end this stops the lamb steak from buckling so therefore it cooks evenly and colors beautifully so and pepper lamb needs quite a lot of help with the pepper so be quite generous with the pepper and just pat that down the pan is just under smoke on the outside now put the oil in get that pan really nice and hot because this is a cheap cut so i'm depending on the color of the lamb steak to really sort of impart a lot of flavor that's the noise you want to hear you can't hear that noise don't drop the steak in put a little bit of garlic in there not chopped garlic just whole cloves the garlic lightly crushed don't even waste time peeling them in tongs lift up that bit of fat around the back that's the top of the leg tilt the pan and let all that fat render rendering is a chef's term that means melting the fat it works brilliantly when you're cooking a rib eye as well cut it over that color beautiful now it looks like an expensive cut and we've got that nice even sear all over as it's cooking just tilt the pan and vase and basting the lamb steak just means you're sort of adding all that nice scented garlic olive oil back into the lamb useful now take the lamb out let the lamb rest [Music] neutral [Music] now for the perfect rustic crouton so this bread's quite firm a couple of days old just slice it straight down the center dice it up put it into a bowl season it beautifully [Music] from there i'm gonna add some milk sounds strange adding milk to crouton but it just gives it that nice rich creamy texture and just let that milk sort of absorb into the bread while that's soaking i'm gonna make the dressing go back to that initial garlic that was in the pan look at that beautiful into the pest and water anchovies anchovies go brilliantly well with lamb i want that nice salty vinegary flavor and a bit of kick some capers the little baby cats very sweet now just pound that to a nice paste that smells incredible next some dijon mustard a nice teaspoon and a half in a little bit of red wine vinegar two tablespoons and then our extra virgin olive oil now it's got that heat in there i've got a nice roasted garlic a real hearty chunky vinaigrette that sort of seeps into that lamb some fresh parsley crunch up the parsley delicious flavour parsley in nice now get your pan hot for the croutons olive oil in the pan grab the croutons and squeeze all the excess milk out not too hard i don't want them dry and in and then just fry them and the milk inside these croutons give it a nice spongy creamy delicious flavor that's the color i want nice now take them out and lightly drain them a little bit kitchen roll onto the board out [Music] it's a plateman just take this amazing vinaigrette and spread it get those croutons listen to them like little boulders hitting the play the lamb sit that on next one on the rest of the croutons on now use all those little bits and my chef in paris would kill me right now if you saw me using those because they're the ugly scraps that customers should never see but but they're the best bits croutons on and then just drop that sauce on all those little bits of the lamb and there that is a perfect way of taking a cheap cut into the premier league of dishes vegetables are such an asset in the kitchen healthy fantastically fresh and incredibly versatile and pound for pound they're so much cheaper than fish or meat just make sure you give them plenty of attitude my homemade gnocchi making your enoki is so simple to do yet the results are absolutely stunning and it's a great way of using up leftover baked potatoes you can make gnocchi just with flour and eggs however the potato gives it a nice light sort of creamy fluffy texture cut them in half take your spoon and scoop the inside of those potatoes i'm using leftover baked potatoes but this really works as well with leftover ball potatoes two choices you can get a fork and sort of mash the potato and get it nice and light and fluffy or this little gadget it's called a ricer i suppose it's a posh word for a potato masher just squeeze gently you can see how nice and light it is almost like fluffy little strands of potato you can do this when the potatoes are hot it'll go through the rice so much quicker just slice that off there now a nice spoon of okata ring a little touch of salt and pepper it's really important to season the mixture as we go along otherwise the nokia becomes really bland flour over the ricotta sieved so there's no lumps one delicious egg give that a little whisk now make a little well in the center you want a nice soft pliable ball of dough give that a really good mix get some thyme flowers in there and this time is light fragrant and it's just a really nice herb and with the ricotta it tastes brilliant just pick the little tips the time flowers next flour your hands generously and knead the mixture into a dough fold in and push and basically what it's doing is get it nice and smooth as it starts to get a little bit wet and just add a little touch of flour we want something really nice and soft now don't overwork it it stops the nokia from expanding when it hits the pan that's exactly what i want a nice sort of soft fragrant ball cut the ball in half lightly flour the hands and just roll it gently just think of a a big long cigar the mixture will start getting a little bit sort of wetter but do not add lots of flour now lightly flour the knife so when you slice the gnocchi it doesn't stick cut the dough into bite-sized pieces just take your finger dip it in the flour and push down why i want my knocking to look like a pillow and for me the most important part there is that not one of them are identically the same shape water on bring it up to the boil little touch of olive oil in there lightly flour your hand lift up the gnocchi in to the rolling boiling water turn that pan to stop them from sticking at the bottom and let them simmer and they start to sort of tell you they're cooked when they start floating get a pan on get that nice and hot now they're just starting to come up to the top and you can continue cooking them like that i like blanching them in the water take them out and then frying them to study the gnocchi heat olive oil in a frying pan gently lift up and look they've doubled in size drain it get rid of the excess water and straight in to the hot pan [Music] this is where they start to take on a completely different texture nice crisp sauteed texture on the outside nokia loves fresh pepper so pepper in you can see as i start turning them got this really nice little sort of brown color and they almost popping up now like little parcels so i want them nice and sauteed both sides but light and creamy in the center fresh garden peas in and the butter gives it a really nice sort of bernoulli flavor on the end beautiful put a little bit of fresh thyme over the peas and then finally i want to lift it up fresh lemon zest the lemon over smells incredible and then finally seal the deal with a touch of grated parmesan cheese give your vegetable attitude and you'll get amazingly elegant dishes on a budget that are always guaranteed to impress what more do you want from great cooking cheap to make easy to cook and absolutely stunning my next recipe is a proper british classic that's super simple to cook and cost next to nothing a delicious apple crumble crumbles are the perfect way to use fruit when it's in season there's lots of it about it's nice and cheap but most importantly the fruit's at its absolute best [Music] first off i'm gonna make a really nice light caramel pan on nice and low great to apples [Music] this helps to almost sort of pure the apples so much quicker there's a lot of flavor in the skin so don't worry about peeling the fruit whether it's pears plums peaches flavors in the skin nice to start the caramel a couple of tablespoons of sugar the sugar helps to get rid of the tartness in the apple a touch of cinnamon that starts to make it a little spicy open up your vanilla just scrape out all those seeds now this just makes it light and fragrant all those seeds in to the sugar when making caramel be patient and always swirl the dish instead of stirring it when the sugar goes brown add the apple that starts to sort of cool down the caramel but it gives it a really nice sort of caramelised puree apple's almost disintegrating smells incredible turn the gas down slice up two apples it's a crumble that's got no frills straight forward no faffing around no peeling of the skin i want them to sort of stand out from the caramel apples in now those nice thick chunks of apple sort of almost bedding itself into the puree dried cranberries gives it that nice sort of shock in the texture sweet and chewy i want it to sort of taste zesty spicy so sip the lemon zest on top of your apples and cranberry fresh lemon juice over and that just gives that extra acidic kick takes the cranberries the apples the caramel and the cinnamon to another level turn the gas off so that that sits and let's concentrate on the crumble flour in a couple of tablespoons of demerara sugar sugar helps to get the topping nice and crispy butter in [Music] give that a nice little rub what we're looking for is like a a bread crumb mixture lightly season it with a touch of cinnamon and the demerara sugar sort of helps to get a nice fine crumble mix and it stops the butter from sort of melting in that flour so that's the basic crumble mix but i'm not finished yet muesli two-thirds crumble one-third muesli mix that in if you haven't got muesli then crunchy granola works brilliantly too lovely now start off in the center and work your way around i want the crispiness on the top the puree on the bottom of the caramel and then the texture in the center a good tip turn the gas back on i want it bubbling before it goes in the oven because then you just got to cook the top so as soon as you see that caramel start to bubble down the side in she goes let's go bake at 200 degrees celsius for 12 to 14 minutes until golden brown smells amazing [Music] beautiful it's still bubbling [Music] and look at it a delicious but very simple crumble with apples at the absolute best beautiful [Music] you

and deep fry until golden they serve with a watercress fennel and chilli salad and garnish with lemon what's the secret behind a really good empanada i think pastry good chicken good flavor easy to made that's it right barrington talk to me yes chef who taught you to cook first who was this there was all boys and um my mum was before i was a bird so she pulled me to one side and showed me how to call can your mum think that you are and she had a special technique with a wooden spoon what was that well at the beginning my mum says um what you need to do you need to watch the part and every time i used to open my mouth and say something excuse me i chose to say it i didn't ask you to talk i asked you to watch the part it worked i think it worked it did discipline discovery bay in huddersfield is run by barrington douglas whose mum taught him everything there is to know about caribbean cuisine my passion for cooking started off at home with my mum cooking there was five boys no girls and there was one day my mum says right i want somebody to learn how to cook so she put me to one side and that's where it started gentle giant barrington is keen to pass on his knowledge he mentors local young people teaching them how to cook it treats me like one of his sons he's like a dead to me and i do anything for him discovery based starter is jerk chicken caesar salad barrington fries chicken marinaded and jerk seasoning made with scotch bonnet peppers garlic black pepper cinnamon nutmeg thyme and allspice he dresses mixed leaf salad in caesar sauce [Music] now barry what's so special about this recipe what is it is the seasoning on the jerk chicken we do a lot of jerk chicken in in the caribbean yes but this is where i'm just trying to bring it to a little bit of a european taste as well with a caesar salad so would you say your interpretation is more modern more modern more modern so more dangerous more dangerous accent in terms of being in the middle of paris it's like a little sort of communal pocket of argentina yeah we are really friendly and we are like a small family yeah yeah we're going to dance and salsa sometimes yeah are you teaching him was he teaching you no he's teaching okay good four more excellent and how old when you first started cooking um my first time seven years old seven years ago what was the first thing you took one it was peak north and south america are stuffed with the most amazing ingredients here's one of the most delicious [Music] canada in the northern tip of the american continent is home to some of the most delicious wildfowl in the world [Music] with christmas coming up and goose one of my favorite festive foods i couldn't be in a better place quebec where almost a million wild snow geese stop off once a year as they migrate south always been a big fan of british goose however the snow goose is a canadian ancestor and they say taste wise is in a completely different league i can't wait to try it i'm in the town of monmoney where snow goose is so famous it's like the local mascot there are thousands here so i'd like to think they only have the best wild snow goose on the local restaurant menus [Music] very light in color that unfortunately was a bit of a letdown i was expecting more of a sort of richer gamier slightly livery flavor that's the kind of goose you can get anywhere certainly not worth coming all the way to quebec for that's for sure this goose has too much fat on it to be a wild delicacy so i want to grill the head chef frederique to find out where it came from how are you all right you yeah rondi thank you happy to be here yeah but then my goose arrived so that is snow geese no that's firemen geese that's farm geese yeah why are you serving me farm geese when you've got hundreds of thousands of them in your front garden because it's illegal illegal it's not legal we eat at home but we can serve at the restaurant we can't serve the restaurants but that's madness from a chef to chef yeah wild yeah it's completely different it's not the same flavor chalk and cheese yeah because the canadian authorities can't monitor the health of wild snow geese they don't allow restaurants like this one to sell it so the only way i can actually go and eat a wild snow goose if i go and shoot the bloody thing myself yeah to maximise my chances of finding a wild snow goose i headed out of town and further up the st lawrence river this vast waterway is 70 kilometers wide and is prime feeding ground for migrating birds daniela chance has been hunting here since he was a child look at them all there's loads of geeks incredible in the area here about five hundred thousand slogans half a million half a million yeah my god all i want to taste is one that's all i want is one arimo island in the middle of the river is one of daniel's best hunting spots we start at 5 a.m the next morning to get into position before the snow geese spot us trudging our way across the riverbed as soon as the tide goes out the tide's gone out and this mud is bloody deep though yeah really bloody [ __ ] my god a few hours ago these hides below ground were buried deep underwater i've done some pretty crazy things in my life in order to get food but i've never done this i sat in the middle of a river in a box holy crap we sit under cover of darkness waiting for the snow geese to fly in so when we see them do we dive down do we it's really really important not to show our faces because they're pretty smart daniel mimics the call of the geese to try and attract passing birds says go no go cheers oh my god it's really with the troll tear there an hour later as the sun begins to burst through the clouds the snow geese start to fly in and arrive on the riverbed in the thousands [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i just wish one or two of them would land near us [Music] but there must be one how many there probably between ten and fifteen thousand snoogies there oh [ __ ] snow geese have incredibly sharp sight and a keen sense of danger which was keeping them well away from us so we've got fifteen thousand geese sat there and five thousand sat there and we're stuck here yeah who put the box here was it the fringe what the [ __ ] all i want is one one little goose [ __ ] it's the distances these wild birds fly that makes their meat lean and delicious to eat

extraordinary absolutely amazing feedback from the season salad was what um did you love the crouton do you think the chicken was very tender all of you have done fantastically well 23 out of 25 now is where it really goes up a different level really push the boat out yeah well done great start clear down start up make all right now both restaurants are going to cook their main courses first up discovery bay at discovery bay in huddersfield barrington's menu combines classic carving recipes with european ingredients we've got the specials where i try to fuse food together so we might use pastas linguine rocket leaves barrington's ambitious approach to caribbean dining has been a hit with the yorkshire locals it's lovely it's nice to come into a restaurant and sit and eat the food rather than going to like a caribbean cafe the taste in the food when he does it it's just like something it's just like the mother's cooking it's not better sorry check on thank you one rum park barrington's main course is one of his most popular dishes rum pork with sweet potatoes barrington starts by marinating pork medallions with fresh thyme rosemary black pepper chopped garlic and dark rum for the rum gravy heats up beef stock and adds red green and yellow peppers we've got the red yellow and green so we have got the rasaman colours and the colours of the caribbean islands as well running through there and what we've got here we've got the old jamaica room [Music] daryl dew next he griddles of pork medallions and sliced sweet potato he adds the pork medallions to the rum gravy and finishes with cream he serves with steamed vegetables smells absolutely beautiful awake here and please pork with sweet potatoes served so barrington the secret behind this main course is what it's a stock basically it's a reduction of the stock um a nice little kicker what's the heat at the back that's a little bit of scotch bonnet pepper in there okay when you're standing in front of that grill that's a very difficult thing to operate in battersea how do you get the temperature of the steaks cooked perfectly what is this we need to move the grill to that high you have slow middle depends how good the people want so you're not touching the stakes it's all with this yes your tongue is the same when you touch your hands yep when you touch here yep right yeah yep here's what santa maria are cooking tonight at santa maria del sur in south london they use only the finest argentinian beef i think argentinian beef is one of the best in the world because we have so much nice grass nice weather the way the cows eat the way they live makes the beef that tasty and tender you can really taste the difference to any other beef that you can eat this is really excellent table five santa maria's signature dish tonight is argentinian ribeye steak with chimichurri sauce [Music] for the chimichurri ernesto chops parsley and garlic and blends with olive oil something really very nice he adds bay leaves ground sweet red pepper oregano sea salt and mixes he stirs in warm water to infuse the flavors he finishes with white wine vinegar and chopped red onion the chimichurri is the real tasty sauce from argentina ernesto char grills an argentinian ribeye steak and seasons with olive oil and sea salt not too much he serves with a rocket and sugar snap salad dresses with toasted sesame and sunflower seeds chimichurri sauce on the side and garnish the steak with a slice of roasted red pepper now it's done argentinian ribeye steak with chimichurri sauce served health and safety have banned me from having an open fire in my kitchen so i've had a special grill installed why did you choose a ribeye over a fillet or a sirloin because the fat has special flavor and what makes argentinian beef so special what is it about the wettest conditions and is it one of the best meats in the world i think it's the best do you think it's the best yes why not you think it's better than scottish yes you may be better than as a football but i don't know about the steaks however we'll find out later yes yeah yeah bloody smoke in here what we've done to my kitchen it's always like this yes what's the material time all the time all the time honestly it's like you're sending smoke signals huh is that trying to put barrington off what's all that about no yes that's right unless so you happy with them yes they look fantastic yeah away please tell me one let's go now cynthia you have six now three minutes the next table thank you right now back to canada i'm in quebec in north america on the hunt for one of the most delicious birds in the world the snow goose almost a million descend on the salons river for a few weeks each year so far i've had little luck shooting one [Music] a new day and daniel takes me to a new hunting spot this time thankfully on dry land so why don't you bring me here yesterday in a nice little sort of bunker than being sat in the middle of a river sometimes it's better there sometimes it's better here it feels right here yeah well we're uh we're well placed and it's getting nice and white over there isn't it yeah they began to be maybe two or three thousand now so when they fly over i can shoot any one if you want to eat it yeah the gray ones are much more better because they are more tender because they're the youngsters exactly yeah we've just made it 10 times more difficult so it's not just about shooting a snowgies no he's looking for the grey ones exactly young grey geese have migrated fewer miles than older birds so the meat is more tender it isn't long before we get our first chance chew miss that but not bad order will come they're looking good these ones here ready aiming for a straight goose on the move is the best way to ensure we hit just one with a clean shot and finally one came our way oh sure got him [Music] yes yeah [ __ ] i've got my goose but was it the right age and the very best to eat brilliant ah perfect young one for one young wife my god look at that baby there well and how young is that is that the perfect age it's a it's a fresh fresh snow goose of the of the year honestly i'm so pleased to get one that's brilliantly we got one finally ah we got excellent well done beautiful woods huh before i can cook snow goose for the first time daniel shows me how to de-breast the bird now to get the breasts off you just have to pull like that and see everything is coming it's incredible and look how thin that fat is there's hardly any fat on there a lot darker than i expected yeah it's like a red brown meat yeah like venison and the breasts are quite thick as well i thought i thought they'd be thinner close to an inch yup it's incredible christmas is fast approaching and goose is one of my favorite birds to cook and i've got a recipe that'll bring out this wild meat's rich gamey flavor perfectly this is the first for me a delicious lean snow goose breast with a rich red wine tomato sauce finished with sweet potatoes onions and garlic first slice the potatoes and par boil with olive oil and a bit of salt pan on for the goose season the snow goose and fry it with rosemary garlic and butter once it's beautifully colored take it out of the pan now to go with a snow goose under a really nice red wine tomato sauce fry some chopped onions and garlic nice then add red wine to the pan really important to reduce the red wine down to a syrup otherwise you've got that sort of raw alcohol flavor in the sauce add chopped tomatoes and chicken stock and then the snow goose goes back to finish cooking with some butter the butter gives the sauce a nice glaze the snow goose is rich so the soda potatoes will be very simple now the secret to get our skin really nice and crispy they're fried with some chopped onion garlic thyme and butter slice the snow goose nice and thinly now put the sauce on top this is definitely one of the most exciting ingredients i've ever cooked i can't wait to try it that is so delicate yeah incredibly tender it's really delicious yeah it's really great that's given me a completely different taste and experience than i ever could imagine it smells delicious it tastes delicious and also it's very healthy yeah because it's no fat no fat i'm really really really happy with that and what an amazing discovery and thank you i just need one more favor i need to redirect the snow goose via scotland so i don't have to travel so far next time that is incredible but that's really great yeah really good okay good ernesto cynthia last table now yeah yeah yeah four and 16 away yeah they look great they smell delicious now your sauce has started to get darker now is that because you changed the recipe or are you just over a duty quite a bit yeah yeah every plate got to look the same yeah ernesto thank you well done thank you pretty good thank you right well done yeah clear down yeah drink some water job well done thank you jeff i really enjoyed the pork really nice really well cooked and the sauce is gorgeous flavors are amazing um very moorish very like you want to lick your plate literally the sauce was incredible steak was delicious very tender um i like the sauce that was with the chimichurri i hadn't tried that before so it was nice to try that the steak was lush i don't usually like rare steak to be honest with you but um changed my views probably right argentinian beef santa maria briefly cooked lovely colour sauce a little bit of grilled pepper on there that is cooked perfectly it's incredibly juicy mmm and packed full of flavor salad unfortunately a little bit bland slightly boring it's not very nice eating raw onion with the most amazing steak however ernesto really knows your stuff that is perfection discovery bay fillets of pork with a creamy rum sauce and vegetables sat on a bed of sweet potato looks a little bit more complex sauce is delicious pork is delicious as well and i'm so glad you put that rum in there because that really sort of wakes up that richness um tough choice this one if i was the diner and i had to choose between them both i'd have to say i'd go for the steak so the results are in right barrington out of 50. give us a number 45. 45 out of 50. yeah 46.46 one more and discovery bank okay good jb please results okay let's start off with discovery bay so the number

flavors work really well so don't be precious this is gutsy cooking at its absolute best these are lamb breasts a beautiful cheap cut and it's sort of tucked alongside the rib they've been boned out the skin has been taken off i'm going to roll them stuff them and braise them braising simply means cooking in liquid on a low heat making the meat divinely tender now open them up and give them a really good season season them both sides inside and out really important it doesn't look like a real weighty dense cut of meat but once it's beautifully slow braised it's just like melting lamb it's incredible i'm gonna season the breasts with some dried oregano put a heat in there some chili flakes [Music] lemon zest put some amazing salted anchovies in there now they almost melt inside the lamb so the balance of flavors work beautifully now pull it down towards you and roll that nice and tightly that's what i'm looking for string i just need to tie them three times one at each end and one in the middle i fell in love with this dish years ago when i first started working in paris because we had all the lamin from the pyrenees the nice thing is they can be done the day before pan on olive oil in get their oil nice and hot lamb in really important to get some nice color on there whilst they're browning slice the onion the lamb's gonna be cooking for two and a half hours so don't slice the onions too thinly otherwise they'll burn garlic and leave whole got a color on them look at that beautiful take them out onions in and garlic straight in lovely that's the secret about slow braising you never change pans why all the goodness is in that one pan a few chili seeds in there oregano nice pinch a little bit of lemon in there i'm gonna do the onions what i did to the lamb [Music] next my capers fry them off get them exploding the bottom of the pan they get nice and crispy next my black olives now white wine bring that up to the boil deglazing the pan as well i rinse in the bottom of that pan and now the flavour in there it's just extraordinary now where that tomatoes [Music] puncher those plum tomatoes then simply place the lamb breast back in the pot and remember to taste [Music] that's nice [Music] lid on into the oven 170 two two and a half hours and forget about it [Music] whoa beautiful all that has reduced down to this amazing nice tomato sauce and the lamb has kept its color look at that it's braised beautifully very carefully get your little bits there slice off pull off the little bits of string this is why i get really excited the secret is not to slice it too thinly look at that i can smell the lemon it's hard to believe when you slice through the center there that that is a very cheap cut of meat i'm salivating i love this i mean it's just incredible pick up the tomatoes and the olives and the onions an amazing rich sauce take your lamb sort of just sit it on it looks incredible and that for me is why chefs get so excited with cheap cuts because the end results are incredible delicious breast of lamb with lemon anchovies chili and oregano a devilishly indulgent dessert nothing beats a great cake a sort of a show-off trophy for party food so i'm going to make the most amazing flowerless chocolate cake but with a twist first thing first make the caramel flatten the sugar never stir a caramel rule number one now keep the pan nice and flat i'm gonna flavor this caramel with a little bit of mint give it a little chop sprinkle that into the caramel don't get the caramel too dark just nice and light a little teaspoon of oil onto the tray and rub that in and then pour out your caramel if i was making a caramel sauce then i'd put butter and cream into the caramel but i want this nice minted brittle running through my cake whilst the caramel cools down on the tray i'm gonna make my cake first melt good quality dark chocolate in a bain-marie heating it directly in the pan would destroy the cocoa fats always in a bowl over boiling water in a mixing bowl sugar two whole eggs and three egg yolks whisk until beautifully light and creamy and the color changes to a light yellow the more you mix the eggs and the sugar the lighter that texture in the center of the chocolate cake next melt some butter into your warm dark chocolate and stir was that really nice sheen velvety rich and tasting amazing add that to your sugar and your eggs now give that a really good mix now when you're making flourless desserts it really is important to work harder incorporating the air especially with the yolks and the sugar that natural height needs to take place at the beginning look at that looks like the perfect chocolate ganache then separate four egg whites into a bowl [Music] now make sure you've got two-thirds of the way there with your whites and then just sprinkle in your sugar it's almost like a meringue and the firmer you make these now the more it will elevate your cake in the oven [Music] that's what you call a stiff peak in with the whites before i start mixing that i'm gonna get my caramel just start breaking that up it's like glass sheets of glass beautiful save some of your minty caramel shards for decoration and use a rolling pin to break up the rest into small pieces sprinkle that in so as we start to slice that chocolate cake you'll come across that nice crunch take your cake tin make sure it's lined with the greaseproof paper on the bottom nicely greased pour this in a few sharp taps on a hard surface will rid your cake mixture of any air pockets that could create holes in your cake sit that in the oven 180. after 35 minutes my chocolate mint cake is cooked and whilst it cools down i can whip up a peppermint cream topping [Music] add sifted icing sugar and a few drops of peppermint extract to double cream and whisk until it's just holding its shape your minty cream on top of the cake leaving a small border free to make it easier to cut for a cake that can't fail to attract attention at your party scatter over the remaining caramel mint shards we've got aromatic lean lamb chops with char grilled broccoli and burger wheat salad for dessert it's healthy mango sundae holly [Music] then i can help daddy with the dessert yes please and the lamb cutlets now we all know that you love desserts yeah yeah we'll do a little yogurt parfait with some macerated fruits so the first thing i'd like you to do is take a tablespoon of icing sugar dust that over the fruits good now sad enough that's perfect daddy thank you zest the orange over the fruits and what's going to happen now is going to start to sort of marinate i'm going to put some basil in there that'll make it really flavoursome fresh basil in and then i'm going to give that a little mix up i'm going to squeeze some fresh orange juice in there nice and gently okay how gorgeous do those berries look now okay so we just leave them just marinate okay and that's what we call macerated berries now for the mango sundae right mangoes in place i love mangoes nice now they're naturally sweet okay one oh that smells incredible now how fresh does that smell very no you love art right yeah i do so you're gonna put these together so a nice little dollop of mango at the bottom nice and slowly once each glass has a layer of mango puree at the bottom spoon over a layer of thick natural yogurt and alternate until the glass is full well done now it's yummy from there you get your berries you sit your berries on top they taste so fresh but now they've been marinated and the berries have been slightly macerated and then finally look get your icing sugar and just tap on top they look it's beautiful now they sit in the fridge to get nice and chilled okay so if i take three and promise not to sneeze and you take one open the fridge door good job desserts chilling in the fridge now for the super simple main course to go with the aromatic lamb chops a tasty char grill broccoli and bulgur wheat salad to cook the bulgur wheat just simmer until tender then drain to give the broccoli a char grilled flavor simply cook with salt in a hot dry pan until smoky and tender for a quick and easy aromatic dressing mixed together harissa paste with either buttermilk or creme fraiche and add chopped mint simple as that to serve thoroughly dress your broccoli and burger wheat and finish with more fresh mint leaves dessert ready and salad's done now for the aromatic grilled lamb chops how much do you love lamb holes a lot a lot on a scale of one to ten ten okay these lamb chops are gonna be delicious first i'm gonna marinate them i'll start putting the spices in yeah first one coriander coriander good so a teaspoon of coriander seeds in a little touch of what's that human human well done cumin in one of daddy's favorites turmeric chew me a teaspoon of that in there now a little touch of salt and then i want you to start grinding that down while i get the ginger and the garlic give that a nice little mix please for daddy that looks amazing after that get the garlic lay it flat and look it almost purees the garlic so we get a nice paste see underneath sorry about dirting your nails it's okay i just smell like garlic now nothing wrong with that the more you smell of garlic the less the boys are gonna date you sorry right now the ginger makes it sort of spicy and fruity now get the ginger and do exactly the same with the ginger when you grate it like this it turns into the most amazing ginger puree off your diet come on holly put some muscle into it good girl nice see

taste amazing but more importantly they are so simple to do pan on for the stuffing it's a saddle of lamb basically a sort of rolls-royce cut perfectly shaped and it suits stuffing to an absolute tea for the stuffing finely chop an onion garlic nice thin slices oil in onions and garlic in [Music] salt and pepper make sure the stuffing is beautifully seasoned so it helps to season the inside of the lamp now we've got the color on those onions we're going to throw in some pine nuts and that helps to give a bit of a texture here's where it starts getting really exciting spinach in and just lay the spinach over the pine nuts it looks like a lot of spinach that's going to condense and disappear almost instantly there's so much more flavor and spinach when you saute it as opposed to steaming it or boiling it gas off look at that now to bring that together no eggs no breadcrumbs crumbled feta over the spinach feta cheese adds a beautifully salty sharp and creamy flavor what this does it brings our stuffing together now open up the lamb keep those little fillets to the side that's the channel that we want to stuff so i want to just open that up a little bit there salt and pepper lightly and before we put our stuffing in we're going to season it with sour sumac is a wonderful lemony spice that goes brilliantly with lamb and you can get it in most big supermarkets and it sort of cuts through that thick rich sweetness of the lamb open up that lamb there take a spoon if you're preparing this for the day ahead then let the stuffing cool down it's inevitable when you start rolling it and tying it something's gonna squeeze out so load up the ends take these beauties these little fillets and just support that stuffing and sort of increase that beautiful tunnel and then from there over there and bring that towards you and then roll like i said some of the stuff is going to come out now to tie it first off around the side and don't worry about some flash butcher's knot just tie it one in the middle you can get butcher's string from your local butcher or at cookware shops i got two ties go to thai it just forces all that stuffing out of the lamb when it's in the oven nice now we'll just season the top of it roll the joint to make sure all the skin gets seasoned now you think normally that just goes in the oven like that that's how my mum would do it but get your tray onto the gas oil in get it really nicely colored none of your stuffing is coming out the sides really important look at that color beautiful it does kick start the roasting process gas off into the oven cook for 45 to 55 minutes depending on how pink you want your lamb lift the lamb out of the fat to rest resting it raised up in the tin will stop it cooking but not cool it down too quickly and means you won't lose any of those lovely juices next i'm making a simple but sophisticated accompaniment for the lamb top and tail the cucumber peel it cut the cucumber into three and just core taking out all that it's just sort of watery seedy and it spoils the flavor slice the cucumber cucumber in really nice way of making a cheap and cheerful cucumber look glamorous we're gonna dress that cucumber with a nice fresh yogurt couple of tablespoons next some fresh mint dressing a touch of salt a touch of pepper and then pomegranate molasses that just sweetens it up finish that with lemon mix that up lamb it's rested carefully take off the string and then just gently pull them back straighted edge knife that's going to cut through that crispy fat on the outside instantly i tied it purposely so i can get my portion control from the lines hold it nice and firmly look at your line where the string was and look this one is going to be amazing lay and down just in those two slices there it proves that stuffing meat is for special occasions because that is a saddle of lamb at its absolute best stuffing meats and fish not only makes them look fantastic it also gives them an extra added flavor dimension too once you've mastered the technique you'll be able to turn out dishes that will guarantee you'll have an unforgettable feast slow-cooked fiery lamb cooking is all about being bold and adventurous and this dish is exciting because it's slowly cooked and the longer it cooks the more flavoursome it becomes marinating the lamb first chilis we're gonna use a mixture of red and green take off the tops and just slice in garlic crushed don't worry about chopping these ultra fine just get it in there cooking for up to three hours everything sort of blends and almost sort of purees itself together smoked paprika goes brilliantly well with the chilis two teaspoons in a touch of dried oregano some little cumin seeds the blend and the fragrance that they give out is extraordinary they release a little oil as well and helps to tenderize the lamb a touch of salt pepper cinnamon that sort of sweetens up the lamb olive oil just a tablespoon and the olive oil helps to sort of stick all those wonderful spices to the lamb jump in just start really rubbing at this stage you can leave the lamb to marinade for anything from half an hour to overnight allowing the spices to really penetrate the meat giving amazing results when you tuck in delicious vegetables carrots and onions and that's it sliced secret slicing vegetables from braising is not getting too thin you slice the onions too thin they burn you've got that horrible char taste on that slow braised braising it's just a chef's term that means cooking in liquid on a low heat making the meat incredibly moist and beautifully tender so the secret of braising is having a really nice thick durable pan get that nice and hot just a touch of olive oil lamb in hold the bone because you're in control then into the pan i want that white fat to start rendering so it'll add more fat therefore making it a lot more flavoursome as it braises chilies cinnamon in mix that up and don't be scared you're not burning this you're sort of searing the lamb shanks and this is the important part right at the very beginning we're getting the collar on the lamb which washes off as it braises in the oven so be generous with that color vegetables in wow and then a couple of baileys so now you lift the lamb up and get the lamb sat on top of the vegetables now just glaze the pan with red wine this glazing means that you're you're cleaning the bottom of the pan and you're getting that amazing flavor washed off and lifted up into that sauce can really transform that dish always delays then bring to the boil and cook for about 10 minutes to reduce the wines reduce down by half now for the stock bring that stock back up to the ball and then into the oven now don't cover it when you cover it all the condensation comes off the lid your lamb becomes gray all this effort and that exciting spice gets washed away no lid and in the oven for three hours a slow cook on a low heat of 160 degrees gives the spices time to work and transform the meat so it's mouthwateringly tender now look at those out on to a plate you can just see that meat sliding down juicy and incredibly tender grab it by the the shank rolling around that rich delicious sauce look at that and get your sauce nice beautiful just get some mint don't chop it just pick that fresh mint and let it snow and there you go a very spicy delicious melting in the mouth lamb shank amazing sponge with fresh ginger bacon is part chemistry part imagination but you've got to rely on the rules for great results the only time you'll see me reaching for the scales first off eggs sugar butter and when i say weigh out the ingredients it does literally mean way out to the final gram 175 now 175 grams of sugar that's 350 grams in total cream the butter and the sugar to get a delicious light sponge start carefully on slow speed [Music] only speed up as the butter and sugar really start to cream together keep that really nice and light you can see how it's changed color so important at the beginning eggs in give me a little whisk adding one egg at a time stops the mix from separating second egg in third one in [Music] that's what we're looking for a really nice sort of light airy texture now i'm gonna flavor the sponge a little teaspoon of vanilla extract that perfumes the mix one teaspoon of baking powder that gives lightness 175 grams of flour and we're going to sieve it a to get rid of any lumps and b to keep it really nice and fine 175. we're not going to beat that out we're just going to lightly fold that in now what i'm looking for is a really nice loose dough that's looking a little bit too firm so just a little splash of milk a couple of tablespoons that relaxes the mixture down helps create that nice almost dropping consistency that's what i want just starting to drop take a non-stick loose bottom cake tin grease it with butter then coat it with flour to avoid the sponge sticking just give that a little shake make sure you get all the rim now just get the back of the spatula make sure you've got no peaks on my sponge to make sure the sponge bakes nice and evenly tap the tin a few times to knock out any air pockets that might have formed in the mixture now into the oven bake for 30 to 35 minutes at 180 degrees as that's cooking prepare the ginger cream for the center 300ml of cream give that a nice whisk whisking the cream by hand gives you so much more control and it's so easy to over whipped cream i want that nice light ginger cream in the center i don't want it grainy nothing worse when cream starts to separate now let's get into that three-quarter stage little stiff peaks stop that for two minutes fresh ginger now get a really nice large slice of ginger smells incredible it's so fragrant good green ginger is like sort of peeling a potato just take out all those little dark spots now get your grater you haven't gotten grater you can chop the ginger really finely i've gone almost like a puree of ginger going through but the juice as well take your knife and just scrape all that taste incredible it's fragrant it's not sweet it's got a really nice taste set that in the fridge [Music] smells incredible run a knife around the outside to ensure the cake doesn't stick to the tin before turning it out now get your hands under push up and out while your cake cools i'm gonna do like a really nice sweet chocolate coating pour 300 mils of double cream into a saucepan add two tablespoons of golden syrup to make the top nice and glossy then whisk chop this up really thinly so as it melts quickly 50 grams of butter that's gonna give the chocolate a really nice shine ball your cream and mix it in give that a really good stir as the chocolate the butter melts it thickens like how shiny that is it's so nice to finish something sweet on top topping done time to build your sponge cake look at the halfway mark there and just gently slice and really take your time all the way through lift that's delicious a nice big dollop in the middle don't be stingy don't be tight with a cream another dollop on top spread that very carefully lift the lid and just sit that on top that's why i start off with a little extra cream in there so i squash it down the cream just pushes out to the side i'm not finished pour the luxurious chocolate topping over the sponge be generous and make sure the cake is coated thoroughly to give it a gorgeous finish get the bottom of the ladle and spread whoa one more [Music] wow you've got to know when to say stop and something looks that delicious i just want to dive in there wonderful baked cheesecake for me food always has to be impressive but when it comes to desserts often you see spun sugar or wild decorations remember simple is always the most impressive this cheesecake is so straightforward yet so delicious now cream cheese leave it out the fridge for five or ten minutes go nice and soft trust me your arms will be thanking you sugar in this cheesecake is the new york cheesecake because it's baked so there's no base start creaming the cheese and the sugar spending the amount of time i do in the states if there's one thing they know how to do out there is the most amazing impressive cheesecake rich delicious but so simple work the bowl lift the bowl to your advantage whisk whisk whisk whisk lovely nice and creamy now get your eggs add the eggs to the mixture bit by bit doing it this way it's more efficient hey you're incorporating a lot of air b the mixture doesn't separate lastly your egg lovely of course you can use electric mixer but why go to the gym we can just make a cheesecake a day a cheesecake a day keep the bingo wings away now a couple of tablespoons of flour give it a whisk stop something going lumpy now i want to scent that cheesecake i've got the freshness zest of the lemon in there i want to sort of tart it up even more fold in some fresh raspberries so just mix them through be careful to crush them then grease a cake tin with butter this will ensure your cheesecake slides out beautifully get your mix let that fall in now take your cake tin and just tap it the mixture hits the bottom of the cake tin the raspberries rise and you've got raspberries at the top the middle and the bottom it also stops all these little pockets of air trapping underneath the mixture in the cake tin there's no holes in the cheesecake now into the oven 180 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes [Music] slightly souffled up pull off [Music] that's the color i wanted on top and look at it it's one of the simplest yet the most stylish cheesecakes anywhere beautiful [Music]

For breakfast, there are Smoked haddock & spinach baked eggs. Lunch is a delicious Roasted tomato soup and for dinner, there's...",2022-11-28 22:16:02.926159, [Music] smoked haddock one of my favorite fish delicious highly sustainable packed with protein lightly smoked there's not a dye smoke there's a big difference so you haven't got that bright yellow tinge so much better next baby spinach there's a spinach that's very young full of zinc great flavor little teaspoon volleyball knob of butter that little touch of oil stops the butter from burning it looks like a lot of spinach but it's going to disintegrate almost by two-thirds i'm cooking spinach in butter open up the top of my pepper mill so the pepper becomes almost like sort of cracked pepper lots of fine once your spinach has reduced down by two-thirds add in your cubes of smoked haddock tarragon it's got that nice vinegary flavor quite tart pick off the little buds from the stalks keep hold of these and grateful when you're making italian vinegar red wine vinegar tarragon stalks in chop the tarragon into your creme fraiche little season now grain mustard goes brilliantly well with havoc incredible this mustardy herbie creme fresh will work equally well partnered with grilled chicken the haddock's starting to flake because it's smoked lightly cured it cooks so quickly your creme it's fraiche now it's almost like the beginning of the perfect fish pie but as opposed to putting pastry on top the eggs are going to bake on top so you've got this wonderful egg crust turn the gas off now crack your eggs around the outside just a little twist of pepper get the remainder of your cream fresh and put a little dollop in between that adds richness to the egg whites into the oven at 180 for 10 to 12 minutes [Music] whilst the haddock and eggs bake together i can knock up a simple spring onion garnish in professional kitchen chefs refuse to use the top of the spring onions but i love that nice dark green flavor it's less harsh than the white the smell of baked mustard you can't beat [Music] that is beautiful spinach has almost melted in with a hat up now just sprinkle your spring onions that gives that really nice sharpness wow my ultimate hearty breakfast smoked haddock and spinach baked eggs so packed with protein and iron you'll be raring to dive into the day ahead [Music] roasted tomato soup beautiful vine tomatoes the riper the tomatoes the better the soup take the core out get your thumb and place it half a centimetre underneath the tip of your knife place it in and then just twist around that's the only part of the tomato that we're not using red onion and garlic red onion because it's sweeter than a white onion slice your onions and your garlic nice and fine traditionally be making it in a pot it's so much better to start it off on top of the stove the searing the tomatoes and the garlic when it goes in the oven you actually roast the tomatoes and they don't stew there's a big difference in flavor be quite generous with the olive oil it makes the soup nice and glossy shiny salt pepper and then a little teaspoon of cayenne just gives it that heat but it's not as fierce as chilli take your tomatoes and just slice them in half and then a little touch of sugar that's gonna help intensify the sweetness a little sprinkle of aged bottled vinegar gives that nice dark rich acidity to the soup into the oven 20 25 minutes 180. to make my soup even more irresistible i'm going to make a punchy sun-dried tomato pesto to drizzle over the top now i'm making this in a pestle and mortar because you feel so much more in control and you're not depending on a blade that's whizzing around at a thousand miles an hour next in a dry pan toast off some pine nuts toast them the absolute max and then in the smell in there is incredible parmesan lightly grate that this is where it starts to become creamy extra virgin olive oil doesn't need salt because the parmesan is going to season it for you and just take a couple of tablespoons of the oil the sun-dried tomatoes are in really helps to make that stunning pesto i can smell those roasted tomatoes want them out wow next pour in a little vegetable stock or chicken stock so it sits halfway up the tomatoes put your spoon through those tomatoes they break up instantly bring that up to the boil let it simmer for three or four minutes i want to make it a little bit more creamy now cream in give that a little stir you can keep it rustic and you get your masher in and you've got that nice thick rich chunky tomato soup or get yourself a stick blender blitzing it like that you delays the bottom of the pan and you get all those amazing flavors from the bottom that's delicious to make my lunch extra hearty i'm going to knock up a deliciously gutsy version of cheese on toast to go with my tomato soup boss rabbit an absolute classic i'm gonna make a roux 50 grams of butter three nice tablespoons of flour and that's all aru is basically traditionally you would use flour butter and milk but in welsh rabbit the milk is often cheekily substituted for a stiff slug of stout gives it that strong gutsy flavor i want it nice and thick make sure those lumps are out a nice teaspoon of dijon mustard and then season it nice and spicy moisture sauce gives it that delicious intriguing flavor now that smells amazing almost brings tears to your eyes beautiful now boss rabbit wouldn't be a stunning welsh rabbit without rich mature cheese soap and a great montgomery cheddar goes well with a beer and drop that in really important to put this in while the roux is still nice and hot because the cheese melts now for the bread i prefer a good rustic country loaf that will stand up to my hardcore topping i want that nice crisp base to my welsh rabbit so toast it both sides [Music] spread that beautiful cheesy berry spicy mixture just great got a blister and bubble congratonate god a little splash alien perry and back under the krill for 90 seconds in one delicious creamy roasted tomato soup it's coming back to me all those days i had off school i used to purposely lie about feeling ill just to get a bowl of my mother's tomato soup how bad was that but my god it was worth it oh now my welsh rabbit [Music] look at those babies that just takes cheese on toast to another level wow roasted creamy tomato soup with a sun-dried tomato pesto served with the most amazing

angle it's a little bit of texture running through the mixture i want that nice crunch in coriander just slice through nice and gently and get that in there next to the sweetcorn now drain it from the

evenly around the pan in a clockwise direction so you always know which one to turn first just with the back of your spoon sort of spread them out a little bit okay palette knife just check and happy with the color and turn over beautiful now for the chili yogurt dressing deseed and finely chop a red chilli and add to a pot of natural yogurt and then some fresh lime [Music] finish with chopped coriander coriander in and give that a nice mix up that chilli just lifts it the lime gives it that nice tanginess the fritters they smell amazing and with the sauce tastes fantastic that is such a delicious recipe using a tin of sweet corn from your cupboard amazing beef tacos with wasabi mayo the great thing about street food is anything goes the only rule is they've got to be really fast and really tasty now these tacos mix a mexican and japanese flavors into a delicious meaty mouthful first off get that pan really nice and hot these are sirloin steaks sear it in the pan with all that fat on i'll add flavor salt and pepper couple tablespoons of olive oil in pan nice and hot hold up the steak and lay it in always lay away give the pan a little shake and it stops the steak from sticking we're looking for color and if it sticks it's gonna burn [Music] while the steaks are cooking i can get on with my super quick marinade now two tablespoons of misood paste that's a fermented soybean that gives a really nice sort of rich sweetness tablespoon of sugar a couple of tablespoons rice wine that gives it a really nice vinegary kick a couple of tablespoons of olive oil salt and pepper i'm looking for a nice sort of thick rich marinade marinade done it's time to turn the steaks sort the pan and to give the steaks a little base all we're doing every time is just adding more and more flavor take your tongs and sort of lift the steak on its back and really melt all that fat down off of the gas take them out just take your knife see all that fat there just slice that off i don't want any of that now in to the marinade [Music] beautiful tacos are one of mexico's most popular street foods they've been made from beef pork chicken or fish and are loaded up with amazing sauces and spices now i want something sort of pickly cabbage these are chinese cabbages slice it in half and look at it really crisp and really tasty we're going to slice that into quarters and then just shred it and take your time you think of cabbage here and you think of sort of braised overcooked cabbage nothing worse but at a taco you want freshness a little season chili flakes they sort of discreetly give it a little bit of heat a little touch of rice wine vinegar if you haven't got that fresh lemon juice a small drop of toasted sesame seed oil give that a really good mix now i need something to sort of bring it together we take some wasabi paste very hot very spicy a sort of thumbnail size i'm gonna mix that with a couple of tablespoons of mayonnaise and give that a really good mix these are basic corn tortilla the trick is to sort of color them and then shape them actually place it on the gas ring use some tongs so as not to burn yourself you can also toast your tacos in a frying pan from there i'm just gonna place it on the rolling pin literally 30 seconds as it cools down the great thing about serving tacos is people can fill them themselves just the way they want them cabbage just squeeze out wet marinade a nice rustic little mountain mayonnaise on wait you see how soft and delicious and almost sort of melting in the mouth texture we've got on this amazing sirloin look at that really nice sear around the outside it's just nice and pink in the middle start off with my crispy shell back of the spoon with the wasabi mayonnaise inside taco and just sprinkle that delicious pickled cabbage and then just start lining my taco three or four slices touch more on my spicy layer and that is how i'd make the perfect taco [Music] my flavor packed lamb with fried bread whether i'm cooking high-end dishes or rustic dishes trust me it all has to be impressive so this lamb dish proves that you don't have to spend a fortune to create delicious food first off put the pan on this is a lamb steak and it's cut just above the leg just here cause you can see that delicious bone running through the center and that's full of marrow so that just gives the lamb a nice added sweet flavor just take your knife cut through each end this stops the lamb steak from buckling so therefore it cooks evenly and colors beautifully salt and pepper lamb needs quite a lot of help with the pepper so be quite generous with the pepper and just pat that down the pan's just under smoke on the outside now put the oil in get that pan really nice and hot because this is a cheap cut so i'm depending on the color of the lamb steak to really sort of impart a lot of flavor that's the noise you want to hear you can't hear that noise don't drop a steak in put a little bit of garlic in there not chopped garlic just whole cloves the garlic lightly crushed don't even waste time peeling them in tongs lift up that bit of fat around the back that's the top of the leg tilt the pan and let all that fat render rendering is a chef's term that means melting the fat it works brilliantly when you're cooking a rib eye as well turn it over that color there beautiful now it looks like an expensive cut and we've got that nice even sear all over as it's cooking just tilt the pan and base and basting the lamb steak just means you're sort of adding all that nice scented garlic olive oil back into the lamb useful now take the lamb out and let the lamb rest [Music] now for the perfect rustic crouton so this bread's quite firm a couple of days old just slice it straight down the center dice it up put it into a bowl season it beautifully [Music] from there i'm gonna add some milk sounds strange adding milk to crouton but it just gives it that nice rich creamy texture and just let that milk sort of absorb into the bread while that's soaking i'm gonna make the dressing go back to that initial garlic that was in the pan look at that beautiful into the pest and water anchovies anchovies go brilliantly well with lamb i want that nice salty vinegary flavor and a bit of kick some capers the little baby cats very sweet now just pound that to a nice paste that smells incredible next some dijon mustard a nice teaspoon and a half in a little bit of red wine vinegar two tablespoons and then our extra virgin olive oil now it's got that heat in there i've got a nice roasted garlic they're all hearty chunky vinaigrette that sort of seeps into that lamb some fresh parsley crunch up the parsley delicious flavour parsley in nice now get your pan hot for the croutons olive oil in the pan grab the croutons and squeeze all that excess milk out not too hard i don't want them dry and in and then just fry them and the milk inside these croutons give it a nice spongy creamy delicious flavor that's the color i want nice now take them out and lightly drain them a little bit of kitchen roll onto the board out [Music] it's a plateman just take it's amazing vinaigrette and spread it get those croutons listen to them like little boulders hitting the play the lamb sit that on next one on the rest of the croutons on now use all those little bits and my chef in paris would kill me right now if you saw me using those because they're the ugly scraps that customers should never see but but they're the best bits croutons on and then just drop that sauce on all those little bits of the lamb and there that is a perfect way of taking a cheap cut is the premier league of dishes

incredible way to transform meat into mouth-wateringly melting dishes mastering the art of slow cooking is something every cook should learn first up my phenomenal slow cooked beef short ribs slow cooking is a brilliant way of getting lots of extra depth and intensity into your dishes the secret is to lock in all those flavors at the start and let the ingredients do their thing as it cooks these are beef short ribs and there's basically five to six bones across there and as the short rib cooks it sticks to that bone the bone implants flavor and the meat just sort of melts cooks slowly gives it that nice level intensity slice alongside the bone straight down you can see that marbling that sort of disappears and disintegrates i'm cooking them in a roasting tray get it on the heat until nice and hot season these short ribs beautifully olive oil in bone on the top we'll start coloring that in [Music] it's really important to give the beef short rib a really nice sear if you didn't brown the meat off it goes in the oven and it looks like boiled meat so you really want that nice dark rich coloring just cut the garlic in half slide that down the side that's going to give that beef an amazing flavor [Music] to give body to the sauce stir in a heaped teaspoon of tomato puree i'm just hitting the bottom of the pan with that tomato puree and we call it cooking out but smell a puree otherwise it just goes in there raw and it gives this sort of tartness to the braised short ribs red wine in don't use an expensive bottle of red wine there's no need bring the wine up to the boil and reduce it this burns off the alcohol and concentrates the flavor it makes a big difference when you reduce the red wine down by half because it gives that nice dark rich intensity look at my garlic that is just gonna sweeten everything up incredible stock in beef stock perfect chicken stock fine just to about an inch underneath the beef short ribs bring it up to the ball to lock in all that flavor as the beef ribs slow cook cover them so they braise from the bottom and steam from the top into the oven two and a half hours 170 to 180 degrees in she goes the great thing about slow cooking is you do most of the work in advance and then put your feet up five or ten minutes before the beef short ribs come out of the oven start your garnish it's a light cured pancetta i want nice thick lardons nice big thick sticks of crispy bacon [Music] these are delicious chestnut mushrooms i'm not going to slice them i'm just going to cut them in half but look at the color on those lardons now all the whites raw fat have disappeared the lardons have shrunk right down and all we've got there now is the proper bacon mushrooms in beautiful so the mushrooms get seasoned from the bacon i'm pan frying these separately to the beef so they remain crisp and have a different texture [Music] leave that to cool down now this is like christmas day for me when you unwrap that fall wait you see what's underneath it [Music] wow they smell incredible lift and place on the tray beautiful to make a fantastic rich deep sauce press the soft roasted garlic through a sieve into the cooking juices all that nice pureed garlic coming through there because that is going to make the most amazing flavor scrape all of that off the sieve nice then just start sieving all that lovely braising liquor wow in that smells delicious take your sauce and just glaze do them individually they deserve that respect spoon on your bacon and your mushrooms [Music] useful be generous with these mushrooms i'm telling you they taste amazing flat leaf parsley all that freshness over those amazing ribs incredible never ever be embarrassed about going to your butcher and asking for cheap cuts because the results are incredible amazing beef braised short ribs with bacon and mushrooms delicious slow braised stuffed lamb breast one of the secrets to slow cooking is to be robust and really get stuck in big bold flavors work really well so don't be precious this is gutsy cooking at its absolute best these are lamb breasts a beautiful cheap cut and it's sort of tucked alongside the rib they've been boned out the skin has been taken off i'm going to roll them stuff them and braise them braising simply means cooking in liquid on a low heat making the meat divinely tender now open them up and give them a really good season season them both sides inside and out really important it doesn't look like a real weighty dense cut of meat but once it's beautifully slow braised it's just like melting lamb it's incredible i'm going to season the breast with some dried oregano put a heat in there some chili flakes [Music] lemon zest there's some amazing salted anchovies in there now they almost melt inside the lamb so the balance of flavors work beautifully now pull it down towards you and roll that nice and tightly that's what i'm looking for string i just need to tie them three times one at each end and one in the middle i fell in love with this dish years ago when i first started working in paris because we had all the lamb in from the pyrenees nice thing is they can be done the day before pan on olive oil in get that oil nice and hot lamb in really important to get some nice color on there whilst they're browning slice the onion the lamb's gonna be cooking for two and a half hours so don't slice the onions too thinly otherwise they'll burn garlic and leave whole got a color on them look at that beautiful take them out onions in and garlic straight in that's the secret about slow braising you never change pans why all the goodness is in that one pan a few chili seeds in there oregano nice pinch a little bit of lemon in there i'm gonna do the onions what i did to the lamb [Music] next my capers fry them off get them exploding the bottom of the pan they get nice and crispy next my black olives now white wine bring that up to the boil delays in the pan as well i rinse in the bottom of that pan and now the flavour in there is just extraordinary now where that tomatoes [Music] puncher those plum tomatoes [Music] then simply place the lamb breast back in the pot and remember to taste [Music] that's nice [Music] lid on into the oven 170 two two and a half hours and forget about it [Music] whoa beautiful all that has reduced down to this amazing nice tomato sauce and the lamb has kept its color look at that it's braised beautifully very carefully get your little bits there slice off pull off the little bits of string this is why i get really excited the secret is not to slice it too thinly look at that i can smell the lemon it's hard to believe when you slice through the center there that that is a very cheap cut of meat i'm salivating i love this i mean it's just incredible pick up the tomatoes and the olives and the onions an amazing rich sauce take your lamb sort of just sit it on it looks incredible and that for me is why chefs get so excited with cheap cuts because the end results are incredible delicious breast of lamb with lemon anchovies chili and oregano [Music] my next recipe turns what used to be a decidedly unfashionable cut of meat into the star of the dish fit to grace any table slow roasted pork belly with fennel [Music] slow roasting works better on fattier tougher and unfashionable cuts whether it's a cheek or even a neck or this amazing pork belly it's a fantastic way to transform cheap cuts into amazing melting perfection take a very sharp knife bring the pork belly towards you so you're over it and you've got all that pressure and weight using the tip of the knife i'm just sort of nicking it and go across the pork belly long strokes with a knife take your time turn it 180. this time what we're doing is just sort of cutting these nice little sort of diamonds but as that starts roasting on top it starts getting nice and crispy take your handfuls of salt and just sort of rub it in bend it over and in all those cracks really helps to get a nice crisp crackling on top roasting tray getting really nice and hot take a hole over fennel to intensify flavor and to keep the meat succulent i'm braising my pork belly with strong vibrant spices and vegetables crush and peel three whole cloves of garlic and add to the fennel olive oil in fennel in i like the nice strong aniseed flavor that goes with that nice rich dense pork fennel seeds delicious star anise in and just a couple of cardamom seeds and wow they're like little bangers like little firecrackers incredible lovely fresh bay leaves get your pork skin side down just sear the top of that fat that locks in all that amazing flavor then i'm going to flip it over and get it nice and crispy and then i want fennel seeds embedded in those little cracks now some white wine a minute that white wine hits that pan you can smell that light fragrance from the fennel allow the wine to bubble away and reduce until the alcohol has burnt off time that the stock now the stock goes in just underneath the skin so it roasts on top all that meat under there will be submerged because what happens in the oven the top goes crispy as anything and the stock reduces and braises at the same time really importantly bring that back up to the ball before it goes in the oven otherwise it will never boil never get up to temperature smells incredible slow roast the pork belly at 180 degrees for two and a half hours [Music] look at that you've got that nice crispy skin on top you can see how much of the stock has evaporated put that onto the board it looks stunning to make a delicious rustic sauce with the flavor packed contents of the roasting tray first get rid of the excess fat take a couple of slices of bread it's like a perfect sponge because you just lay that on top and drag it almost like a net and it just absorbs all that fat if you want the perfect fried bread trust me stick that in a frying pan a nice teaspoon of mustard whisk that in and then simply simmer for a few minutes before pouring into a serving jug with your pork belly always use a nice serrated edge knife you can hear that that is amazing incredibly tender that belly of pork is gonna almost melt in your mouth you've got that sweet meat under that crispy belly of pork what an amazing way to cook a very cheap cut of meat [Music] you

i absolutely love it but that doesn't mean it can't be improved to make the most out of my roast my main course is the delicious stuffed roast rib of beef complete with tangy horseradish yorkshire puddings [Music] but first i'm enlisting the help of my eldest 15 year old megan to reinvent one of my all-time favorite classic desserts eaton mess bomb right eat a mess what's the one thing you love about is a mess i love the meringues now this is a eaten mess with a twist what's the twist in it compared to the normal one we're gonna freeze it so it's almost like a sort of eaten mess bomb wow now i'd like you to whisk the cream please half the strawberries are going to go through the mix and half the strawberries are going to be turned into a coulis strawberries in first a little dusting of icing sugar into the pan and now the icing sugar will withdraw the sweetness from the strawberries and start caramelizing so let me show you a nice quick way of whisking secret whisking is like 10 seconds on and 10 seconds off that way your arms don't get tired now i'm going to take the cream to a three-quarter stage what is a three-quarter mix so we leave some sort of texture in the cream that's what we call three-quarter whip you've got a nice soft peak they're caramelized there you go we'll put a little touch of water in there that'll help break down the sugar and turn that into a really nice strawberry liquid now to get it really nice and fine i'm gonna blend it on and blitz off okay that's fine i want you to use the back of the spoon and push that through the sieve okay now that way you don't get those seeds it smells so good i love this now nice this is the exciting part hold up oh mag megan right now the meringue with your fingers just crush and flake the meringue into the cream how big should i crush it dado there nice big chunks okay lovely oh you okay yeah come on rang in my eye damn to make this dessert even easier i often cheat by using good quality shop port meringues a little taste that's just cream and meringue wow it's a little tasty okay strawberries in next a couple of spoons of the cooling now look at that now to prepare the mold to transform the traditional eaten mess into a frozen bomb form a triple layer of clim film adding water to the bowl will help the climb film stick as i pour that in i want you to spread it down okay at the bottom and push it down can you hear that crunch yeah the line all right now fold the cling film over put that in the freezer please make young please in the freezer she goes [Music] dessert done now for our main course with a twist that is the rib eye we've had that in the fridge not wrapped so it sort of almost air dries and it intensifies the flavor gross so much quicker and there's less water in the beef for me the only downside to perfect roast dinner is the fight about who washes up afterwards so meg and i are going to avoid that by cooking everything in one roasting tin starting with the spinach and mushroom stuffing [Music] let's do it with a salt and pepper please good girl some of your left shoulder left shoulder thank you in with the garlic and the mushrooms to toss the pan you push down and pull back down and push back off you go take your time push it down and flip very good that's it push down nice that was lovely and again nice i'm gonna drop let's see well done well done well then right we're gonna sort of make a little well a little touch of butter in the middle now we need to start putting the spinach in the middle piece so you can push that down the spinach is cold so you're not going to burn yourself be confident in the pan toss it and you'll see it wilting and disintegrating away wow who would have thought all that spinach could fit in this pan because it's a very delicate leaf it sort of cooks so quickly put this all on your board now and then i just want you to go and give that a nice chop then when you're confident with one hand we need to pick up the other knife the other hand chop it nicely good now outside and come in gently good regroup and take your time good mmm right i love that smell what is that lemon thyme lemon tan that's right so you get your little thyme stalks and you pour down you sort of strip lemon thyme in now tarragon it'll taste brilliant with the beef fantastic with chicken and fish roughly chop the tarragon and i sprinkle the fresh breadcrumbs so the breadcrumbs almost sort of bring the stuffing together next we're gonna get an egg yolk now with the beef this is the exciting part slice with the bone and then come inside and go two thirds of the way down hold that open for daddy salt and pepper and then look we pack our stuffing in there this is amazing it's incredible now just gently hold out there like that okay yeah i'll see you tomorrow what tying string around the rib will keep it all together during roasting not too tight if we tie it too tightly what happens the stuffing will come out that's right that's ready for roasting but we're gonna protect it and sit it on a trivet so a trivet basically is almost like a sort of little little bed a little bed that's right if you want to enjoy these delicious roast vegetables at their best make sure you remove them from the hot oven after 35 minutes and reheat before serving with your beef now a little mix for the top a couple of teaspoons of mustard powder in salt a couple of tablespoons of olive oil mix that in i'm gonna pour my mustard powder over the beef so this forms a really nice glaze my one pot roast dinner goes into a hot oven 15 minutes at 230 degrees then down to 170 degrees for another two hours for a delicious twist on traditional yorkshire puds i'm going to lace mine with fresh horseradish [Music] start with plain white flour in a bowl and crack in the eggs adding only half of your milk at this stage makes it much easier to whisk all the lumps out and if like me you like your puddings a little lighter and crispier add a dribble of cold water and add salt to season when you're happy your batter is lump free whisk in the remaining milk peel and grate horseradish and add a handful to the mix we can leave the batter to rest while we get the meat from the oven that is beautiful and this is where you really need to let it rest how long would you say to rest it for um i like to rest the meat for at least 20 minutes just the right amount of time for us to whack up the oven and to get our yorkshire puddings in i love using the rich dripping but vegetable all is a healthier option to get the fluffiest yorkshires your tray and fat must be piping hot for best results take your jug of batter to the oven and pour the mixture in there it takes just 15 minutes for our yorkshire puds to puff themselves up and turn a delicious golden brown with the yorkshire puddings on the way and the beef rested we can finish off the eater mess bomb run the bowl under the hot water twist and pull nice wow look at that beauty it's amazing sit that on to your plate now the finishing touches a drizzle of the remaining strawberry coulis i'm just going to pour this over amazing flavor and some grated mint chocolate and that is a nice twist on a classic eaten mess a delicious eat and mess bomb beautiful let's go baby please don't drop that meg please it's not a rounders match dessert sorted and the beef is ready to serve up lift that up place that onto the board parsnips parrots you can see why we kept them in halves they've got all that flavor one beautiful big slice for daddy one for maggie and then on the side it's stuffing the stuffing a bit that's the best to die for now fantastic yorkshire they're amazing aren't they beautiful mm-hmm that's for my daddy i met one that's for me beautiful roast beef with a twist wow [Music] these are my ultimate classics with a twist juicy river beef with horseradish spiked yorkshire puds and scrummy eaten mess bomb topped with strawberry coulis and mint chocolate crispy roasted with pancakes with the added kick of a black bean dipping sauce megan you're gonna help with the duck danny your favorite yes it is now how's your boyfriend right i'm going come on that woke you up didn't it so what do you love most about duck the dipping sauce the dipping sauce i love that let's get the duck in the oven first let's get a bit of salt in there please then some pepper thank you some spring onion garlic and ginger now why do you think we pour that in there season it and flavor it how come you put them in hole like that and not smaller it's going inside i'm not using it for sauce or anything so it's just going to make it really nice what are they star anita sorry so what happens as the duck roasts on the outside it creates this really nice perfume aroma inside tuck that in there to get it spicy rub all that chinese fire spice yeah over almost like you're massaging good so make sure you get it all in even the little wings you know underneath there just like i used to do to you in the bath i used to wash your little handys i know those days are long gone i know i know i know that is seriously spicy with the duck there's generally quite a lot of fat there yeah so we're gonna put it on this little bench okay and that goes there by slowly roasting it okay it's gonna get nice and crisp on the outside all that fat is gonna render inside the breast so therefore it's gonna get all nice and juicy yeah right ducks in three and a half hours at 160 degrees celsius your favorite part you said was the dipping sauce why is it your favorite part i think it really adds to the dark it makes it really tasty cena's is your favorite you can make it i'm gonna do nothing okay daddy's gonna put his feet up so uh first off the garlic there's one good girl watch your fingers please always do good nice oh you're fast huh watch your fingers i am watch your fingers slide slow down please 14. all right that's enough right little teaspoon of olive oil in a few years time i'll be teaching how to drive as well as cook how exciting is that you know in a car scary okay garlic in crispy duck is traditionally served with hoisin sauce but my brood love the additional big bold punch of black beans nice megan and i add soy sauce and lastly for that classic chinese sweet and sour element brown rice vinegar and honey are you happy with the flavour i'm really happy you can taste everything in there dipping sauce done duck's in the oven let's start the dessert the most amazing tata tan are those pink peppercorns they are pink peppercorns they're really good they don't taste anything like black peppercorns quite sweet aren't they they're really sweet very fruity the pink peppercorns give it the sweetness the black peppercorns give the heat now what is that baby vanilla this is one of the easiest desserts in the world to make but one of the most delicious it's a sort of take on the classic apple or pear to tan but when you caramelize those bananas with the peppercorns and the vanilla i bet that tastes amazing oh my goodness incredible okay i'm gonna make the caramel start off with the cold pen first and you just press that butter in there how come do you do it like that and not let it just melt naturally because i want the butter to stay cold because i'm gonna stick the bananas in there okay and then we'll make the caramel and caramelize the bananas at the same time so in goes those vanilla vanilla seeds pods in there as well okay peppercorns done yeah well done good girl sprinkle them over that butter just naturally naturally nice and then look just very carefully sprinkle sugar over that you're doing them all the same size roughly the same size wedge it into the butter well do you know what i want the bananas really caramelized you just stuck them between if you crown them in like this okay it will stop them moving around nothing's moving nothing is okay so all wedged in there sprinkle the peppercorns on top of the banana so you got that flavor in the caramel and on the top and the bottom right puff pastry puff pastry is difficult and time consuming to make so i always buy ready made when i'm at home to get the best flavor and texture go for the all butter type and keep your pastry cold before using it and this is where it gets really exciting you get your fingers you just pinch the ends so you thin the end if you do that for me very carefully have to be quick because the heat of your fingers can melt the pastry how comes you do it dad because we get it nice and thin so we can clip it underneath now take a spoon and what we do is lift up that banana and tuck it underneath see little like a parcel and see the thin bits of pastry yeah how easy it is to get it underneath yeah and that's why you thin them out you do it so quickly well because i have to be quick otherwise the pastry will melt notice how we're not using anything sharp so we're not would that cut the pastry that's right see how locked down that is [Music] gas on we'll start caramelizing her those three little holes are so important if we didn't put a hole in the pastry and it will cause a lot of steam so the pastry never cooks it just goes really soggy okay so really important the caramel is live now we're working the camel give a little shake how can you see the caramel through the pastry look what happens when it tilts oh yeah see all comes running down see yeah i see now that pastry okay it's like clinging on to the bananas and so when we turn it upside down we've got this glove full of these caramelized bananas look at that wow it looks like it look a locky look a locky ah look at likey got it now baby is your birthday soon 15. i've just worked it out on my 50th you're 18. perfect we should do a joint party yeah love it twelve two four for the old ones twelve lunchtime time till four for the old one so they can go to sleep megan will go on later come on perfect here's where i get excited now look at the color of that caramel so tilt the pan again see how dark it is now yeah wow it's gone a lot darker now didn't take long didn't take long at all that's nearly ready for the oven but before i put that in i'll get the duck out wow how's the duck doing crispy wow and delicious see how crispy that is it's really crispy that's what happens when it slow cooks so 20 minutes for the duck to rest and 20 minutes in the oven 190 to 200 degrees for our banana tartar tan time to knock up a quick hoisin and cucumber salad to put in our crispy duck pancakes for the dressing combine hoisin sauce rice wine vinegar soy sauce a dash of sesame oil and to give it that zingy asian punch some freshly grated root ginger [Music] for the salad trim and cut spring onions into very fine matchsticks peel a whole cucumber into long thin ribbons and shred in a couple of baby gem lettuces season and toss this fresh crunchy salad in the sweet yummy hoison dressing a combination that never fails to get the kids eating their greens wow look at that so see now where that pastry is caramelizing caramel so dark and just a little tip gas back on and that will release it because if you tip it

to spread and stops the sheets blowing around [Music] top your meringues with more finely chopped hazelnuts and bake for 25 minutes and the trick to stop them cracking is to turn the oven off and let them cool inside for the filling melt dark chocolate in a bowl over simmering water and slightly cool whip the cream until it forms soft peaks and gently fold in three quarters of the melted chocolate

morning the treat here is in that little baby honey so that sweetens it so just start off with 200 ml of delicious honey into a pan just to warm up in she goes now i know these are a chef's favorite but it makes all the difference especially for breakfast a fresh vanilla pod and i think of the way that i use herbs to add flavor to soups and salads i'd like to think the vanilla does exactly the same scrape out all those wonderful seeds in now the staple of the granola is the oats [Music] next puff rice delicious crunchy but light and fluffy next add wheat bran and your seeds pumpkin sunflower and linseed and then almonds incredible that nice heavy weight from the nut bunch now bring the honey to the boil slowly drizzle that amazing honey in give that a really good mix coat the granola with the hot honey just slowly churn it using the outside of the bowl you can see it just getting nice and sticky once the granola is completely coated in honey it's ready to bake now spread the mix on baking paper i'm gonna season it lightly with a touch of salt on top the salt throughout dries up the oats and the honey will roast color and glaze the granola nice into the oven for 25 to 30 minutes [Music] 10 minutes into the cooking simply run a spoon across the top to turn the mix and ensure it's crunchy all over you smell that light roast look at the color honestly look it's crispy it's delicious now i'm going to tart it up and put some lovely dried cranberries that just gives us chewy sweet flavor delicious and then finally these beautiful berries goji berries goji berries are high in antioxidants and have been eating china for centuries for their healing properties but you can add any dried fruit you like the cranberry and the goji berries gives it that nice chewy rich texture to the granola now this is the best way to store it it looks incredible really incredible look at that that eat well stay well right milk my homemade crunchy granola it looks good tastes good and it's packed with healthy grains superfood berries and seeds it's incredibly good for you too a breakfast for champions for my ultimate light lunch a beautiful quinoa salad with amazing textures and fresh aromatic flavors to excite the palette add one part pre-rinse quinoa to two parts cold water if you're not using pre-rinsed the quinoa grains should be soaked before use to remove their bitter coating bring to a simmer and cook for about 20 minutes until the water is absorbed spoon the cooked quinoa onto a plate and spread out to cool [Music] meanwhile dry roast flaked almonds in a frying pan once golden add raisins chopped mint and spring onions peel strips of skin from a whole cucumber to make stripes then remove the seeds and chop into half moon slices add half cherry tomatoes and the cooled quinoa and gently mix in with your fingers [Music] season with salt and pepper dress with a good squeeze of lime and drizzle of olive oil finish with a few fresh mint leaves spicy mexican soup it's hearty delicious robust but served with some tortillas and a wonderful salsa it's almost like a complete meal in one starting with some finely chopped red onions for my soup let's get some heat going early these are chipotle so they're smoky rich they don't come with any warning signal and these are seriously hot so be adventurous but beware a nice teaspoon of toasted cumin oregano dried now start frying off spices the heat you'll see the chilies start swelling up delicious garlic be quite generous on the oil because that helps to blow out the chili right now those onions and garlic are on fire we're going to balance the sort of heat from the chipotle with sugar turn up the heat and really start caramelizing that sugar and the chili gives off the most amazing aroma next fry up a tablespoon of tomato puree add a can of chopped tomatoes cook kidney beans and vegetable or chicken stock to cover there's something quite exciting about big and bold flavors because in the restaurants you have to be somewhat controlled you can't go crazy so cooking these kind of dishes at home gives me that kind of release chilis particularly when they're dried continue to swell and release their heat as they're cooked so the longer you cook your dish the hotter it will be [Music] but it's not as powerful it needs to be yet and every five six seven eight minutes that's gonna get stronger hotter and more delicious bring that up to the ball and cook that out for 15 minutes whilst i allow the chili heat to infuse i'm going to crack on with quick crunchy tortilla chips and a fabulously fresh and spicy tomato salsa known in mexico as pico de gallo start by finely dicing three ripe tomatoes one or two deceded fresh jalapeno peppers and half a red onion then chop a good handful of fresh coriander add the juice from two limes salt and pepper and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil for the tortilla chips rub a little olive oil onto six large shop bought wheat wraps sprinkle with smoked paprika and gently massage in cut each wrap into triangles and spread them onto a baking tray bake for three to four minutes in a preheated oven 180 degrees until golden brown and leave to cool to complete my mexican lunch i need to finish my deliciously fragrant spicy soup [Music] the spice is there it is absolutely spot on now for the cooling down process the mexicans are brilliant at building layer upon layer of flavor with delicious chilis and spices but they're also experts at tempering their dishes with cooling ingredients like avocado sour cream and cheese that's why you can take that amount of chili you've got a spoon of richness spice and all of a sudden avocados almost like a little fire blanket over those chillies to further counter the chilli heat mexicans use a rich tangy crumbly cheese but i'm sprinkling on lancashire which is a great british substitute and last but not least cooling fresh coriander one delicious spicy mexican soup serve that with your tortilla chips and your pico de gallo salsa a phenomenal blend of textures and layers and spice and creaminess big bold and delicious

versatile and once you've mastered how to cook them trust me the door then opens to a wide range of delicious options [Music] this is like a triple omelette but a lot more ingredients than a normal mess let's start off with some lovely smoked bacon slice the bacon bacon in no salt a little touch of pepper start off in a high heat get our bacon really nice and crispy otherwise you just boil the bacon and it's got that soft unpleasant texture in the potato turn down the gas and now start adding your veg roughly chop a red pepper and add it to the pan Els in the bacon take the longest so that's always got to go in first now sucker them off the peppers have been cooked now from that sort of rendered fat from the bacon and then you spring onions just Bunch them up slice them I want them on an angle so they come like little green diamonds spring onions in now for the eggs crack in the eggs for that size pan seven or eight eggs I'm gonna fill it right to the very top and more importantly when I turn this out I want it like a gateau nice and thick so slice through and seal those wonderful veg hmm I'm going to season the eggs with some Parmesan cheese be quite generous because it has a really nice saltiness [Music] fresh ground pepper and then whisk whisk up those eggs nicely [Music] then add peas to the pan and to give the dish a wonderful aromatic freshness some fragrant chopped basil I want to chop that sort of roughly because I want to see those flecks of green going in weren't looking charming and how many times have you seen a dull omelette potatoes in my mind really help encapsulate the magic of having Savory eggs cooked beautifully but with texture now just before we had the eggs we've got this beautiful little ghost cheese and it's strong and powerful so I want to slice it into little chunks and then just have it dotted around I want to discover these little pockets of creamy goat's cheese now slowly add the eggs [Music] fill that right up and get your spoon now just let all that egg go down to the bottom bring it back up to the boil and sort of clean around the sides and then some of this delicious salty creamy ghost cheese over the top yeah I want it melting like a perfect slice cheese on toast nice now from there turn the grill on for four to five minutes [Music] now just looking at that delicious take a little paring knife and just make sure it's released on the sides just take your panel ham that will hopefully release the frittata from the bottom of the pan now bought over the pan turn that gently and just Shake say a little prayer and lift off [Music] now from there on there it's there look now slice through you can see how soft and creamy that is in the center and that goat cheese are just melting almost like a little sauce inside so exciting but more importantly it's so easy to do it's got texture it's got creaminess and that for me will beat any omelette for brunch so with a stack of hot buttered toast and a steaming pot of coffee this easy potato Turns The Humble egg into the perfect dish for kicking off the weekend foreign should be a laid-back Affair and a treat so the dishes need to be easy to cook but never boring my next recipe takes the humble pancake to a whole new level of flavor and excitement soft fiery and irresistible spicy pancakes one of the secrets to good cooking is learning to use your imagination when it comes to brunches you don't have to stick to the old standbys these delicious spicy pancakes are a really great alternative but more importantly so easy to do start off by toasting your cumin dry roast basically non-stick pan just a touch of seasoning the salt helps to dry out the cumin even more and then fresh ginger slice them nice and thinly stack it back up and then just slice nice little thin slices in there and then keep that punched up shake the chili foreign the seeds will prevent things getting too hot now garlic nice now add olive oil to your toasted cumin seeds and then with the garlic ginger and chili lovely and it feels strange when you talk about garlic for breakfast but the time I spent in India everybody was eating something Savory for breakfast it was extraordinary into your bowl and set aside next the pancake filling add olive oil to a hot pan mustard seeds in now they'll start dancing the minute they hit the pan then finely slice an onion onions in a little teaspoon of turmeric sprinkle that in and I've got a color an instant change leftover potatoes just slice them smell is incredible take us in now spread the potatoes across the pan or the potatoes stained I want them sort of absorbing all that really nice turmeric actually like a sponge season those potatoes and it really helps to bring out spice beautifully Stay Ready turn off the gas and let them sit there and absorb all those flavors back to the pancake batter add plain flour to your cooled garlic chili Ginger and cumin seeds Touch of salt and pepper nothing worse than the Bland pancake one whole egg milk hold The Jug one hand and whisk the other secrets to get that really nice smooth paste but whisking that egg first and brings it together and then you're milking don't put all the milk in because then you're gonna get a lumpy pancake mix and if you put less milk in it really helps it not going Lumpy look at that milk here the secret for me is to have a nice thin mix well just teaspoon of oil that helps to bring a nice crispy Edge to the mixture now just taste that's the texture pan on the larger the pan the better it helps to create the nice thin even surface I want that mix going all the way around the pan before you put the mixture into the pan make sure you give your pancake mix a really nice stir pan it's nice and hot turn down the gas Touch of olive oil in get that nice whisk with one hand pan to the mix in one and a half ladles and then roll it around it's just really nice and thin I want to see the ginger the garlic that's what I'm looking for in there now back onto the heat it only starts to remove from the bottom of the pan and lifts itself up once it's cooked these little bubbles confirm that it's just starting to lift off the pan a little shake that releases it and then just shake it to the end and toss if you haven't got the content of tossing then use a spatula and turn it over now that's exactly what I want that nice sort of crisp edge around the side the color on the pancake is so important now roll it around just let it slide out beautifully now for the exciting part filling them take your potatoes just sort of have a really nice imaginary line and then just very carefully roll there nice and tightly tuck it underneath there put it back and roll pancakes are ready to eat but with a simple dipping sauce there'll be a real treat just mix chopped coriander with natural yogurt that's really nice cooling Asian sit down on the side for me is a great brunch delicious spicy pancakes amazing [Music] and one of my all-time favorites a dish that always creates a stir is the daddy of all brunches steak sandwiches [Music] for me the secret of a great brunch is fun and Casual fuss-free cooking and everyone helping themselves this is the ultimate steak sandwich you want the Rolls-Royce of beef it has to be fillet now season it beautifully I like to open up the top of the pepper mill to increase the size of the pepper in the steak so it gives that bit of heat nice little chunks you just roll now nicely all the way around slice the garlic in half pan nice and hot olive oil in hold the steak and just place it into the pan don't drop it at the front of the pan we're going to tilt the pan forward to cook the back of a stage dual purpose now roll it back and sear underneath next my garlic and roast that garlic time fry that time I want to hear it we're not looking for a lot of color because you're going to dry out the fillet so just one end turn it back down and stir the other ending foreign place it on top of the garlic there lift up your fillet and sit that on top of your garlic butter in take a spoon tilt the pan gently lift up and baste I've got that scented garlic thyme flavor the steak's gonna cook evenly because it's sat on a little a little bit in the oven for eight to ten minutes [Music] panel for the relish you think of a steak sandwich you think of a sort of nice heated tomato relish to make the relish finely dice a red onion three finger rule one in front two behind through and chop wow next roughly Chopper chili keeping the seeds in for extra heat start off with the olive oil into a pan onions chili [Music] generosity olive oil I want a nice sort of Rich silky relish from there bigger Tomatoes you can just use red tomatoes but these yellow and red make the perfect combination now put yourself in and then roast those Tomatoes off take a wooden spoon and just sort of break them up once the Skins blister the whole tomato just starts to release all that really nice sweet texture a little teaspoon of cherry vinegar gives that nice acidic balance the sweetness of the tomatoes turn down the gas and just let them sort of Stew perfectly now a steak sandwich will not be complete unless it had the most amazing mustard mayonnaise simply add three tablespoons of mayonnaise to 3 teaspoons of whole grain mustard [Music] I've got the radish almost down to like a really nice jam now I want to make that relish a little bit more fragrant some basil slice it through sprinkle that basil in there [Music] beautiful look at this there she is my crown jewels time to take it out smell is incredible just based one more time fill it touches quite soft in the center so it's just coming up to mid-rare let it rest the same time you cooked it it'll be nice and pink evenly throughout the steak to make my sandwich I'm going to char grill some sliced you Pata bread season it nicely just a little drizzle of olive oil I want to get that bread nice and crispy pan

Follow Gordon:...",2022-11-27 22:16:02.926159, slow cooking is one of the best weapons in the chef's arsenal not only is it easy it's also an incredible way to transform meat into mouth-wateringly melting dishes mastering the art of slow cooking is something every cook should learn first up my phenomenal slow cooked beef short ribs slow cooking is a brilliant way of getting lots of extra depth and intensity into your dishes the secret is to lock in all those flavors at the start and let the ingredients do their thing as it cooks these are beef short ribs and there's basically five to six bones across there and as the short rib cooks it sticks that bone the bone implants flavor and the meat just sort of melts cooks slowly gives it that nice level intensity slice alongside the bone straight down and see that marbling that sort of disappears and disintegrates i'm cooking them in a roasting tray get it on the heat until nice and hot season these short ribs beautifully olive oil in bone on the top we'll start colouring that in [Music] it's really important to give the beef short rib a really nice sear if you didn't brown the meat off it goes in the oven and it looks like boiled meat so you really want that nice dark rich coloring just cut the garlic in half slide that down the side that's going to give that beef an amazing flavor [Music] to give body to the sauce stir in a heap teaspoon of tomato puree just hitting the bottom of the pan with that tomato puree and we call it cooking out that smell of puree otherwise it just goes in there raw and it gives this sort of tartness to the braised short ribs red wine in don't use an expensive bottle of red wine there's no need bring the wine up to the boil and reduce it this burns off the alcohol and concentrates the flavor makes a big difference when you reduce the red wine down by half because it gives that nice dark rich intensity look at my garlic that is just gonna sweeten everything up incredible stock in beef stock perfect chicken stock fine just to about an inch underneath the beef short ribs bring it up to the ball to lock in all that flavor as the beef ribs slow cook cover them so they braised from the bottom and steamed from the top into the oven two and a half hours 170 to 180 degrees in she goes great thing about slow cooking is you do most of the work in advance and then put your feet up five or ten minutes before the beef short ribs come out of the oven start your garnish this is light cured pancetta i want nice thick lardons nice big thick sticks of crispy bacon [Music] these are delicious chestnut mushrooms i'm not gonna slice them just gonna cut them in half but look at the color on those lardons now all the whites raw fat have disappeared the lardons have shrunk right down and all we've got there now is the proper bacon mushrooms in beautiful so the mushrooms get seasoned from the bacon i'm pan frying these separately to the beef so they remain crisp and have a different texture [Music] leave that to cool down now this is like christmas day for me when you unwrap that fall wait you see what's underneath it [Music] wow they smell incredible lift and place on your tray beautiful to make a fantastic rich deep sauce press the soft roasted garlic through a sieve into the cooking juices i want all that nice pureed garlic coming through there because that is going to make the most amazing flavor scrape all of that off the sieve nice then just start sieving all that lovely brazing liquor wow in that smells delicious take your sauce and just glaze do them individually they deserve that respect spoon on your bacon and your mushrooms beautiful be generous with these mushrooms i'm telling you they taste amazing flat leaf parsley all that freshness over those amazing ribs incredible never ever be embarrassed about going to your butcher and asking for cheap cuts because the results are incredible amazing beef braised short ribs with bacon and mushrooms sweetcorn fritters and yogurt dip it's brilliant to have a number of great recipes up your sleeve to rely on and let's be honest we've all got a tin of sweetcorn somewhere so i'm going to show you how to make the most amazing fritter [Music] first off the mixture take your flour sieve really important to sift the flour that stops the mixture from having any lumps in there just before you get to the end i want to put half a teaspoon of baking powder the baking powder gives the mixture some lift in and just sieve that through a touch of salt and pepper next an egg about four tablespoons of milk and give that a little whisk now just put a little drizzle of olive oil in there that helps to relax the mixture whisk that in make sure we got rid of all those lumps so that i want a nice smooth almost like a cake mixture okay next take the seeds out of a chili to lower the heat roll the chili so give it a really good shake [Music] tap them out slice in half into quarter and each quarter in half and chop through it's a really nice quick way of slicing a chili into the mixture spring onion take off that outside layer of the spring onion top and tail slice it in an angle so i've got a bit of texture running through the mixture i want that nice crunch in coriander just slice through nice and gently and get that in there next to the sweetcorn now drain it from the tin and just pat it dry so it doesn't make the mixture too wet give that a nice mix you can see now i've got two thirds ingredients and one third of the mixture to bind together that's the secret of good frittata so you're you're biting into excitement not sort of dough pan on olive oil in nice and hot get a nice big dessert spoon you know there's one nice portion in space the fritters evenly around the pan in a clockwise direction so you always know which one to turn first just with the back of your spoon sort of spread them out a little bit okay palette knife just check you're happy with the color and turn over beautiful now for the chili yogurt dressing the seed and finely chop a red chili and add to a pot of natural yogurt and then some fresh lime [Music] finish with chopped coriander coriander in and give that a nice mix up that chili just lifts it the lime gives it that nice tanginess the fritters they smell amazing and with the sauce it tastes fantastic that is such a delicious recipe using a tin of sweet corn from your cupboard amazing [Music] whatever you're cooking the secret to making great food is to ensure you're locking every last ounce of flavour in that pan and this spicy sausage rice does exactly that [Music] take these spicy sausages and pierce that skin because i want all that delicious spicy sausage meat out of this casing and you get more flavor from the sausage when you take them out the casing sausage is ready turn on the gas bread onion less acidic than a big white spanish onion and a lot more flavoursome tablespoon of olive oil a tablespoon only because i want all that fat coming out the sausages to sort of really help flavor the onions onions in and the onions go in first because you can never rush cooking an onion it's really important to sort of give them five to six minutes in the pan so you can really start to caramelize them my mouth and my pepper slice around wasting nothing i want to see that sort of little core those pips in the center no fine diced pepper the rice is going to be cooking for 20 minutes so i want the veg to sort of have texture after it's cooked peppers in a bit of garlic two nice cloves just slap down off with the shell garlic in now i want to turn up the gas get the pan nice and hot because the minute that sausage goes in everything cools down and you'll end up boiling the peppers and the onions and the garlic so heat up to maximum and then just make a well in the center in now start stirring quickly this is where you get so much more bang for your buck out of sausages because the skins off and the real flavor of that spicy italian sausage is going to come through what's great about this recipe is that you can use any type of sausage to get the flavour and the heat you want i've gone for the spicy italian but it's just as good with merguez or sweet so a teaspoon paprika in give it that really nice smoky flavor rice in and we're gonna sort of basically sear the rice we call it in the kitchen blasting the rice where we sort of soaked the rice for 30 seconds and it takes on all that flavor next white wine so the wine sort of deglazes the pan and washes all that flavor from the bottom of the pan into the rice stock in bring it up to the boil turn it down and let it simmer [Music] double stop to rice turn that gas down and let it simmer for 12 to 15 minutes and just give it the occasional stir keep an eye on it now get ready to finish it slice spring onions diced sweet juicy tomatoes and roughly chop earthy flat leaf parsley spring is in tomatoes in off with the gas really important otherwise everything becomes overcooked flat leaf parsley in but look at the volume in that pan now that is an amazing way to take spicy italian sausages to a completely different level beautiful [Music] you

we're ready for it right diego how you feeling um shooting myself really are you ready to wear the diners yes i am yeah good one of you okay is going to come out as the f words best italian restaurant make sure it's you prosecco from bristol and salvos from leeds are our top two italian contenders here's how i found them the f word viewers love italian food you nominated hundreds of italian restaurants but we can only choose two to compete in the f-word kitchen determined to find the very best we went to visit your culinary heroes serving food just like mama used to make the search took us all over britain from nottingham to twickenham lesser to leeds coventry to clapham your fingers are so delicate oh yeah it's like you're playing the piano we discovered fantastic food and in some cases an exceptional level of service there's an ad for a handyman in the ladies lou i'm blocking out his number in case it's not what it seems after months of whittling down hundreds of nominations we finally found two outstanding contenders salvos and lee's shone out how are you i'm very good thank you very much welcome to salvos like many of the best local restaurants salvos is all about family john and jip are brothers their father salva started the restaurant in 1976 and 15 years ago they inherited the business really the restaurant's about feeling welcome feeling that urge to lean back in your seat to perhaps kick your shoes off feeling that you've arrived home and that's what we're about showing our passion for southern italian food and southern italian hospitality [Music] delicious every mouthful i'm tasting i'm trying to find something negative something's wrong with it that'd give a lot of italian chef to run for the money in london trust me if we actually got through it would be fabulous i'd be really proud they're clearly passionate family run which is nice authentic simple italian cuisine done with a great delivery of flavour so i've made my decision beautiful picture there who is that that's a mum and dad in selena on the lumbolare i think your pair is going to be incredibly proud for the next round [Music] well done guys i'm just so proud i just wish my dad was here to share this moment with us because he would have been just searching so salvos from leeds will be cooking the f-word kitchen tonight and i've found the perfect restaurant to take them on prosecco is a tiny place in bristol but it's already getting a big reputation it was opened three years ago by venetian chef diego del rey and is hugely popular with the locals yeah very well so this is where you're hiding down here yeah this is my bunker you see this is my my kingdom okay now you want it now you get it while diego works his magic in the kitchen his wife heidi holds down three jobs she's a teacher by day charms the front of house by night and also is a hands-on mum i think i'm married wonder woman honestly because i don't know how she does it she's absolutely incredible first up for me ravioli in a saffron sauce he personally makes these raviolis himself yes i'm keen to try diego's risotto a staple on every italian menu but a very hard dish to get just right not easy cooking out of the kitchen that small yeah it is it's always a challenge yeah sadly the saffron sauce was very strong i went out of my way just to do something special and yeah probably i cooked it up yeah with the sauce yeah the awkward thing for me uh right now is that this is a a very difficult category and sadly there's only two restaurants that are going through to cook at the f word restaurant for 50 diners okay and you're one of them congratulations congratulations thank you very much that was one of the best risottos i've ever tasted really oh great um absolutely delicious i mean i i mean seriously delicious thank you now you've got a real test for 50 diners and i've got every confidence in you you could pull it off okay yeah that's brilliant that's brilliant congratulations that's good diego too good looking to be a chef and uh yeah thank god i'm not having lunch with my wife today should go mad for him he really deserves it the whole idea of searching the country for these unsung heroes this is why that's spot-on accurate passionate italian cooking so i found my top two italian restaurants will the f-word diners prefer prosecco's elegance or salvo's rustic charm we're about to find out hey we're going to london now salvador yes shake hands with prosecco let's go let's go may the best brigade win yes christmas that's the end of being mating now we'll fight like a proper kitchen so that last dessert leaves that hot plate don't let me down more importantly don't let yourselves down or your restaurants down good luck right enough chat it's time for the starter we're back in london at the f-word restaurant tonight we're going italian from nearly 700 nominations we found the f word's best two local italian restaurants salvos and leeds and prosecco in bristol they're going to be serving 25 portions of their own starters if the f-word diners don't like it they won't pay okay on order towers yes two spinach ravioli two poor dessert two tart yes chef thank you yeah the uh prosecco two cup of really main course two venison followed by two tarts yes so they're underway and every single plate they send out is crucial half the diners will be trying salvo starter another half proseccos i've challenged them to cook ravioli an italian classic that's incredibly difficult to get right while the brigades are preparing their own versions here's how i do it fresh pasta the secret behind a great ravioli smooth silky and absolutely delicious try the filling olive oil butter garlic spinach salt pepper nutmeg [Applause] drain chop ricotta lemon zest toasted pine nuts parmesan chill pasta dough through the machine roll super thin cut on egg yolk fold push down and squeeze all that air out fold trim now to cook the raviolis literally one and a half minutes into the boiling water sage butter hot pan olive oil butter sage lemon juice take the revenues out gently roll it round the sage butter and look delicious delicate pillows parmesan beautiful spinach ricotta and pineapple ravioli with sage butter done now i diego jeff having been selected the best two selling questions in the country i know you can get every guest out there paying for your earliest okay make it count yeah ravioli is a simple dish but it's the one that really tests a chef because any flaws are immediately obvious both rations are cooking their own recipes it'll be interesting to see who comes out on top salvos and leeds has been making pasta for 33 years their southern italian food is rustic and charming cooking's not a chore cooking's a joy salvos are keeping it simple with the spinach and ricotta ravioli they're making a type of pasta called faziletti it's hand cut and folded like a handkerchief it'll be set with a simple tomato sauce which they'll be thickening with a knob of cold butter and uh recipe originated from where well it's a southern recipe so uh so it's rustic what are you finishing it with some fresh plum tomatoes sauteed in a little bit of water let me stop it you can work and talk at the same time i'm not a woman i can only do one thing at once no but i'll have a bash you don't sound that italian you got a nice broad yorkshire accent well i am fluent in italian what would you say to somebody if they thought that he wasn't italian hi here we go here's what i'm faced with i'm faced with a sort of pretty boy ravioli from milan and a rustic ravioli from leeds but they're both very impressive pretty boy first of all i'm from venice not milan [ __ ] grumpy italian scallions jesus are you always like this no this is nothing diego's northern italian roots means his food is elegant and sophisticated might appeal to you know to not everyone but people offset so i think we're on something pretty much right a fiery venetian is taking more of a risk with his ravioli diego is using a delicate filling of crab garlic and potato he's using saffron any sauce it's an unusual taste so diego's got to get it just right what does it mean to win tonight probably like winning the champions league you know that's that i think that would be the feeling really more than this brush is not good the brush this brush you see it leaves down this this bit of this bit of plastic you see it's meant to be black one no would you mean black one black hair brush you know this one would you keep our eyes open for you i'm not going to blame the brush yeah diego a black brush is not gonna make a difference yeah yeah it is make a difference because when you find when when when one of these hair is gone inside i won't be able to see it no instead of a black brush you're gonna see it because like one one of your hair there from seeing the [ __ ] kitchen you cooking in bristol don't dare start slagging off this kitchen here let's get that right yeah okay you're right for men that cooks have a [ __ ] cubby hole you know you don't have a kitchen here you have a pallet yeah no it is a palace man i don't expect guys like you to start complaining about a [ __ ] place make sure you flat out of this kitchen i want this to be the best service of your life all four of you yes yes yes four out of four in get full plates how long do you go for the rubbers 30 seconds they're going to change the sauce oh yeah just put them in the sauce okay so you got four more rolling yes yeah 14. i smell fantastic guys yeah really really good as you can see there's so much more to italian cuisine than pizza here's one of my all-time favorite ingredients this is chef alu on the beautiful island of sicily home to one of italy's most delicious ingredients it's octopus and for some bizarre reason we're actually terrified of eating it god knows why because it tastes absolutely amazing packed full of flavor and incredibly delicious beneath these crystal clear waters are hidden some of the best tasting octopus in the world [Music] grew up here and is going to show me how to catch them i'm obsessed with octopus we've had in the restaurant for the last 10 years from a capacio to a soup to the most amazing salad everybody loves here when we are at the table the octopus we go crazy right octopus can be tricky to catch so to maximize our chances we're laying pots just off the coast the more you lay the luckier you get so there's no there's no bait or anything no muscles no [ __ ] or nothing nothing at all the octopus use the pots for shelter i've heard they love shiny objects yeah you're gonna put that coin in there so i'm hoping a few quid will increase my chances good investment good investment that's another one it would be all full of october if not i'm going to dive and get my money back fingers crossed we left our pots to do their work but later that evening enzo decided to show me another method of catching the elusive sicilian octopus we should be sleeping right now yeah we should be about that we are not right fishing this is the way his father used to catch octopus in the dead of night when they come out to feed right what's the process now we're gonna look on the bottom of the sea and as soon as we see any movement of the octopus looking for food yeah then we're gonna spill it [Music] what color are we looking for there's some color over the rocks finally we found one but as i moved in for the kill the boat hit a rock i lost my footing and the octopus disappeared i was gutted i've got so close to it i could almost taste it my favorite sicilian octopus recipe would have to wait next morning following rough weather overnight and with more bad weather forecast i knew how to get out to my pots fast there's a lot bigger swell on the water today than yesterday so here we go yeah fingers crossed 15 or 16 octopus here's the first spot there's anything in there [ __ ] nothing nothing moving the coin not even the yes there is yeah coin is in there it's the second foot second part ah [ __ ] it wasn't just the first two that are empty oh come on now you understand why they are expensive to buy octopus we've pulled all 35 pots without one octopus to cook with absolutely sweet [ __ ] oh say they want to be coke to buy you plan b yeah i think i've got plan b enzo's mate had laid some pots a few days earlier and he swore they'd be brimming with octopus but before we could reach them our luck turned from bad to worse damn this is a disaster we're caught in a huge storm so we're gonna head back to port wait to the weather drops off but the storm didn't pass in fact the weather got even worse but it was three days before the clouds cleared and i could resume my octopus hunt they're saying in town that's one of the worst storms in 40 years with the sea finally calm our chances were the best they'd ever been how long have these pots been out here they've been here uh nearly a week they will be full of octopus first one this one nothing nothing it's been the story of our lives for the past five days ends are not today that's just the beginning okay oh my god jesus we'd caught it the traditional way so i was determined to kill it the traditional way too how do we kill them yeah you buy this head you what you're going to fight inside to kill it yeah right oh finally luck was on our side thank god for that we pulled in another two including a feisty two-pounder getting my hands on these little suckers has been a real battle but i got a mouth-watering sicilian stew recipe that i knew was going to make it all worthwhile five days for that baby ready to go now i'm gonna quickly blanch it in she goes lovely add seasoning and a splash of white wine to the pan and boil for 10 minutes time to get the octopus out beautiful the base of my octopus stew is fried chilies onions and garlic [Music] octopus take off the top slice that down then the octopus is going to start absorbing all that wonderful sweet flavor mixing tomatoes olives capers anchovies parsley fish stock and a splash of olive oil simmer 35 to 40 minutes i'm serving my stew to enzo's sicilian family a popular sicilian they're a tough mob and if they don't like it i might just wake up with a horse's head in my bed here we go [Music] i like you very very much very very good fantastic good tough five days however we made it it was worth it it was worth the test this is delicious katie price is tonight's recipe challenger so she doesn't get to vote but i got my team to prepare both starter recipes for her to try kd nice to meet donnie looking great enjoying your food lovely absolutely lovely you're trying to decide which one i prefer the first or the second yep i'm just have to pick which one would you prefer the crab one the crab with the saffron not too strong no lovely interesting good and favorite italian what would it be do you have a local in brighton uh donatellos always busy and now they've got so many different varieties of pasta and just different dishes is it the pasta the soups the taglitelli the ravioli i like taco telly carbonara with peas my extra peas mushrooms and more cream something you cook at home uh i've never tried it ready no no you're here for the rest of the challenge excited i am actually you could beat me well come on a silly question did you steal this recipe from mum when i was younger i also used to look forward to saturday nights watching murder she wrote blind date with my chicken care of sweet corn and chips chicken kiev sweet corn and chips fantastic really good to see you can't wait to see in the kitchen with a challenge excellent enjoy your dinner so last table chip yeah make sure that last table goes out chris like the first hair will you got the palms down there ready to go yeah maybe a few more scrapings italian cuisine that is best yeah one southern one northern i can't wait to hear the feedback from the customers yeah that means it's gonna be a close contest i'll tell you absolutely fantastic really good jeff chris well done adam diego well done i thought the uh spinach pasta was lovely the sauce was really lovely buttery but light i enjoyed it yeah i'll be paying for it it was quite nice all the ingredients and everything was very nice um i just thought the pasta was a bit undercooked how are the raviolis yes they're very nice they're very nice and that was salads yeah sort of talking straight right yeah kind of thing you could see um no no no something a little bit more refined not refined diego's would be a cleaner presentation are you going to pay for your starter i am going to pay for my starter glad to hear it good to see you thank you see you later thank you i thought the the flavor was fantastic overall it was a it was quite quite a tasty dish i felt it was slightly under seasoned it was lacking some taste in there for me personally no i won't be paying for the start today did you enjoy the starter yes it was fine i think what it did is it it just clarified the difference between northern italy in southern island southern italy it's all about letting the flavors talk to themselves northern italian a little bit dare i say a little bit fancy a little bit a little bit richer flavors and different style very very different now the most important question are you gonna pay for it no no wow are you gonna pay for yours i'm not gonna pay for mine hold on a minute you both liked it but you're not gonna pay for it it's just not of the i mean i'm being polite it's just not a good enough monitor enjoy your main course good to see you thank you my darling so one wife is paying for the opposition starter and the other isn't right i couldn't wait to try these and see what they're made of pasta's slightly bit thick there from salvos really good flavor sauce not too heavy in terms of flavor rustic and somewhat charming now proseccos we've got to try that pasta nice and thin pasta's cooked perfectly sauce vibrant got that wow factor the unfortunate thing is inside ravioli is slightly bland you could do a touch more seasoning what a shame i like both dishes but some diners have found a lot to criticize i really don't know what the result will be okay jb please right okay here we go thank you okay let's start off with salva the number of customers that are happy to pay for your starter tonight is 19 out of 25. well done congratulations thank you so um jb these six customers that didn't pay for their starter why um memories in the past i was too thick did you both roll the pasta uh i rolled it so it may i called perhaps i didn't get one or two lines yeah however 19 out of 25 well done okay prosecco for your starter out of 25 starters the amount willing to pay for your starter is 15 out of 25. hey rosetta what happened um the the crab meat was on the season so a slightly bland filling yeah i should have put more simple a bit of bit of salt and pepper would have just made uh made it better okay you still got your signature dish to cook and you can pull it back for the main okay okay head up okay salvos you're in the lead yeah long way to go now think of it this way you've got 50 portions of your main course to go yeah pull it back guys yeah good luck welcome back to the f-word now both restaurants are going to be cooking one of their favorite italian dishes for their wood diners first up is salvos [Music] check on one pork chop seven the recipe for salvos pork dish my ali al alchetto is one of chip's favorite dishes pork is my favorite meat and it is in fact it's the king of meads first he cuts three medallions and pounds them into scallops next he chops fresh mint crushes a garlic clove and adds white balsamic vinegar then stirs in grilled courgettes i can smell the garlic it's just releasing its flavor just with the heat of that and places in a hot oven to soften further chip blackens then peels these peppers then coats of scallops in flour and shallow fries i'm putting the peppers in and the kerpers he then adds parsley garlic thyme and vinegar then some sugar vital to balance the acidity now that the vinegar has done its work a little bit of white wine a bit of stuff which i've got here the [ __ ] finishes the sauce with a knob of butter [Music] here with my allied table five table five coming up with my alley porky scallops with sweet and sour peppers served why did you choose this dish it's got a lot of southern roots to it and uh are you putting color on the pork or you're just lightly searing it and no just put it a little colour a little colour on the port but it doesn't want to be too hard it's yeah it's a softer scallops yeah good there you go your venison dish you're using the loin cook so quickly uh yes now prosecco we're gonna have to pull out all the stops for the main course because they're four points behind but has he got a winning dish in that venison [Music] check on one venison special prosecco signature dish is a venison fillet with polenta and pancetta first diego says a venison it then flambes with gin diego then roast it in an oven for six to eight minutes next polenta in italian homes this is traditionally cooked slowly but in a busy kitchen diego uses a quick cooked polenta just as delicious but cooked in minutes not hours my grandmother would be horrified if i were using something like this it's like betrayal next diego fries onions carrots and celery then add crushed juniper berries which complement the gin beautifully they will give a nice gin kind of edge to your meat diego adds a bay leaf and some rosemary then pours on a glass of red wine letting it reduce before adding venison stock finally the pan fries pancetta adds blanched cabbage and crumbles in chestnuts you have salt peppermint there's a bit of sweetness and funny stuff with the chest [Music] venison fillet with polenta and pancetta [Music] served you running the venison through the oven or not yeah yeah i'll give it a pass in the oven yeah a bit of gin juniper flavor to the meat good why did you choose your venison dish why because you represent uh represents something from the mountain it's something everybody eats in my region you happy with that yeah come on do you talk to me yes indeed i'm just looking at each one four more by now yes well done yeah keep them all looking like that yes indeed sauce and everything thank you right now yeah you're ready there so we make it we make it very angle yeah good and you like the plenty runny oh yeah i like it you know i like it i like it too sauce with it yeah service please diego they look fantastic and it smells delicious thank you thank you thank you so much for okay it's not a watching not a race actually a race but it's important to win yeah very very close okay 19 to 15. what four in it your wife yeah heidi yeah agreed to pay yes for their dish yes yeah jim's wife that's the bonus didn't agree to pay for your dish now you can get it i wonder why yeah jim yes did you know that your wife and your brother refused to pay for diego starter i didn't know that no you didn't know that diego's wife yes paid for yours she thought yours was delicious ah yeah keep the energy the energy is there just you know let me use it for cooking yeah not for conversation just watching your plate i had the pork is really nice and tender and i really like the mash with the kind of crispy red peppers the courgettes were lovely with the mint and butter that was great but the overriding taste was on vinegar and i've elected not to pay for this dish i wouldn't pay for that there was a lot of flavors too many flavors for me all a little bit mixed up all a little bit too much the venison is beautiful and i really really like the i think it's chestnuts and the pancetta is really nice this blows the pork out the water to be honest it's a beautiful piece of meat it's very well seasoned and excellently cooked i'm not gonna pay for the venison on the basis that i didn't think it was cooked how it should have been cuts right the pork dish from salvos with crushed new potatoes port's cooked perfectly moist incredibly flavoursome nice little sear courgettes they managed to make a boring courgette into something quite tasty that is delicious however the sad news is the sauce is just a little bit too acidic a little bit too strong for the pork the venison dish simple presentation how's the venison cooked first off slice it in the middle yeah look at that perfectly cooked well that is harmony absolutely spot-on damn such a shame that's just a little bit too acidic now time to get the diners verdict all right well done seriously well done how do you feel uh excited looking forward to the results probably one of the most intense services i ever done all four of you yeah exceptionally well thank you chef and both dishes that phenomenal right let's find out how you did uh jb please yes okay salvo for your main course those that were happy to pay out of 50 34 out of 50. well done okay the 16 that didn't want to play where's the feedback the main reason is too many 34 out of 50. well done okay thank you right prosecco where's that hang on this one the amount of customers out of 50 that are happy to pay for your venison 40 out of 50. congratulations [Applause] what was the feedback on the 10 that i didn't want to pay what was it not enough sauce not enough sauce i'm not very keen on the pudental i mean how can you complain about hey totals so far salvo your restaurant scores 53 out of 75. prosecco your restaurant scores 55 out of 75. yeah you're now in front that is tight very very tight and it all comes down to desserts clear down get ready for the dessert well done guys really well done come on prosecco right janet's back and she's not just brewing one animal this time she's wearing the whole mixed grill last year janet became a farmer for the first time rearing two veal calves ah stop gumming me now i'm challenging her to raise all the meat for the serious finale in the f word restaurant in total should be raising over 30 animals it's going to be a huge challenge first up i've sent janet to juice some castle to provide me with some top-notch beef and dairy but not just any cattle i've selected dexter's a miniature irish breed which when fully grown are still only half the size of a normal cow penny hodgson is one of the uk's top dexter farmers and should we give janet help and advice on the breed shetland pony turns into a cow mike just find that you fall in love with them janet will be taking away two pint-sized milkers get off both come with calves the only thing when you're milking shortness dexters is the fact you have to bend quite a long way a good milking cow should have a healthy udder and a plattered nature ow ow naughty girl i'm so sorry [ __ ] thing just kicked me in the leg she is feeding two calves and she might just think that somebody else is sneaking in and trying to get a little bit of milk that was just a real one off she is i would say one of the most plastic girls in the whole herd here [Laughter] did you see that placid woman just headbutted another animal i like a bit of spirit so i'm going to choose her next i wanted to pick a couple of male dexter's called stairs for beef i've asked janet to choose dexter's with good frames long backs and the beginnings of fatty pads on their rums that will fill out and give superb dark richy marbled meat are you a bit of a golden yeti yes you are golden aren't you how many animals is that all together in you will have seven little dexters the seven cows are happily loaded up for their journey to the new home it's the eighth cow i'm worried about as far as i'm concerned i didn't sign up to get kicked and you know knocked about by them and i think there's too many of them but if anyone can keep this unruly bunch in check janet can i'm your new mum yeah [Music] look i'm in charge now so get over it good to see you my darling um you look great no it's always good to be nice to me early on starts off that way yeah and then it goes horribly well i've always been taught to respect my elders it's really good to see the pressure in the kitchen is bigger than ever yeah but you put me under so much pressure did you choose the decks just because they're so very very small just to wind me up no no they're very small you're a giant and they're going to know who's bust from day one well they did kick me it's true top notch meet for the grand final yes look after my little cows and don't scare them they won't be stressed out yeah you look great not a gray hair inside amazing right now the recipe challenge and tonight's challenger is katie price who promises to eat the most delicious horse meat sandwich if she loses oh oh my god that's disgusting now what are you cooking tonight well it's always been my favorite dish chicken kiev's sweet corn and chips but i thought i'd do it different i'm brilliant at mashed potato but with me it's not about presentation it's about slapping it all in and it tasting good so you choked in here so i'm gonna do my version right while we talk about it put my spuds on and in there i'm gonna put some sugar i always put sugar in don't ask me what i just think it seems to taste better sugar in the mashed potatoes yes i'm feeling more confident already good ah so garlic butter you'll be finished obviously with crushed garlic a little bit of fresh parsley and some tarragon and then a little touch of paprika just give it a little bit of heat god i'm not used to this question i normally buy already chopped don't even get anything out of it have to squeeze really hard can you manage and how important is food in your life do you think what does it mean oh i love food i absolutely love food who does all cooking at home who is that well i do some and obviously we've got nannies i'm not to lie because i'm very strict that the kids have fresh food i feel like i'm having any processed food and what kind of things would you be cooking on your own at home what would you what would you do if it's just me takeaways take your hurry uh-huh do you feel energetic after a curry no but i do like going to bed on a full stomach because you have the best sleep even though it's not good for you isn't it favorite aphrodisiac food what would it be i haven't got one nothing in fact people say the most if i'm sober i'm actually i shouldn't give these secrets away on the police show i'm better well performed in bed when i haven't had a drink more phil so that's kitchen at the moment now you're trying to put me off my cooking is that too much butter well that's

Today he's taking cauliflower, bringing some heat and making a delicious bang bang cauliflower recipe that can be done in under...",2022-11-27 22:16:02.926159, [Music] now as you know over 80 million of you understand that i love heat but what happens when you get the heat of the hot ones and mix it with some vegan ingredients a dish that goes bang that's right i want to show you a delicious vegan dish bang bang cauliflower now oscar zoom in please because we've got cauliflower broken down into what we call florets these little flowers with the stalk rice limes bok choy chili ginger dried chilies onions a little bit of cilantro or coriander depending where you are the secret of this dish is delicious and it's going to turn you vegan in nine minutes and 59 seconds let's have 10 minutes on the clock please right we'll shallow fry the cauliflower pan nice and clean hot pan for the bang bang sauce okay get that up to temperature don't put any oil in there yet i don't want to burn the oil okay a flower hold the cauliflower down lift your knife up and just go around the stalk and what happens look these little florets come off okay and they're like these beautiful little flowers and the stalks don't throw away great for soups now once you've got all these wonderful florets okay lightly season them don't worry if they break up a little bit but it's just so flavoursome and that's where the idea of this sort of dish comes from i started making this with chicken bang bang chicken bang bang pork but with cauliflower so tasty in here i've got some rice flour salt some pepper no chilli in there yet just a nice dust of salt and a nice dusting of pepper in there in go your florets okay and what we want to do now is just mix up those florets the rice flour gives it that really nice sort of coating and it helps get the cauliflower really nice and crispy okay so just dredge the cauliflower in there for a little bit okay now i'm gonna use sesame oil and olive oil okay and it's almost like a sort of it's gonna be like a shallow fry not deep fried there's a big difference sesame oil in and then some olive oil in okay and just bring that up to temp don't go crazy on the temperature if it becomes too hot move the pan over and just let it cool down okay now watch what happens when i drop these in we get this really nice crispy shell in okay bearing in mind every time you go into that pan you're bringing the temperature down so be careful okay use the heat accordingly now roll that around flood the pan with too much in there you turn the cauliflower really soggy okay so be smart now gauge the heat look at the color listen to the noise turn the heat up a little bit because the cauliflower has brought the temperature oil down now for that bang bang sauce okay i'm going to start off with some beautiful fresh ginger and onion you'll sweat that off first to slice the onion in half take off the root and then literally get some texture in that sauce down and slice in pans on we don't need to color the onion we need to sort of melt the onion okay so in olive oil in just a touch we want to melt this okay up with the gas and onion in from there want some freshness beautiful ginger give that a nice little saute pan down please oscar look what's happening to that beautiful rice flour starting to coat it's like this nice little blanket that gets crispy on the outside touch of salt in this bang bang sauce fresh ginger just slice it down i like it quite chunky because i wanna i wanna i wanna feel that flavor i want to sort of almost you know get excited about the freshness when you crunch that ginger you know in your teeth it sort of it lifts up your teeth and it's like the sort of the perfect cleanser because it makes your breath fresh and it is so fragrant fresh ginger in chopped almost like little battens ginger goes in now i'm going to start with the heat okay in goes the chili look at my cauliflower two pans rolling now this is the difference between shallow frying and deep frying okay i'm keeping the heat in the pan i'm keeping these little floats of cauliflower nice and sort of separate so they don't stick together but look at the color of them sauce is working beautifully what we're doing now is melting down that onion and that beautiful ginger from there this is where it starts to go up a level a little bit of a hot sauce in next a little touch of garlic don't go crazy in the garlic slice little blades in and flake that over i want the sort of sweetness but not caramelized once that hot sauce starts taking place after that a little bit of sweet chili sauce in there now look what's happened to that sauce and then my maple syrup and that starts to come together by this rich bang bang beautiful sauce now turn that gas off and let that sit there but get your lime roll that round and just hit that bang bang sauce with some fresh lime that's going to lift that together onions are melting the garlic is apparent and that ginger is giving it that nice fragrance now cauliflower look i've got the color on the cauliflower how do i make that just a little bit more vibrant i'm loving the color okay it needs something green so i just take a beautiful bok choy i've cleaned it under the water i go through the top once through the side once and then back to the top again scrunch it up and look all i'm doing now we call it like a little sort of chiffonade and it's just thin nice slices of bok choy and that gives it a little bit of freshness across that cauliflower stalks as well nice in open that up i'm going to drop that in to my cauliflower okay give that a nice toss now i love it quite hot you saw in the hot ones i can take a lot of heat now get your chili seeds in but i want this to be sort of almost like a raw chili because it goes in at the end okay chilli in and now look you can see while there's hardly any oil in there we've now got that collar on that cauliflower everything is so vibrant and then literally gas off sauce is set and i'm going to just finish this now with my lime and then look hit that that smells incredible look at the colour that comes out look you can see how that cauliflower is toasted and when i say toasted i mean it's sort of shallow fried but crispy that bok choy gives it the lift and the chili is thrown in literally second before it comes out and that bak choy [Music] brings it together before i serve i get my sauce i'm just going to literally drizzle that around i like to go on the outside so don't make all the center soggy and then finally coriander sliced once

Pre-order your copy of Ramsay in 10 here...",2022-11-27 22:16:02.926159, my take on classic chocolate brownies is guaranteed to put a smile on anyone's face and not just when they're fresh out of the oven blondies stock up in these delicious blondies they'll keep for up to a week and it's a great way of getting ahead of your expecting guests round first off melt the butter for the mixture we've had hundreds and hundreds of brownies the sort of white chocolate version i.e blondies are amazing a little bit more subtle keep a little knob of butter for the end just to grease your baking tray turn the gas down and gently melt that butter caster sugar into the bowl [Music] just give that butter a little whisk sort of makes the mixture a little bit lighter slightly fluffy off with the gas a pinch of salt in the sugar then make it a little wet in the middle and sort of whisk you can see it's already gone nice and blonde love it give that a really good mix and the secret with the butter be slightly warm sort of it melts the sugar nice and smooth lovely a teaspoon of vanilla extract in next lightly whisk in two whole eggs just give them a little beat this is such a delicious recipe yet so simple whisk in the eggs looking for that nice sort of rich textured smooth paste you can see why we call these blondies beautiful next teaspoon of baking powder baking powder in then half a teaspoon of baking soda that aerates the mixture and gives it that little tartness you'll see this sort of rise instantly the minute they hit the oven and then your flour whisk with one hand and just slowly add half the flour first get that all mixed up make sure that mixture is really nice and smooth check it occasionally no lumps half flour in and then the other half in you'll feel it sort of almost nice and firm and that's why it's so important to add the flour in stages it stops the mixture going lumpy it should be just dropping off the whisk beautiful change over from a whisk to a spoon next i want some texture some nice sweet chewiness to the blondies dried cranberries they bake beautifully but it gives the blondie a really nice sort of chewy sweetness in the center next a white chocolate [Music] i'm not going to grate it i'm going to chop it up just slice it like little bits of shrapnel i want the chocolate like little matchsticks dotted around now chocolate in lovely fold that in i want a nice even distribution of those wonderful dried cranberries don't over mix it i want to break up that chocolate nice even mix of cranberries and chocolate you can see the chocolate there'll be parts of the chocolate in the oven that will actually melt it'll be like little pools of white melted chocolate in the center now a baking tray small little knob of butter and the grease baking tray and line it some greaseproof paper and just over extend it shiny side out dull side hits the bottom of the tray in greaseproof allows me to maximize on the white chocolate inside the mix no greaseproof paper the chocolate can melt and almost stick to the tray so the paper is just a really nice insurance policy secondly we want that rise and that sort of crispness now with the mix get your spatula all the way around i don't want to see anything left in that bowl position the bowl over your tray nice and carefully loudly don't leave that slice in the bowl nobody's licking that one and then just take the back of the spatula go into the corners push and come back into the middle turn the tray around let it work to your advantage try and get it evenly positioned in the tray if it goes in even it cooks evenly make sure you smooth out the top of the blondie with the back of the spatula and then into the oven it's going to rise nice and crisp all that soft gooeyness in the center bake your blondies at 180 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes that smells incredible it's got that crisp edge on the outside and that sort of soft gooey center leave that to cool down and it's going to sort of firm up and wrinkle but it'll stay nice and gooey in the center once it's cooled down take it out and start slicing [Music] your mouthwatching blonde is a fantastic easy treat to have on hand for yourself or to share my next recipe is a time-honored british classic but with addition of spices it's given a new lease of life fragrant spiced rice pudding i love cooking with spices but you don't have to just cook savory dishes using aromatics and spices across desserts takes your puddings to a completely different level [Music] first off our spices this is a fresh vanilla pod fragrant and packed full of flavor use the back of the knife and flatten it that removes all those little seeds off the skin of the vanilla pod take your knife slice down the middle and then when you open that up the smell is incredible take the tip of the knife and you scrape inside and look all those seeds dying to come out that is incredible there are thousands of seeds still ingrained to the pod so put them in to the casserole cardamom powerful spicy take two little pods place your knife on top and lightly crack them cracking the cardamom pods helps release all the amazing flavour cloves gives it that kind of aniseed flavour with a lot of depth one two three cinnamon stick snap and in [Music] just smelling that level of fragrance you can imagine what the rice pudding's gonna taste off turn on the heat lightly toast those spices just a couple of seconds now what's gonna happen is just gonna sort of enhance those spices in a way that it just draws out an even more powerful fragrance coconut milk in sugar two tablespoons milk and then a couple of tablespoons of cream bring it slowly to the boil to allow the flavours to infuse and this rice pudding reminds me of my time in india where i got really into that chai tea fragrance because it was just so delicious and so comforting take a lime in the lime just cuts through the richness of the coconut gives it that nice little bit of acidity goes fantastically well with the cinnamon and that fresh vanilla nice have a taste now let's come up to the boil give it a nice little clean around the outside and in with the rice use 200 grams of pudding rice don't wash it beforehand because the starch helps thicken the rice pudding in the oven and just turn that down to a light simmer and the pudding rice starts to open up and it absorbs all that coconut vanilla cardamom clove and cinnamon bring up to the ball gently and cook it out three to five minutes boiling it rapidly the rice opens up and it goes into mush we want to keep that nice texture that sort of fragrant rice pudding on a gentle simmer next a little luxury i want to show you how i take this simple delicious aromatic rice pudding to a completely different level here's what i do take two egg yolks separate them now give that a really nice whisk two nice tablespoons of mascarpone cheese whisk that into the egg yolks just so it's nice and smooth it's almost like finishing the rice pudding in a delicious custard turn off the gas add that into the rice pudding what happens it starts to enrich and really thicken this rice pudding and takes it to a completely different level the rice is still not cooked it's starting to go nice and soft you can just see how it's opening up but looks like rich aromatic lava bubbling away finally great more citrus zest the lime on top roasted caramelized lime zest on top of rice pudding is phenomenal then put it in the oven for 15 minutes at 200 degrees to finish cooking the rice and develop the intensely aromatic flavours look at that an incredibly fragrant rice pudding how beautiful does that look spicy are a brilliant way of helping classic dishes come alive i'll guarantee you'll never ever have had a rice pudding like this before my next recipe is a proper british classic that's super simple to cook and cost next to nothing a delicious apple crumble crumbles are the perfect way to use fruit when it's in season there's lots of it about it's nice and cheap but most importantly the fruit's at its absolute best first off i'm gonna make a really nice light caramel pan on nice and low great two apples [Music] and this helps to almost sort of pure the apple so much quicker there's a lot of flavor in the skin so don't worry about peeling the fruit whether it's pears plums peaches flavors in the skin nice to start the caramel a couple of tablespoons of sugar the sugar helps to get rid of the tartness in the apple a touch of cinnamon that starts to make it a little spicy open up your vanilla just scrape out all those seeds now this just makes it light and fragrant all those seeds in to the sugar when making caramel be patient and always swirl the dish instead of stirring it when the sugar goes brown add the apple that starts to sort of cool down the caramel but it gives it a really nice sort of caramelised puree apple's almost disintegrating smells incredible turn the gas down slice up two apples it's a crumble that's got no frills straight forward no faffing around no peening of the skin i want them to sort of stand out from the caramel apples in now those nice thick chunks of apple sort of almost bedding itself into the puree dried cranberries gives it that nice sort of shock in the texture sweet and chewy i want it to sort of taste zesty spicy so sit the lemon zest on top of your apples and cranberry fresh lemon juice over and that just gives that extra acidic kick takes the cranberries the apples the caramel and the cinnamon to another level turn the gas off just let that sit let's concentrate on the crumble flour in a couple of tablespoons of demerara sugar sugar helps to get the topping nice and crispy butter in give that a nice little rub what we're looking for is like a a bread crumb mixture lightly season it with a touch of cinnamon and the demerara sugar sort of helps to get a nice fine crumble mix and it stops the butter from sort of melting in that flour so that's the basic crumble mix but i'm not finished yet muesli two-thirds crumble one-third muesli mix that in if you haven't got muesli then crunchy granola works brilliantly too lovely now start off in the center and work your way around i want the crispiness on the top the puree on the bottom of the caramel and then the texture in the center a good tip turn the gas back on i want it bubbling before it goes in the oven because then you just gotta cook the top so as soon as you see that caramel starting to bubble down the side in she goes let's go bake at 200 degrees celsius for 12 to 14 minutes until golden brown smells amazing [Music] beautiful still bubbling [Music] and look at it a delicious but very simple crumble with apples at the absolute best beautiful [Music] you

Pre-order...",2022-11-26 22:16:02.926159, now oxtail was something that we grew up with yeah there's something you can do in the morning and put it in the oven because it has to be cooked really really slow yes i'm gonna dust this in flour it's amazing how many chefs are using oxtail on their menus today it's incredible it's very popular it's very cheap as well it's amazing i used to make it stretch for like five or six dinners oh don't exactly it's not that bad now i know why we're all so skinny growing up it wasn't that bad i'm joking come on you know i'm joking but you see sometimes we went to the butchers and you had maybe extra two or three i used to put in a saucepan and you had lovely stock for soup what was that spicy soup the really nice tony and i used to make the good pot of scotch broth scotch broth i remember now i'll peel a couple of cloves of garlic i'll show you a quick word getting that out get your knife and just brush it peel them and i'll crush them in the garlic crusher okay all right all right oxtail in i'm gonna fry that off we can get that nice and brown and we've all braised it in red wine and sort of chicken stock before but i'm gonna get this done with a chinese influence the chinese absolutely love cooking oxtail you started cooking at home quite early on right 17 and a half 17 and a half your mum died quite young very young 26 26 so who taught you how to cook nobody taught you i think you just learn as you get older and you learn by your mistakes and did you enjoy it i did enjoy it yeah that was a nice vegetable the fennel panel isn't it that lovely it's beautiful yeah a lot of people don't use it a lot of them use it in salads but no one actually cooks it you just slice that up them now these are nice and brown and they look lovely put the color on there you just slice up the chili okay just slice it down and keep the seeds in there because i want some heat as well yeah i wouldn't have thought i'd put that in there no no one thing you never used to do was work with many spices there wasn't many chinese influences i wasn't very adventurous with spices like me no i like ginger do you i love ginger especially fresh yeah coriander seeds a little handful tim yeah some soy sauce and quite generous in soy sauce four or five tablespoons that helps give it that saltiness and a nice dark rich color on the vegetables so as it raises the meat tenderizes quicker i would never drink fennel and the chilis and that but it smells lovely does that smell nice and then a little bit of this this is a what's up a rice wine vinegar is it yeah what other tips would you give me in order to save money on cooking what got you through that tough time feeding all six of us and holding two jobs when that was in the oven sea for about an hour and a half then i would think right i'll make a roast pudding i put an apple pie and for the same sort of heat use the other shelf in the oven so you weren't just watching the pennies in terms of the produce you're also cutting down the gas bill yeah wow super nab yes yeah so oxtail back on top of the vegetables gonna top that up is that beef stock yeah this is uh no a really nice chicken stock why are you putting chicken stock in it because it's quite a sort of light fragrant way of cooking oxtail because oxtail itself is quite rich yeah chicken stock's nice and light just cover it with stock lovely colorism a beautiful color little taste there we go big deep breath okay then well that's lovely i can taste the fennel in that is that nice that's lovely oh jesus damn water for nan [Laughter] take some watermelon no water is it water come on while mum recovers from the kick off the chili to go with my oriental influenced oxtail i'm going to knock up a quick fresh radish salad take a bunch of radishes and separate off the edible leaves once washed thoroughly place half the radishes in the bowl with the leaves chop the remaining radishes in half and add them too [Music] next peel and finally slice a banana shallot add them to the radishes and season with salt and pepper dress with a good squeeze of fresh lemon juice and a drizzle of olive oil then mix radish salad it's that simple next up dessert delicious poached pears i love pears ready so we're gonna poach them with a little bit of chili chili i've never heard of that a little bit of saffron no no no pan on take off a little slice like that so they stand up nicely and then peel okay then and then the chilli you hold that up and just go down yep through and open that up okay into the water seeds in as well a little bit of chili water and sugar what are they holes saffron is expensive but you only need the tiniest little bit a little pinch to make that water go light and golden star in these how comes the chinese you've like sliced it at the end and it's not put in whole i want all that flavor coming out of the chili we're going to make the most amazing star in east dust sorry stars dust should you get your star nice in there seed up and then in see all those little seeds yeah and then you start grinding a little teaspoon of ginger give it a nice mix thank you meg and that's going to dust the top of the pears once they're cooked right get your pears drop them in there [Music] and that's what we're going to sprinkle mmm ginger and sternies the rice is that you're very good that's lovely isn't it so once they're cooked cool down sprinkle that over the top right have you guys got homework yes see you guys come back shortly thank you turn that down and let them fall okay bye thank you guys after an eight minute simmer our pears should be ready now just get your knife on put the knife through and see how easy the knife is so that means they're soft and cooked now you can leave them in that overnight two or three days all right and they just get darker and more beautiful the good thing about the cooking liquor is that you don't throw that away because you can use that again for re-poaching beautiful i mean they look impressive they smell delicious don't they [Music] look at the colors nice lovely isn't it because they're amazing and just smells delicious and then take your little star and east dust and just dust over look at that nice lovely now for my favorite part the oxtail wow look at that is beautiful hmm i'm just melts in your mouth doesn't it i love the way you see that just sliding down the bone there's no waste in that at would you all that to the table please then yes lovely and i will grab that that is beautiful [Music] this is my ultimate thrifty dinner sumptuous slow-cooked chinese braised oxtail with a light and peppery radish salad followed by gorgeous chilli poached pears with star and east dust whatever you're cooking the secret to making great food is to ensure you're locking every last ounce of flavour in that pan and this spicy sausage rice does exactly that [Music] take these spicy sausages and pierce that skin because i want all that delicious spicy sausage meat out of this casing and you get more flavor from the sausage when you take them out the casing sausage is ready turn on the gas bread onion less acidic than a big white spanish onion and a lot more flavoursome tablespoon of olive oil a tablespoon only because i want all that fat coming out the sausages to sort of really help flavor the onions onions in and the onions go in first because you can never rush cooking an onion it's really important to sort of give them five to six minutes in the pan so you can really start to caramelize them mouth and my pepper slice around wasting nothing i want to see that sort of little core those pips in the center no fine diced pepper the rice is going to be cooking for 20 minutes so i want the veg to sort of have texture after it's cooked peppers in a bit of garlic two nice cloves just slap down off with the shell in now i want to turn up the gas get the pan nice and hot because the minute that sausage goes in everything cools down and you'll end up boiling the peppers and the onions and the garlic so heat up to maximum and then just make a well in the center in now start stirring quickly this is where you get so much more bang for your buck out of sausages because the skin's off and the real flavor of that spicy italian sausage is going to come through what's great about this recipe is that you can use any type of sausage to get the flavor and the heat you want i've gone for the spicy italian but it's just as good with mergers or cheerso a teaspoon paprika in give it that really nice smoky flavor rice in and we're gonna sort of basically sear the rice we call it in the kitchen blasting the rice where we sort of saute the rice for 30 seconds and it takes on all that flavor next white wine so the wine sort of deglazes the pan and washes all that flavor from the bottom of the pan into the rice stock in bring it up to the boil turn it down and let it simmer [Music] double stop to rice turn that gas down and let it simmer for 12 to 15 minutes and just give it the occasional stir keep an eye on it now get ready to finish it slice spring onions diced sweet juicy tomatoes and roughly chop earthy flat leaf parsley spring onions in tomatoes in off with the gas really important otherwise everything becomes overcooked flat leaf parsley in but look at the volume in that pan now that is an amazing way to take spicy italian sausages to a completely different level beautiful [Music] slow cooked fiery lamb cooking's all about being bold and adventurous and this dish is exciting because it's slowly cooked and the longer it cooks the more flavoursome it becomes marinating the lamb first chilis we're gonna use a mixture of red and green take off the tops and just slice in garlic crushed don't worry about chopping these ultra fine just get it in there cooking for up to three hours everything sort of blends and almost sort of purees itself together smoked paprika goes brilliantly well with the chilis two teaspoons in a touch of dried oregano some little cumin seeds the blend and the fragrance that they give out is extraordinary they release a little oil as well and helps to tenderize the lamb a touch of salt pepper cinnamon that sort of sweetens up the lamb olive oil just a tablespoon and the olive oil helps to sort of stick all those wonderful spices to the lamb jump in just start really rubbing at this stage you can leave the lamb to marinade for anything from half an hour to overnight allowing the spices to really penetrate the meat giving amazing results when you tuck in delicious vegetables carrots and onions and that's it sliced secret slicing vegetables from braising is not getting too thin you slice the onions too thin they burn you've got that horrible char taste on that slow braised braising it's just a chef's term that means cooking in liquid on a low heat making the meat incredibly moist and beautifully tender so the secret of braising is having a really nice thick durable pan get that nice and hot just a touch of olive oil in hold the bone because you're in control then into the pan i want that white fat to start rendering so it'll add more fat therefore making it a lot more flavoursome as it braises chilies cinnamon in mix that up and don't be scared you're not burning this you're sort of searing the lamb shanks and this is the important part right at the very beginning we're getting the collar on the lamb which washes off as it braises in the oven so be generous with that color vegetables in wow and then a couple of baileys so now you lift the lamb up and get the lamb sat on top of the vegetables now just glaze the pan with red wine this glazing means that you're you're cleaning the bottom of the pan and you're getting that amazing flavor washed off and lifted up into that sauce can really transform that dish always delays then bring to the boil and cook for about 10 minutes to reduce the wines reduce down by half now for the stock bring that stock back up to the ball and then into the oven now don't cover it when you cover it all the condensation comes off the lid your lamb becomes gray all this effort and that exciting spice gets washed away no lid and in the oven for three hours a slow cook on a low heat of 160 degrees gives the spices time to work and transform the meat so it's mouthwateringly tender now look at those out on to a plate you can just see that meat sliding down juicy and incredibly tender grab it by the the shank roll around that rich delicious sauce look at that and get your sauce nice beautiful just get some mint don't chop it just pick that fresh mint and let it snow and there you go a very spicy delicious melting in the mouth lamb shank amazing you

#GordonRamsay #Cooking #Food...",2022-11-26 22:16:02.926159, it's breakfast and eggs guaranteed to spice up your day some of the best food i had in india was street food and every little food stall was cooking up something spicy something delicious a teaspoon of oil gonna toast off a teaspoon of cumin mustard seeds a touch of salt and pepper lightly fry them off it's really important to cook off the spices it intensifies the flavor but really draws out that nice spicy deep rich flavor so onion three fingers one in front two behind nice and fine onions in [Music] now we're going to caramelize those onions mustard seeds have started to infuse cumin has that nice kick now with a little touch of butter in there get it nice and sort of rich gas up nice and high and really caramelize those onions now once the onions have turned a rich golden color that's what i'm looking for that is beautiful add baby spinach keep that pan nice and hot if you don't cook it out the actual breakfast ends up watering when the spinach is cooked set aside and it's on to the spicy eggs now the breakfast really starts to come alight four nice eggs now give those eggs a little whisk a little touch of butter into the pan a little teaspoon of oil so the butter doesn't burn when the butter and oil are hot add a teaspoon of garam masala and turmeric cook that out now take your eggs into the pan almost gonna make like a really nice spicy scrambled egg turn the gas down now as the scrambled egg comes together just finish that with a little bit of butter i quite like the sort of creaminess makes it so much more delicious and then from there i get my spinach chop up and then fold in the spinach to your scrambled egg something quite exciting about eating spice for breakfast but it's served in these wonderful little thin naan breads this will work with any flatbread or wrap you fancy and then lightly toast your naan take the eggs off the heat whilst you get on with the last job add quick mint and spice yogurt dressing couple of tablespoons of fresh yogurt in there's always something take out the heat then add chopped mint salt and turmeric mix that in now take a scrambled egg and half fill and now it smells incredible get your yogurt down on top and lift that over and for me that's what really stands out with street food in india how delicious they can make street food with a little bit of spice amazing [Music] once you try this spicy wrap i promise you scrambled eggs will never taste the same a punchy breakfast of murgues and fontina stuffed croissants flavor there is incredible for lunch a spicy mexican soup be adventurous but beware serve with quick tortilla chips and a peek of the gaio dip meggy for dinner i'll be setting the world to right with my eldest megan you're so annoying i'm so annoyed when we make one of the favorite dishes crispy roast duck with pancakes and black bean dipping sauce cena's is your favorite that you can make it followed by a spiced banana tart to tan wow these are my ultimate recipes for a day bursting with a big and bold breakfast lunch and dinner starting with a breakfast that can't fail to wake you up murguez and fontina stop croissants okay big and bold i was living in france i stayed there for three years once twice a week i treated myself to the most amazing bold breakfast and it started off with these beauties here murgays cheap but incredibly tasty start off with a nice hot pan mug is in it's a very spicy sausage doesn't need any help doesn't even chili just a touch of salt and pepper you can smell the spice they started to release all that wonderful oil that flavor in there add a couple of cloves i'll finely slice garlic spread the garlic across the pan it instantly changes color takes on this nice dark rich golden color now take a look at the heat out with the parsley the stalks of soft herbs like parsley and coriander can be used to impart flavour during cooking but the leaves should always be added just before serving to give maximum colour and fragrance [Music] and then finish that off with my capers amazing all right beautiful now take your quest on they're literally 24 hours old so they're crispy on the outside and just slice off the lid this recipe is a great way to use up any leftover croissants from the day before i used to cringe when i saw the french cooks throw away croissants i used to cry thinking oh my god any idea what you're throwing away in terms of flavor whatever you do do not wipe out that pan dunk your croissants mopping up all that amazing flavor and caramelizing the inside for that beautiful and don't forget the lids and then get your thumbs and go inside the croissant all i want to do now is just create a little pocket and just manipulate the question now this is where it gets exciting mix up the capers the garlic and sausages look at the color of that wonderful delicious flavoured oil now some cheese but not just any cheese fontina cheese is like the number one cheese for grilling and because it's a very rich cheese you shave it thinner than you would a white truffle but it gives a really nice saltiness and a light smoky flavor a little touch of pepper salt place these big boys on the tray literally 30 seconds on the grill here we go nice crisp packed full of flavor now top them and that for me it's almost like being back in paris except this time i don't have to share them with the french my ultimate big and bold breakfast murgies and fontina stuffed croissants the perfect picnic breakfast my ultimate scotch eggs with a twist [Music] i go fishing a lot and scotch eggs are the perfect all-in-one mini picnic breakfast first thing get your eggs cooked bring the water up the boil onto the spoon and lower them into the water that way they don't hit the water and crack four and a half minutes that will keep the center nice and slightly runny now ground sausage meat i'm gonna make mine a little bit spicier i'm gonna crumble in black pudding that helps to season the scotch eggs inside a little touch of salt and pepper and then just to make it a little bit sweeter and a lot easier for the kids to eat some grated apple [Music] combine that blend in the apple and the black pudding eggs once they're cooked drain them and then run them under cold water cracking and cooling the eggs quickly will prevent the yolks turning gray tap them on the side of the pan put them back into the water and what happens the water seeps underneath the shell see the shell come off so much easier eggs still slightly soft in the center i want that little bit of richness with the yolk next you need to get yourself organized with a mini assembly line seasoned flour a little egg wash and bread crumbs take your mince golf ball size spread the pate manipulate with your thumb and then sit your egg in there and spread the sausage over the egg and you just seal that over it's really important to keep that nice even coating of sausage meat around the egg you don't want it too thick otherwise it gets too dense and it's unappetizing give them a light dusting in the seasoned flour if you don't put the flour on the egg wash won't stick if you don't put the egg wash on the breadcrumbs won't stick into the egg roll it round shake off any excess egg wash and roll it into your breadcrumbs you can use this same three-stage method to breadcrumb anything you'd like from chicken goujons and fish fillets to fina schnitzel these are panko breadcrumbs japanese white breadcrumb so no crust you can experiment by adding flavors to your breadcrumbs like parmesan herbs or citrus zest i always like to push the actual breadcrumbs into the sausage meat so it gets that really nice golden brown and stops any of the outside burning once bread crumbs lower the eggs carefully into a four centimeter deep bath of hot vegetable oil for 10 to 12 minutes the eggs are actually cooked soft and running the center so the objective is just to cook the sausage meat and the black pudding they look great don't they go and grenades there's something so magical about a scotch egg on a picnic because it's like this little mini breakfast beautiful drain them onto the paper roll them around just to get off any excess oil and then to transport them some greaseproof paper that for me is the perfect start to the fishing trip there's no wonder i never catch any fish because i'm always too busy eating my scotch eggs [Music] my ultimate black pudding lace scotch eggs an irresistibly delicious picnic breakfast

and a couple of teaspoons of hot water that starts to infuse the saffron and so you can maximize on the color across your flatbeds to make the dough simply add plain flour a pinch of salt and pepper to a bowl and then pour in a dash of olive oil that makes the dough nice and silky and rich your saffron water you'll see how concentrate it is now and you'll need cold water then simply need to bring the dough together mop up all your flour you can see now the saffron's activated it's got that really nice color beautiful use your wrist and just knead it nicely we'll do now is smoothing out the gluten strands push and tuck in push and tuck in and each every time you do this getting softer you just sort of form like this perfect beautiful dough it smells delicious that saffron is very powerful now sit that in your bowl cover it with clim film let it rest for 10 to 15 minutes this relaxes the dough making it easier to roll and gives it time to infuse with the saffron i'll cut that into three and then roll them nice and thinly now lightly flour the surface and then just bring that to like a perfect ball on the board once you've got that nice ball your rolling pin and just roll it out now it doesn't get any simpler than that and just lightly flour that on top a little salt cooking the flatbread is easy just pop in a hot dry pan and they're ready in minutes as it hits the pan it starts the blister she's ready for turning beautiful get that color on there now you want it nice and crisp almost blistering on both sides because it's nice and thin it's cooked once browned on both sides just cool on a rack flatbread's done now on to the muscles now the secret behind cooking great muscles is in the speed you cook the key is to chop and prep your ingredients before you start cooking first thing pancetta i want it quite chunky if you can't get pancetta i always like to use a sort of streaky bacon because i want to sort of render all that flavour at the streaky bacon now tomatoes garlic and chili cherry tomatoes they're just going in whole the garlic just crush the garlic so all that flavor comes out chilli i want some heat in here that's everything prepped now to get it cooked little touch of olive oil pancetta in pancetta takes moments once it's brown and crisp put your garlic chili and whole cherry tomatoes into the pan mussels go in okay and i'm using dry sherry i think it works better in this recipe than white wine which is classically used at this stage then oregano finely chopped stalks and all i'll go on and then just give that a little mix and we'll see those muscles start to open lid goes on you've got to lock in that flavour gotta lock in that heat the mussels will take four to five minutes to steam in the meantime cut your flatbreads into strips crispy and crunchy now the muscles wow that is incredible my goodness me [Music] now that is one lunch i definitely don't want to miss healthy and delicious doesn't get any better than that incredible steam muscles with saffron flatbreads made in minutes and packed with protein and vitamins this is one fast food meal that really is healthy [Music] the great thing about pastry is if you follow the basic rules the possibilities are endless whether it's simple short crust or flaky filo you just need a bit of practice to get it right my first recipe uses lovely buttery shortcuts pastry to make a dish that's as delicious as it is simple leaking pancetta quiche shortcuts pastry is one of the staples of the kitchen it is so versatile but the good news is it's one of the easiest pastries to make trust me when you crack it it can make a real difference to your cooking take a sieve when you think of short crust pastry it's sort of semi-flaky but it's rich buttery start by sipping 200 grams of plain flour into a mixing bowl large pinch of salt 200 grams of unsalted butter bring the butter up to room temperature if you let the butter become too soft then the flour so it doesn't absorb it in with your fingers rub together first now the secret is grab big handfuls and squeeze the butter into the flour so look what's happened literally in 30 seconds i've got that nice crumbly texture now a couple of tablespoons of water nothing worse when the pastry is so wet you can't bring it together it needs to shape like a nice rich cookie dough it's just a touch too dry so one more tablespoon of water [Music] and there you go it's coming nicely now that's what i want a nice sort of firm ball of pastry onto the board i'm going to use these one of the strongest parts of the body pull towards you and push back down use those wrists to really knead it together so just that nice sort of smooth texture now wrap it in cling film set that in the fridge for 20 minutes really important that you let the shortcuts pastry relax [Music] now to make the quiche you can use just an ordinary flan dish but i love making them in many frying pans which gives them an extra rustic charm brush with oil to stop the pastry from sticking once the pastry is at room temperature roll it out to a nice even thickness place it in the center of your little pan turn it in don't use your fingers because what we don't want is any holes in this just get a little bit of dough because that sort of acts like a little sort of mallet flattens it out nicely i'm building a sort of extra lip because that way i can get the filling at it's absolute maximum levels we're going to cook them blind first to blind bake simply means to pre-cook your pastry before adding the filling this ensures you'll have a fantastic crisp pastry add a sheet of foil or baking paper and weigh it down you can use rice pulses or ceramic baking stones just make sure you keep them for the next time in the oven 200 degrees for 10 minutes now for the filling i'm gonna do a classic quiche bacon and leeks this is a amazing cured pancetta pancetta is an italian cured meat made from belly pork seasoning with things like juniper nutmeg fennel a great substitute is unsmoked bacon as the pancetta gets lovely and crispy finely slice leeks and add leeks and bacon nice really important to cook those leeks down that's exactly what i want those leaks are almost sort of caramelized slightly crispy the flavor's amazing and just drain them off so any excess fat gets drained a couple of tablespoons of cream it gives it a really nice richness i want two-thirds garnish i.e bacon and leeks in my quiche and one-third of the savory custard a touch of salt a touch of pepper i'm gonna grate some gruyere cheese that makes a really nice sort of creamy less of an eggy quiche take my amazing crispy pancetta and leeks in give that a good mix needs one more little thing some freshness flat leaf parsley incredible really important just to taste the mixture with the quiche filling ready next finish off the pastry [Music] remove the fall and weight and return to the oven to get it lovely and golden all over [Music] now when we fill them give that a really good mix up [Music] beautiful grate over some more cheese which will bubble up and melt beautifully and then into the oven bake your quiche for 15 to 20 minutes [Music] incredible it's got that nice sort of cheese and toast smell from the top it's sort of baked but the secret of any good quiche is in the short crust because that's the hero we're creating bbq style beef brisket with crunchy coleslaw and sweet potato wedges which will be right up her street holly now you love barbecues right so gonna help me barbecue this delicious piece of

chicken stock or even vegetable stock once the stock has come to the boil cover tightly with foil you just pinch in the ends flat that down and then you just twist all the way so that's nice and tight that's the hard work done thank you simply pop it in the oven for three and a half hours and as it cooks you can get on with the side dishes first job sweet potato wedges with some serious flavor

hollandaise over a rolling boil with a glass bowl butter just put it on to melt three egg yolks separated from the white tarragon vinegar pop that into the eggs if you can't get tarragon vinegar any white wine vinegar will do just as long as you've got that acidity in there give some bite to the hollandaise put your bowl over the rolling water and just start whisking if the eggs had diet contact with the gas hollandaise will become scrambled egg once you've got that nice creamy texture a nice thick savvy on start adding your butter nice and slowly a couple of tablespoons of butter in and give that a really nice mix if you don't whisk it enough the egg yolks don't take the butter it causes it to split with more butter using a big balloon whisk like this one makes it easier to incorporate air and helps prevent your mixture from separating all the butter in and the best way to keep hollandaise nice and warm is just leave it to sit over that nice warm water bath and it just keeps at a really nice room temperature a nice pinch of salt fresh pepper and then fresh lemon juice that just really makes it vibrant exciting i want it's like a sort of thick custard i just want it to coat the back of the spoon so it's like you're giving the a nice glossy texture to your beautiful poached egg now as the base for the egg benedict you cannot beat english muffins but the ham i'm gonna change i'm gonna use the most amazing parma ham get your pan nice and hot into the pan it's like posh rashes are bacon beautiful [Music] parlor ham fried nice and crisp like that is incredible beautiful in salads fantastic for eggs benedict [Music] now keep that pan nice and hot i want all that flavor from the parmesan left in there and rather than toast my muffins i want to put the muffins into the pan i want them sucking up all that wonderful flavor from that crispy parmesan make sure your muffins are toasted nicely this will prevent them going soggy later look at that nice and crisp now water on to boil for the eggs nicely seasoned really important i mean just a little splash of vinegar in the water that helps to set the egg white the minute you crack it in while the water heats up in the pan there's time to get organized lay a nice slice of ham on the base now water's brought up to the ball turn it down and then spin your water around like a little whirlpool then get a little cup so you just drop the cup in and look what happens to the egg gets caught up in the turbulence of the water the secret is not to ball the water rapidly because the strength of the ball can literally explode your egg as they start to move the way up to the top of the water that's a indication that they're cooked take off any excess little bits of egg white and then out onto a piece of tissue paper that just drains off excess water that stops your muffin from getting really soggy but look they're like little beautiful mozzarella balls give them a little season lift them on to your crispy parmesan useful now get a nice spoon of your hollandaise glaze over try and do it in one glazing over the whole egg [Applause] when i tell jack holly and megan and matilda that we're cooking eggs benedict for breakfast they bolt down the stairs and let's be honest who wouldn't run to sit in front of those [Music] a special occasion breakfast that would make anyone feel spoiled eggs benedict with crispy parmesan [Music] aren't they small yeah it's tiny so it's almost like a sort of nice entrance into eating something slightly gamey okay if you give them a nice season for me salt and pepper and all spatchcock means is that the rib cage has been taken out and they're flattened down and because the bird is so delicate it's flattened to cook evenly and it really is a nice sort of light gamey dense chicken flavor so we're toaster spices when you think of middle eastern food it's packed with amazing flavors tablespoon of coriander a teaspoon of cumin and a nice little seasoning of salt so we toast them now intensifying the flavor when they start smoking lightly that's a nice indication that they're ready okay if you grind away so the best thing there let's just stand a little closer today thank you oh look your tummy's out i thought it was the quail it was a little tummy this hand here keeps it nice and firm and you grind that into a nice powder for belly please smells so good doesn't it yeah so to get that in really go around the outside and that grinds it up i've gone around i press the mortar more times than you kissed boys squeeze the garlic in next a little glove a volleyball okay then i want you to pour six tablespoons please so that is pomegranate molasses so it's like an aged balsamic vinegar but really reduced down give that a nice mix up is it going to be very sweet dad a little taste it's sweet but sour yeah it is it's so good though no take a nice spoon put it inside the quail you can even do this the night before because if you pop them in the fridge let the quail marinate anywhere from half an hour to overnight for my ultimate middle eastern dessert it's got to be baklava start by melting butter in a pan chop pistachios in a blender [Music] then combine with caster sugar and lemon zest [Music] brush the melted butter around a small baking tray place half a sheet of filler pastry on the base brush well with melted butter and sprinkle with a pistachio mix repeat and press down between layers you're looking to create 30 to 35 layers [Music] then cut the baklava into bite-size rectangles and bake in a preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes meanwhile make your delicious citrusy syrup simply add water to a pan along with caster sugar and the zest and juice of a lemon simmer for seven to ten minutes making sure the sugar has fully dissolved now to give the cloud a wonderful sweetness remove from the oven and whilst hot pour over the syrup so each layer is gloriously sticky leave the balcava to absorb the syrup for at least 12 hours these delicious sticky treats will keep for a week but they're so moorish they'll be gone in a flash the quails have marinated now they're ready to cook nice hot pan pick up your quail and skin side down first okay get all that nice color and always open them up as well in the pan okay we'll get that skin crisp crispy that's right smell that pomegranate i can really smell it smells so good get all that marinade in there you know cook with it as well don't waste it how long on average does it take to cook could you say literally 12-15 minutes in the oven a little touch of water in [Music] bring that up to the ball into the oven 180 so 12 to 15 minutes [Applause] okay the final job before serving a herby butter bean salad to go with my quail in pomegranate molasses now one of the things that i love about middle eastern salads is the sort of crunch and the color as well butter beans it's gonna be the base of our salad from their little radishes and sort of top and tail them get them like that and throw them in there's nothing small and dainty in there okay so with the spring onions nice we're gonna use the greens and the whites i'm gonna slice along that way this time it's got those nice light shards okay yeah now the croutons are made out of these little pita breads just slice lengthways in with a salad oh yes so this salad is all about texture so cucumber okay and take out your seeds how come you're taking the seeds out it just makes the salad very watery it's like a shower okay cucumber juice delicious i think there should go yeah you got me going you really got me going no no no oh yeah i've got revision to be doing don't worry this is far more important trust me who needs exams where you can cook for a living you gave me with my exams it's fine it's fine it's fine be a chef for a living have a proper job don't take your things out like that you'll be thumbless let's go now your cucumber in from there take your nice vibrant tomatoes slice down it almost looks like a greek salad as well colors it resembles that that's right and with the celery like before yeah lengthwise so we need some mint and parsley i want you sprinkling it in there really mix it through the herbs give it that nice kind of freshness but i want a bit of a bite in there now i love pomegranate so just carefully open that up okay and then just dot them on top so we got a bit of fruitiness now into the salad for crunch simply cut up whole pita breads fry in a really hot pan with olive oil until wonderfully golden crispy and irresistible out into a sieve okay next a sprinkle of sumac that's a dried fruit from middle east the zest of a lemon and the juice then a drizzle of olive oil and last but not least my crunchy pitter croutons croutons on oh they've gotten hard oh just lift that up and mix in with your hands there nice and juicy just with fingertips there you go so you just mix there you go it doesn't crush anything it doesn't crush anything but then let's just take a little

Pre-order your copy...",2022-11-26 22:16:02.926159, now how's your boyfriend right i'm going come on that woke you up didn't it so what do you love most about duck the dipping sauce the dipping sauce i love that let's get the duck in the set a bit of salt in there please then some pepper thank you some spring onion garlic and ginger now why do you think we put that in there to season it and flavor it how come do you put them in hole like that not smaller it's going inside i'm not using it for sauce or anything so it's just going to make it really nice what are they star anise sorry so what happens as the duck roasts on the outside it creates this really nice perfume aroma inside tuck that in there to get it spicy rub all that chinese fire spice yeah over almost like you're massaging good so make sure you get it all in even the little wings you know underneath there just like i used to do to you in the bath i used to wash your little handys i know those days are long gone i know i know i know i should die that is seriously spicy with the duck there's generally quite a lot of fat there yeah so we can put it on this little bench okay and that goes there by slowly roasting it okay it's gonna get nice and crisp on the outside all that fat is gonna render inside the breast so therefore it's gonna get all nice and juicy yeah right ducks in three and a half hours at 160 degrees celsius your favorite part you said was the dipping sauce why is it your favorite part i think it really adds to the dark it makes it really tasty cena's is your favorite you can make it i'm gonna do nothing okay daddy's gonna put his feet up so uh first off the garlic there's one good girl watch your fingers please always do good nice oh you're fast huh watch your fingers i am watch your fingers slide slow down please 14. all right that's enough right a little teaspoon of olive oil in a few years time i'll be teaching you how to drive as well as cook how exciting is that unite in a car scary okay garlic in crispy duck is traditionally served with hoisin sauce but my brood love the additional big bold punch of black beans nice megan and i add soy sauce and lastly for that classic chinese sweet and sour element brown rice vinegar and honey [Music] are you happy with the flavour i'm really happy you can taste everything in there dipping sauce done ducks in the oven let's start the dessert the most amazing tata tan are those pink peppercorns they are pink peppercorns they're really good they don't taste anything like black peppercorns quite sweet aren't they they're really sweet very fruity the pink peppercorns give it the sweetness the black peppercorns give the heat now what is that baby vanilla this is one of the easiest desserts in the world to make but one of the most delicious it's a sort of take on the classic apple or pear to tan but when you caramelize those bananas with the peppercorns and the vanilla i bet that tastes amazing oh my goodness incredible okay i'm gonna make the caramel start off with the coal pen first and you just press that butter in there how come do you do it like that and not let it just melt naturally because i want the butter to stay cold because i'm gonna stick the bananas in there okay and then we'll make the caramel and caramelize the bananas at the same time so in goes those vanilla vanilla seeds pods in there as well okay peppercorns done yeah well done good girl sprinkle them over that butter just naturally naturally nice and then look just very carefully sprinkle sugar over that you're doing them all the same size roughly the same size wedge it into the butter well do you know what want the bananas really caramelised you just them between if you crown them in like this okay it will stop them moving around nothing's moving nothing is okay so all wedged in there spreading the peppercorns on top of the bananas so you've got that flavor in the caramel and on the top and the bottom right puff pastry puff pastry is difficult and time-consuming to make so i always buy ready-made when i'm at home to get the best flavor and texture go for the all-butter type and keep your pastry cold before using it this is where it gets really exciting you get your fingers you just pinch the end so you thin the end if you do that for me very carefully you have to be quick because the heat of your fingers can melt the pastry how comes you do it because we get it nice and thin so we can clip it underneath now take a spoon and what we do is lift up that banana and tuck it underneath let's see lift up a little parcel like a parcel and see the thin bits of pastry yeah how easy it is to get it underneath yeah and that's why you thin them out you do it so quickly well because i have to be quick otherwise the pastry will melt notice how we're not using anything sharp so we're not would that cut the pastry that's right see how locked down that is [Music] gas on we'll start caramelizing that those three little holes are so important if we didn't put a hole in the pastry and it will cause a lot of steam so the pastry never cooks it just goes really soggy okay so really important the caramel is live now we're working the camel give a little shake how can you see the caramel through the pastry look what happens when it tilts oh yeah see all comes running down see yeah i see now that pastry okay it's like clinging on to the bananas and so when we turn it upside down we've got this glove full of these caramelised bananas look at that wow it looks like look a locky a locky ah look at likey got you now baby you're sorry i'm sorry it's your birthday soon 15. i just worked out i'm my 50th you're 18. perfect we should do a joint party yeah i love it 12 2 4 for the old ones 12 lunchtime time till four for the old one so they can go to sleep megan will go on later come on perfect here's why i get excited now look at the color of that caramel so tilt the pan again see how dark it is now yeah wow it's gone a lot darker now it didn't take long didn't take long at all that's nearly ready for the oven but before i put that in i'll get the duck out wow how's the duck doing crispy wow and delicious how crispy that is it's really crispy that's what happens when it slow cooks so 20 minutes for the duck to rest and 20 minutes in the oven 190 to 200 degrees for our banana tartar tan time to knock up a quick hoisin and cucumber salad to put in our crispy duck pancakes for the dressing combine hoisin sauce rice wine vinegar soy sauce a dash of sesame oil and to give it that zingy asian punch some freshly grated root ginger [Music] for the salad trim and cut spring onions into very fine matchsticks peel a whole cucumber into long thin ribbons and shred in a couple of baby gem lettuces season and toss this fresh crunchy salad in the sweet yummy hoisin dressing a combination that never fails to get the kids eating their greens wow look at that so see now where that pastry is caramelising caramel so dark and just a little tip gas back on and that will release it because if you tip it and it's still sticking then some of your bananas will stick yeah so now see when it starts spinning around like that moving around and here we are the moment of truth when you know your daddy is the best chef in the world ready yep wow the vanilla how delicious is really good as well right start to stand out done crispy dipping sauce cucumber salad ready so if you take them and your dipping sauce take them over thank you i'll take the duck don't drop it promise oh okay yeah it was amazing my ultimate big and bold dinner of crispy roast duck with pancakes with a hoisin dress salad and some extra oomph from megan's favorite black bean dipping sauce caramelised figs with ricotta slow cooking can also take desserts to a whole new level a gentle long cook can really bring out that wonderful rich sticky sweetness and that depth of flavor in fruits these are black figs they are suited to slow cooking roasting better than the green fix because this outside skin is so durable this is an amazing way of roasting figs and it's so easy yet so delicious lay your figs out in rows take some rosemary and just peel that down get that really nice fragrant stem get your scissors trim the edge almost we've got a bit of a sort of sharp point bring your three figs together and just thread the top of each fig nice and gently rosemary works wonderfully with sweet dishes as the figs roast in the oven the stalk will impart a lovely subtle flavor useful dust the figs with icing sugar then coat them with a generous splash of basil with vinegar leave them to sit there for five minutes this sort of marinade i know it sounds odd to use vinegar in your dessert but trust me it gives the dish a fantastic sweet and sour taste i'm gonna make a really nice caramel four or five tablespoons of sugar now flatten that out and get it nice and even when the sugar is even caramel cooks evenly it's changing now you can see it melting from the outside in the one thing you don't do is shake the pan rapidly and see it almost like sort of a lake defrosting and it's hitting to the center bubbling still not dark enough yet it's getting there turn the gas down and stay in control let the sugar melt until it turns a dark amber color the secret behind any good caramel is just stopping it from overcooking lovely take that off the gas knob of butter in there just gently whisk in the butter it's cooling the caramel down you'll see it changing color to like a cafe lay next add a log of the balsamic vinegar nice beautiful got that nice dark richness of the caramel a little touch of water in there that way the caramel doesn't go too thick now put the caramel back on the heat take your figs and sort of place them in gently lovely and then just add all that lovely little marinade [Music] don't waste that it's amazing stuff there [Music] icing sugar embossed on the vinegar there's something so tasty baste those figs because the skin gets nice and crispy on the outside and the fig sort of just absorbs the caramel delicious so easy now into the oven 190 for 10 minutes [Music] almost doubled in size now look at the color on them the smell is incredible onto your plate they're a lot heavier because they've actually started absorbing that caramel now douse the figs with caramel and serve with ricotta cheese the freshness of that ricotta goes brilliantly well with the figs i'm gonna finish that now with some zest and then some little nibbed almonds and the rich creamy jam texture of the fig with the ricotta is brilliant that is an amazing way of slow roasting fruit and taking figs to a completely new level [Music] pan on for the stuffing it's a saddle of lamb basically a sort of rolls-royce cut perfectly shaped and it suits stuffing to an absolute tea for the stuffing finely chop an onion garlic nice thin slices oil in onions and garlic in [Music] salt and pepper make sure the stuffing is beautifully seasoned so it helps to season the inside of the lamb now we've got the color on those onions we're gonna throw in some pine nuts and that helps to give a bit of a texture here's where it starts getting really exciting spinach in and just lay the spinach over the pine nuts it looks like a lot of spinach that's going to condense and disappear almost instantly there's so much more flavor in spinach when you saute it as opposed to steaming it or boiling it gas off look at that now to bring that together no eggs no breadcrumbs crumpled feta over the spinach feta cheese adds a beautifully salty sharp and creamy flavor what this does it brings our stuffing together now open up the lamb keep those little fillets to the side that's the channel that we want to stuff so i want to just open that up a little bit there salt and pepper lightly and before we put our stuffing in we're going to season it with soulmate sumac is a wonderful lemony spice that goes brilliantly with lamb and you can get it in most big supermarkets and it sort of cuts through that thick rich sweetness of the lamb open up that lamb there take a spoon if you're preparing this for the day ahead then let the stuffing cool down it's inevitable when you start rolling it and tying it something's gonna squeeze out so load up the ends take these beauties these little fillets and just support that stuffing and sort of increase that beautiful tunnel and then from there over there and bring that towards you and then roll like i said some of the stuff is going to come out now just tie it first off around the side and don't worry about some flash butcher's knot just tie it one in the middle you can get butcher string from your local butcher or at cookware shops i got two ties go to tight it just forces all that stuffing out of the lamb when it's in the oven nice now we'll just season the top of it roll the joint to make sure all the skin gets seasoned now you think normally that just goes in the oven like that that's how my mum would do it but get your tray onto the gas oil in get it very nicely coloured none of your stuffing is coming out the sides really important look at that color beautiful does kick start the roasting process gas off into the oven cook for 45 to 55 minutes depending on how pink you want your lamb lift the lamb out of the fat to rest resting it raised up in the tin will stop it cooking but not cool it down too quickly and means you won't lose any of those lovely juices next i'm making a simple but sophisticated accompaniment for the lamb top and tail the cucumber peel it cut the cucumber into three and just core taking out all that it's just sort of watery seedy and it spoils the flavor slice cucumber cucumber in really nice way of making a cheap and cheerful cucumber look glamorous we're gonna dress that cucumber with a nice fresh yogurt a couple of tablespoons next some fresh mint dressing a touch of salt a touch of pepper and then pomegranate molasses that just sweetens it up finish that with lemon mix that up lamb is rested carefully take off the string and then just gently pull them back a serrated edge knife that's going to cut through that crispy fat on the outside instantly i tied it purposely so i can get my portion control from the lines hold it nice and firmly look at your line where the string was and look this one is going to be amazing lay and down just in those two slices there it proves that stuffing meats is for special occasions because that is a saddle of lamb at its absolute best stuffing meats and fish not only makes them look fantastic it also gives them an extra added flavor dimension too once you've mastered the technique you'll be able to turn out dishes that will guarantee you'll have an unforgettable feast so if you want wrap the chocolate start breaking up in little bits we're going to make the most amazing white chocolate mousse our first job is to bring half of our cream up to the boil so what kind of cream is that in there dad that is double cream okay so that's gonna make a really nice rich chocolate mousse what's your favorite sort of chocolate is it white milk dark um i love white and milk what's yours i absolutely love milk chocolate oh that's my guilty pleasure is it really here we go cream in so that goes in there now you can see what's happening straight away can't you it's melting really quickly melting really quickly so okay oh excuse me at least your jumper's white so you won't spot it yeah i've got a nice little snack for later in another bowl add lime zest cold cream and whisk until it forms soft peaks the lime cuts the sort of richness of the cream and that starts to make the chocolate mousse taste a little bit lighter mmm it smells really good the lime gives it a really nice zingyness xenos you're absolutely right next add to the melted chocolate mixture because i'm whisking it's just getting lighter and lighter and lighter have a little taste nice yeah the lime gives it a really nice taste telly i need the rest for the mousse i need them for my tummy no come on chocolate moves into the fridge our next job is to separate out three egg whites this is where i need you at your absolute best okay because to whip those whites it's gonna be really tough so we'll take it in turns 30 seconds each okay you go first 10 seconds gone come on tilly 15 seconds gone 20 seconds gone come on you can do it 10 seconds to go five four three two one and change exit hold the ball right no no way [Music] 30 seconds this puny little thing and you come with a big little machine gun that's the best way of whipping up egg whites start tipping that sugar in slowly don't look very happy in there our contentious whipped egg whites will make our mousse light and airy and when they've reached soft peaks we can gently mix in our cool white chocolate and cream mixture once the egg whites hit the cream yeah the chocolate sets the egg whites keep the cream nice and fluffy and you get this nice light mousse in the bowl now i need you to crush some raspberries please with some fresh you can see all mint juice coming out now take your mousse wow that looks really cool now look at that down the bottom there little crushed raspberry delicious now i'm going to set that in the fridge if you miss a count over the door please our yummy white chocolate mousse will take at least two hours to set so we can crack on with our mediterranean-inspired vegetarian starter griddle courgette ricotta and mint bruschetta for this recipe you'll need a griddle pan an essential piece of kit for that char grilled look cut thick slices of chapatta bread drizzle both sides with olive oil season with a little salt and pepper and griddle each side until toasted then slice a couple of courgettes diagonally into half a centimetre thick pieces drizzle and coat in olive oil and season with salt and pepper sear on a smoking hot griddle pan in batches until all the cagets are bar marked on both sides next roughly chop mint leaves and combine with creamy ricotta cheese spread your toasty topata with dollops of minty ricotta and top with your seared courgette super simple and super tasty now we're going to make a delicious beetroot risotto we need to get the shallots just slice them in half and then just chop them like that okay okay now have you ever made a risotto no i haven't actually shallots please into the pan for daddy add a sprinkle of salt and pepper along with a couple of crushed cloves of garlic once you start cooking the risotto it's really important to have your stock gently boiling away if we're adding cold stock on top of the rice all the time it just slows down the process generally you cook a nice wide flat pan if you cook in a deep pan all the rice sort of cooks at different temperatures what stock is that in there dad because that's a vegetable stock yeah because you can't have different stocks if it's more vegetarian can you i made that mistake once putting beef stock in the vegetarian soup no i didn't matilda are you sure i'm positive i'm joking fry off time how nice does that smell it smells delicious rice in that's a bit of a different rice this is elboria rice it's a perfect rice for risotto now it's really important to sear the rice if we were just to put the stocking without sweating off the rice it goes all starchy so keep on stirring for daddy it's just gonna make a fun day no flambe on the risotto to go with our deep red beetroot theme i'm adding red wine followed by the first ladle of stock to get things started now we're off wow it's giving it a cloudy sort of look what's happening to the stock the stock is reducing down and the rice is sucking it in that's right so the rice is actually getting nice and plump whenever risotto is live when it's like this now we can't stop cooking there we have to kill it all the way okay ready for the next ladle i'm ready good girl here we go ladle in so we have to make this for literally 20 25 minutes and we're nursing it all the way beetroots peel them rub them a little bit of salt and sugar yeah and a little bit of aged balsamic vinegar in there roasted them i'm a great my parmesan how's that rice doing the rice is doing good now that is exactly where we want to be now look look at that nice glossy textured rice so beetroot i want you to put two thirds of the beetroot in there for me saving one-third for the top good sprinkle the parmesan in there for me please all over nice it's like it's snowing again and then we're just gonna get some nice butter in there the butter gives the risotto a really nice gloss look at that beautiful let that come down let it come down first all right get your spoon in there now for daddy beautifully there you go good wonderful shake it risotto should be like lava it just flows out and then the rest of the beetroot on top and then finish some extra virgin olive oil on top

dishes mastering the art of slow cooking is something every cook should learn first up my phenomenal slow cooked beef short ribs slow cooking is a brilliant way of getting lots of extra depth and intensity into your dishes the secret is to lock in all those flavors at the start and let the ingredients do their thing as it cooks these are beef short ribs and there's basically five to six bones across there and as the short rib cooks it sticks to that bone the bone implants flavor and the meat just sort of melts cooks slowly gives it that nice level intensity slice alongside the bone straight down you can see that marbling that sort of disappears and disintegrates i'm cooking them in a roasting tray get it on the heat until nice and hot season these short ribs beautifully olive oil in bone on the top we'll start coloring that in [Music] it's really important to give the beef short rib a really nice sear if you didn't brown the meat off it goes in the oven and it looks like boiled meat so you really want that nice dark rich coloring just cut the garlic in half slide that down the side that's going to give that beef an amazing flavor [Music] to give body to the sauce stir in a heaped teaspoon of tomato just hitting the bottom of the pan with that tomato puree and we call it cooking out that smell of puree otherwise it just goes in there raw and it gives this sort of tartness to the braised short ribs red wine in don't use an expensive bottle of red wine there's no need bring the wine up to the boil and reduce it this burns off the alcohol and concentrates the flavor it makes a big difference when you reduce the red wine down by half because it gives that nice dark rich intensity look at my garlic that is just gonna sweeten everything up incredible stock in beef stock perfect chicken stock fine just to about an inch underneath the beef short ribs bring it up to the ball to lock in all that flavor as the beef ribs slow cook cover them so they braise from the bottom and steam from the top into the oven two and a half hours 170 to 180 degrees in she goes great thing about slow cooking is you do most of the work in advance and then put your feet up five or ten minutes before the beef short ribs come out of the oven start your garnish it's a light cured pancetta we want nice thick lardons nice big thick sticks of crispy bacon [Music] these are delicious chestnut mushrooms i'm not going to slice them i'm just going to cut them in half but look at the colour on those lardons now all the whites raw fat have disappeared the lardons have shrunk right down and all we've got there now is the proper bacon mushrooms in beautiful so the mushrooms get seasoned from the bacon i'm pan frying these separately to the beef so they remain crisp another different texture [Music] leave that to cool down now this is like christmas day for me when you unwrap that fall wait you see what's underneath it [Music] wow they smell incredible lift and place on your tray beautiful to make a fantastic rich deep sauce press the soft roasted garlic through a sieve into the cooking juices all that nice pureed garlic coming through there because that is going to make the most amazing flavor scrape all of that off the sieve nice then just start sieving all that lovely brazing liquor wow in that smells delicious take your sauce and just glaze do them individually they deserve that respect spoon on your bacon and your mushrooms beautiful be generous with these mushrooms i'm telling you they taste amazing flat leaf parsley all that freshness over those amazing ribs incredible never ever be embarrassed about going to your butcher and asking for cheap cuts because the results are incredible amazing beef braised short ribs with bacon and mushrooms it's wise to save leftover wine for cooking my tip is to freeze the remaining wine in freezer bags or ice cube trays it's great in stocks and sauces when you need to chill wine fast simply add a large handful of salt to your ice bucket the salt reduces the freezing point of the water which will chill your wine in six minutes flat a delicious saffron flatbread with mussels it doesn't get any healthier than that first job the super easy saffron flatbread put the saffron into the bowl and a couple of teaspoons of hot water that starts to infuse the saffron and so you can maximize on the color across your flatbeds to make the dough simply add plain flour a pinch of salt and pepper to a bowl and then pour in a dash of olive oil that makes the dough nice and silky and rich your saffron water you'll see how concentrated it is now and you'll need cold water then simply need to bring the dough together mop up all your flour you can see now the saffron's activated it's got that really nice color beautiful use your wrist and just knead it nicely we'll do now is smoothing out the gluten strands push and tuck in push and tuck in and each every time you do this getting softer you just sort of form like this perfect beautiful dough it smells delicious that saffron is very powerful now sit that in your bowl cover it with cling film let it rest for 10 to 15 minutes this relaxes the dough making it easier to roll and gives it time to infuse with the saffron i'm going to cut that into three and then roll them nice and thinly now lightly flour the surface and then just bring that to like a perfect ball on the board once you've got that nice ball your rolling pin and just roll it out now it doesn't get any simpler than that and just lightly flour that on top a little salt cooking the flatbread is easy just pop in a hot dry pan and they're ready in minutes as it hits the pan it starts the blister she's ready for turning beautiful get the color on there now you want it nice and crisp almost blistering on both sides because it's nice and thin it's cooked once browned on both sides just cool on a rack flatbread's done now on to the mussels now the secret behind cooking great muscles is in the speed you cook the key is to chop and prep your ingredients before you start cooking first thing pancetta i want it quite chunky if you can't get pancetta i always like to use a sort of streaky bacon because i want to sort of render all that flavor at the streaky bacon now tomatoes garlic and chili cherry tomatoes they're just going in whole the garlic just crush the garlic so all that flavor comes out chilli i want some heat in here that's everything prepped now to get it cooked little touch of olive oil pancetta in pancetta takes moments once it's brown and crisp put your garlic chili and whole cherry tomatoes into the pan mussels go in okay and i'm using dry sherry i think it works better in this recipe than white wine which is classically used at this stage then oregano finely chopped stalks and all i'll go on and then just give that a little mix and we'll see those muscles start to open lid goes on you've got to lock in that flavor gotta lock in that heat the muscles will take four to five minutes to steam in the meantime cut your flatbreads into strips crispy and crunchy now the mussels wow that is incredible my goodness me [Music] now that

Pre-order your...",2022-11-25 22:16:02.926159, keeping it simple in the kitchen doesn't mean you can't have amazing food that not only looks incredible but tastes fantastic too my first recipe is so easy it removes the stress from cooking and is a pleasure to make chili beef lettuce wraps cooking should never be a chore the more you cook the more confident you become that way you actually start to enjoy it and that's the key to good cooking have a bit of fun along the way this is minced beef and minced pork the pork needs to sit in there otherwise the beef's gonna dry out it's really important to season the mince before you cook it pan nice and hot touch of olive oil mince in breaking up like that really helps to sort of separate it so we can fry it off with a lot of color with your spoon just go through and start breaking that up the most important thing to remember is mint is made up of cheap cuts brisket belly short rib so it needs help and frying off the mince for color it's so important if this pan wasn't hot your mince is going to boil there's a horrible gray color on there and there's no flavor on your mince taste a little bit [Music] tastes delicious it's seasoned beautifully see how crispy it's going take it much further than you ever taken mints before nice and crispy smells incredible draining it it's crucial it keeps the mints nice and crispy and you get rid of that excess fat that's lovely now just wipe out the pan then wash it low gas now we're going to add texture to the mince finely chopped chili ginger garlic and spring onions spring onions give this sort of mince a really nice freshness because it just gives that crunch nice and thinly now i'm gonna fry off the chilies the ginger the garlic first sesame seed oil teaspoon only in garlic chili ginger in fry that off nicely the sesame seed oil just lifts up the whole flavour brown sugar that starts to really caramelize the chili the garlic and the ginger mince in now my fish sauce that gives it the saltiness you can see now why it's so important to get that mince really crispy because nothing's going soggy staying really crispy fresh lime that makes the mince fragrant and then lime juice roll it and squeeze that in there [Music] incredible i've got the salty i've got the heat i've got the sweetness now i've got the acidicness as well and then finally my spring onions in right at the last minute so i've got crunch in there as well smells amazing literally cook the mince now with sort of 30 seconds to go gas off and take it out looks incredible smells so inviting [Music] to go with the chili beef i'm making a simple sweet and spicy dipping sauce so everyone can dress the crispy mince to their own taste dipping sauce little teaspoon the brown sugar soy sauce gives it a nice sort of dark rich color sesame seed oil a tablespoon and just top that up with a tablespoon of olive oil that stops the sesame seed all becoming too rich a teaspoon of fish sauce and then a touch of chili leave the seeds in again i want the heat in that sauce so impressive an amazing show off center piece lime juice in in the coriander chop it through once give that little mix up just check the seasoning that's lovely nice and rich now the lettuce i'm going to use baby gem because it's really nice and durable and sort of quite strong so you just sort of sit these nice trimmed lettuce leaves around now the exciting part serve take your lettuce up spoon in your mince and then a little touch of dressing just a little drizzle nice and that's the secret of having good easy relaxed food is that you just help yourself food that looks and tastes a million bucks doesn't have to be complex this dish is as fun to cook as it is to eat [Music] mushroom and leek pasta this fantastic fast and simple pasta dish made with everyday ingredients just goes to prove you can eat good food whenever you want really important put the water on first so you can just have it gently simmering away ready for the pasta while the water comes to the boil start the sauce by slicing mushrooms first off fingers one in front two behind up and down add olive oil to a hot frying pan [Music] i want that nice color on the mushrooms off the heat literally 10 seconds and when you toss something really important you get all the ingredients at the end of the pan push down and pull back that noise that's that's all the water coming out of the mushrooms next finely chop a fat clove of garlic then prepare your leeks just take your knife and go down through the center turn it over and again into quarters see all that opening up and then just rinse the top of that to get rid of any potential dirt or sand it just breaks up into nice little quarters add all that leek into those mushrooms beautiful and now the secret is to get rid of that water inside the leek as it cooks down all the water's gone you just left that really nice intense flavor garlic's got nice and crispy now we're gonna add a touch of chicken stock in there beautiful lasagna sheets just gonna drop the sheets in to the water lasagna sheets are an unusual choice for a dish like this but they work brilliantly although any type of pasta you've got in the cupboard will do and just twist that pan that stops any pasta actually sticking to the bottom of the pan chicken start to reduce down by half and it's almost delayed the bottom of the pan basically washed all that wonderful flavor off turn the gas down and add a couple of tablespoons of cream this just enriches the dish bring it back up to the bowl and let it simmer for three to four minutes now the secret with the pasta is just taking it out a little early so you've got that nice texture hold up the sheet and just nip it and you can feel your fingers in the center it's ready turn the sauce down and lay these beautiful sheets of lasagna into that sauce i'm just going to turn the gas off now and let the pasta sit in there and absorb that amazing sauce finish with chopped fresh tarragon it's a delicious herb it goes brilliantly well mushrooms and leeks just let that sit and almost sort of infuse to serve i'm making a quick bruschetta by toasting fresh chipata bread two nice slices drizzle that in olive oil a little bit of garlic just rub the bread the crust as well crust is what really takes that garlic now pan for the bread little touch of olive oil as it starts to smoke bread in [Music] but look at the pasta now it's been stained by that amazing sauce to serve i want a nice spoon of my mushrooms leeks and cream then i'll take my pasta just twist it and let it sit on top that tarragon has just lifted everything bread on and that's the beauty about something so simple that can be done in 20 minutes with everyday ingredients a stunning pasta dish adding easy and versatile dishes like this to your repertoire is what cooking at home is all about so you can always make great tasting food at the drop of a hat i flavor packed lamb with fried bread whether i'm cooking high-end dishes or rustic dishes trust me it all has to be impressive so this lamb dish proves that you don't have to spend a fortune to create delicious food first off put the pan on this is a lamb steak and it's cut just above the leg just here because you can see that delicious bone running through the center and that's full of marrow so that just gives the lamb a nice added sweet flavor just take your knife cut through each end this stops the lamb steak from buckling so therefore it cooks evenly and colors beautifully salt and pepper lamb needs quite a lot of help with the pepper so be quite generous with the pepper and just pat that down the pan is just under smoke on the outside now put the oil in get that pan really nice and hot because this is a cheap cut so i'm depending on the color of the lamb steak to really sort of impart a lot of flavor that's the noise you want to hear if you can't hear that noise don't drop the steak in put a little bit of garlic in there not chopped garlic just whole cloves the garlic lightly crushed don't even waste time peeling them in tongs lift up a bit of fat around the back that's the top of the leg tilt the pan and let all that fat render rendering is a chef's term that means melting the fat it works brilliantly when you're cooking a rib eye as well cut it over that color there beautiful now it looks like an expensive cut and we've got that nice even sear all over as it's cooking just tilt the pan and vase and basting the lamb steak just means you're sort of adding all that nice scented garlic olive oil back into the lamb [Music] now take the lamb out let the lamb rest [Music] now for the perfect rustic crouton so this bread's quite firm a couple of days old just slice it straight down the center dice it up put it into a bowl season it beautifully [Music] from there i'm gonna add some milk sounds strange adding milk to crouton but it just gives it that nice rich creamy texture and just let that milk sort of absorb into the bread while that's soaking i'm gonna make the dressing go back to that initial garlic that was in the pan look at that beautiful into the pest and water anchovies anchovies go brilliantly well with lamb i want that nice salty vinegary flavor and a bit of kick some capers the little baby cats very sweet now just pound that to a nice paste that smells incredible next some dijon mustard a nice teaspoon and a half in a little bit of red wine vinegar two tablespoons and then our extra virgin olive oil now it's got that heat in there got a nice roasted garlic a real hearty chunky vinaigrette that sort of seeps into that lamb some fresh parsley crunch up the parsley delicious flavor parsley in nice now get your pan hot for the croutons olive oil in the pan grab the croutons and squeeze all that excess milk out not too hard i don't want them dry and in and then just fry them and the milk inside these croutons give it a nice spongy creamy delicious flavor that's the color i want nice now take them out and lightly drain them a little bit kitchen roll onto the board out [Music] to plate them just take this amazing vinaigrette and spread it get those croutons listen to them like little boulders hitting the play the lamb let's sit that on next one on the rest of the croutons on now use all those little bits and my chef in paris would kill me right now if you saw me using those because they're the ugly scraps that customers should never see but but they're the best bits croutons on and then just drop that sauce on all those little bits of the lamb and there that is a perfect way of taking a cheap cut into the premier league of dishes you

#GordonRamsay #Cooking #Food...",2022-11-25 22:16:02.926159, [Music] right one of my favorites it's a tangy fruit salad and it's for breakfast would you believe start off with a chili now give it a little rub so you can hear those seeds being released get your knife and come all the way down turn it over and just slice it into four and then finely chop that chilli i want this salad slightly hot so i'm going to use all the chili for half the seeds the seeds are where the heat is so the less you use the milder your dish nicely chopped next one of my favorite pastes tamarind paste this is quite tart quite sour but it's a wonderful compliment to the sweetness of the fruit and it goes brilliantly well with a chili palm sugar and this is where it sweetens up the dressing because it enriches it then the zest and the juice of a lime cut it into quarters and then twist the lime to maximize and all that juice out now to finish that dressing off some toasted peanuts get the pan nice and hot a little touch of salt that'll help dry roast the peanuts even quicker make sure you get a really nice dark color on those peanuts because it will really transform that dressing to crush your roasted nuts the mess free way simply wrap them in a clean cloth and use a rolling pin or a pan to bash them crush that's the hard bit done now for the fruit and here's an easy way to prep a pineapple pineapple take off the top take off the bottom and stand it up use a corner knife and follow down basically like shaving the pineapple don't worry about these little spikes there the secret behind doing it this way is not losing half the pineapple there's nothing wrong with a few brown bits it's all good fiber slice the pineapple in half and then slice down each quarter slice across and chop delicious pineapple chunks next apples and pears diced then to give a lovely fresh light note the seeded cucumber i don't want the seeds in the fruit salad the cucumber seeds will make it very watery and dilute the strength for that wonderful chili in there cucumber in for some sweetness delicious mango just slice it nicely get your dressing and just drizzle that over the fruit salad in the secret of a good fruit salad is not drowning in the dressing but really make sure that you've got that nice coating on all the fruits don't worry about just having for breakfast because this is the kind of tangy fruit salad you can have for lunch a healthy snack in the afternoon but it transforms a traditional fruit salad into something really delicious spicy fruit salad with a kick of chili trust me it's an incredible breakfast and a guaranteed pick me up in the morning there's something very scottish about porridge it's that kind of sort of great start to the day my father used to say porridge needs salt and salt only it separates the men from the boys didn't really like it who was insistent salt puts hairs on yours i used to sneak a couple of sugar lumps from cafes and put them in my porridge without him watching these days my porridge has much more flavor than just salt it's packed with fruit nuts and spices add vanilla seeds to porridge oats or oatmeal really important just to rub the vanilla through the oatmeal makes it nice and fragrant now a little teaspoon of cinnamon makes it spicier and then nutmeg [Music] already that smells incredible i quite like making this up week at a time and jack absolutely loves it now whole almonds now if you don't like that kind of crunch running through the porridge you can chop these up or blend them to a powder but i quite like the sort of texture hazelnut nuts incredibly good a really nice crunch keep your vanilla pod in there as well that just gives it even more lift and of course once it's baked just pull it out instead of sugar i'm adding sweetness with fruit fresh pears and raisins cranberries are great as well chopped apricots as well dried apricots in there dried mango i love dried fruit next pour in a pint of milk and mix this can be done the night before left in the fridge and then a couple minutes before you go to bake it add your cream now into your dish it looks quite liquid but by the time it bakes has this really nice rich crust on top and then just a nice little nutmeg on top now bake at 180 for 30 to 35 minutes then take the porridge out sprinkle on demerara sugar and grill to create a sweet golden crust and sort of glaze on top beautiful literally for three to four minutes look at that that makes me feel proud to be scottish because it's perfect for a big comfort family breakfast it's rich it's sumptuous and it's just a humble oatmeal phenomenal especially in the winter my spice baked porridge with all those nuts and fruit it's a bowl full of love to start the day [Music] delicious poached pears i love pizza ready so we're gonna poach them with a little bit of chili chili never heard of that a little bit of saffron no no now pan on take off a little slice like that so they stand up nicely and then peel okay then and then the chili you hold that up and just go down yep through and open that up okay into the water seeds in as well a little bit of water and sugar what are they holes saffron is expensive but you only need the tiniest little bit a little pinch to make that water go light and golden star nice how come it's the chinese you've like sliced it at the end and it's not put in whole i want all that flavour coming out of the chili we're going to make the most amazing star in east dust sorry stars dust should get your star nice in there seed up and then in see all those little seeds yeah and then you start grinding a little teaspoon of ginger give it a nice mix thank you meg and that's gonna dust the top of the pears once they're cooked ryan get your pears drop them in there and that's what we're going to sprinkle mmm ginger that's darwinis wow the rice is that very good that's lovely isn't it so once they're cooked cool down sprinkle that over the top right have you guys got homework yes see you guys come back shortly thank you turn that down and let them fall okay thank you guys after an eight minute simmer our pears should be ready now just get your knife on put the knife through and see how easy the knife is so that means they're soft and cooked now you can leave them in that overnight two or three days all right and they just get darker and more beautiful the good thing about the cooking liquor is that you don't throw that away because you can use that again for re-poaching beautiful i mean they look impressive they smell delicious donna don't they [Music] look at the colors nice lovely isn't it colors are an amazing one and just smells delicious and then take your little star and east dust and just dust over look at that nice looking you think of the flavor and the texture of avocado rich phenomenal i want to make it a little bit more vibrant black sesame seeds a nice pinch of chili flakes i quite like it hot a touch of salt and a touch of pepper so that nice dry combination of the lemon zest black sesame seeds and the heat the chili this is light healthy quick but so tasty sourdough bread three nice chunky thick slices open them up lightly season them little touch of olive oil brings the whole crust to life rub all that seasoning in but you can use chipotle you can use a baguette but the richness from the sourdough with the silky creaminess of avocado is mind-blowing and then get the grill up to temperature and push these down go the extra mile we've all put bread in a toaster but the difference of grilling the bread this way is extraordinary that nice smoky charcoal flavor off with the gas beautiful now the avocado you've got to treat them with love respect press on the end here as your thumb softens you can tell that avocado is ripe never press here you just end up bruising it slice down until you feel that stone in the middle and then just roll around and then it's just a little gentle twist off stone and out cut them into quarters the back of your knife peel back that skin if the avocado is nice and ripe it should just all fall away slice just take your quarters fan them out and push them into the bread the ripe of the avocado the better the flavor but look for ones free from soft spots and blemishes which can suggest bruising get your lemon squeeze that will stop the avocado from discoloring and then get your crunch ready to go on top sprinkle in a very generous light way you've got the fragrance from the lemon zest the crunch from the sesame seed the heat that little chili flake which just wakes up the avocado they look expensive that for me is a delicious light start to the day avocado on sourdough toast with lemon and black sesame sprinkle you

#GordonRamsay #Cooking #Food #Vegan...",2022-11-25 22:16:02.926159, for me the secret of a great gazpacho is over ripe tomatoes peppers cucumber a little bit of heat with a garlic we've got to leave it to marinade first peppers cut around the flat edges to minimize waste then chop the nice thing about making the gazpacho there's no set recipe because you can put it together purely all tomatoes half peppers half tomatoes i like the flavor of the cucumber in there as well that gives it that freshness the secret of a great dispatcher is the longer you leave it marinating the better the flavor so if you can get this done the night before and left in the fridge the results are stunning the green and red peppers have subtly complementary flavors and go well with ripe tomatoes start off by removing the bitter core get a little knife and just put it in where the core is and twist it around and you get this little core out i remember my first experience eating a gazpacho in spain mind blowing i've never forgotten that quarter your tomatoes keeping the juicy seeds that add so much depth of taste nice then from there cucumber just peel that the seeds i'm gonna leave in that gives it the flavor and the texture cucumber and gazpacho does exactly what it does in a pims it sort of freshens it up and makes it mouth-watering slice that in half again into quarters and chop now to give gazpacho its unique texture and thicken the soup bread and the crispy the crust the better then garlic thinly sliced next spring onions nice and roughly chopped and basil stalks and all we can use stalks and basil stalks parsley stalks tarragon stalks they have the most amazing flavor basil in and now we'll start marinating salt black pepper and a good coating of olive oil this gives it a glossy creamy flavor and the cherry vinegar that's the perfect vinegar for the gazpacho it's a strong acidic complement to the flavors and just mix it up and the smell already is incredible it doesn't look like a gazpacho but by the time this marinades and all those flavors start getting to know one another all of a sudden you've got this huge explosion of contrast now push that down in the restaurants we press the marinade down overnight a couple of big pans on top and we crush all the ingredients and then blitz it the next day the flavor is extraordinary leave all those fresh ingredients packed with goodness to marinade from half an hour to even overnight and then when you blend it it just comes together like this sumptuous rich delicious chilled soup to go with my super tasty soup i've got an ultra healthy and exciting dessert carpaccio of pineapple which is a chefy way of saying super thinly sliced it's done with a twist we're gonna have a delicious flavoured salt has to be flavored with vanilla simply scrape out the vanilla seeds and add to sea salt along with the pot to store now that basically keeps river there's no sale by date because it's salt and vanilla so so fragrant so delicious you don't need much of this fragrant salt to intensify the sweetness of the pineapple pineapple [Music] sliced peeled pineapple into wafer thin pieces it's almost like nice little discs slightly transparent [Music] once you've sliced the pineapple take the flavor to another level a light sprinkle of vanilla salt and arrange the pineapple in a flower shape [Music] it's a beautiful way of finishing a meal the fragrance other than the crunch with the salt and the vanilla salt just marinades the pineapple beautifully then scatter nutrient rich pomegranate seeds over the top to finish finely shredded fresh mint just slice them really thin and then that'll give that nice cool minty flavor pineapple my carpaccio is ready and my gazpacho has been marinating in the fridge time to blend the soup in onto your blender and start off nice and slowly blend until super fine and gloriously silky and serve refreshingly cold get your bowl and pour it in now to finish it get some fresh basil roll it nice and tight and shred it and then drop it into your bowl fresh chopped basil and then finally just a touch of extra virgin olive oil just to give that really nice additional freshness and look at that healthy and delicious gazpacho soup to me is a taste of mediterranean sunshine in a bowl followed by the wafer thin capacity of pineapple with jewels of pomegranate goodness for dessert practically all of your five a day in one incredible healthy lunch my next simple salad that's perfect for a party is green bean salad with mustard dressing [Music] for the dressing wrap a whole bulb of garlic in foil and roast it in a hot oven next add top and tail green beans to salted boiling water and cook for just a couple of minutes this is called blanching and keeps the beans deliciously crunchy [Music] strain the beans and refresh in cold water this stops the cooking process so they stay crisp and green [Music] next remove your garlic from the oven [Music] cut off the head and squeeze out all the glorious garlic which has gone creamy mellow and divine in the oven [Music] then simply add sharp white wine vinegar a dollop of dijon mustard and sweet runny honey season and pour in a good glug of olive oil then whisk [Music] add the crunchy blanched green beans and topped with toasted almonds for a lovely nutty note and crunchy texture mix well and serve [Music] heavily mustard vinaigrette with a hit of mellow roast garlic stunning green beans dressed to perfection [Music] my next salad that's great for any big bash is roasted red pepper lentil and herb salad [Music] add pre-lentils to vegetable stock along with a bay leaf and boil for 15 minutes pre lentils are perfect for sellers they have a great meaty flavor and a delicious bite for texture next chop sweet red peppers and place on a baking tray along with diced courgette drizzle over olive oil season and roast in a hot oven to assemble the salad place the drain lentils in a large bowl [Music] then add olive oil [Music] and chop some blush tomatoes take the roasted red peppers and courgettes from the oven and add along with chopped avocado as its delicious creamy flesh gives the salad a lovely contrast [Music] season then for a big herby hit chop a handful of chives and basil and add squeeze over lemon juice and mix earthy aromatic and packed full of goodness absolutely stunning so with

treated myself to the most amazing bold breakfast and it started off with these beauties here murgays cheap but incredibly tasty start off with a nice hot pan mug is in it's a very spicy sausage doesn't need any help doesn't need any chili just a touch of salt and pepper you can smell the spice they're starting to release all that wonderful oil that flavor in there add a couple of cloves i'll finely slice garlic spread the garlic across the pan it instantly changes color takes on this nice dark rich golden colour now take a look at the heat out with the parsley the stalks of soft herbs like parsley and coriander can be used to impart flavor during cooking but the leaves should always be added just before serving to give maximum color and fragrance [Music] and then finish that off with my capers amazing beautiful now take your quest on they're literally 24 hours old so they're crispy on the outside and just slice off the lid this recipe is a great way to use up any leftover croissants from the day before i used to cringe when i saw the french cooks throw away croissants i used to cry thinking oh my god any idea what you're throwing away in terms of flavor whatever you do do not wipe out that pan dunk your croissants mopping up all that amazing flavor and caramelizing the inside for that beautiful and don't forget the lids and then get your thumbs and go inside the croissant all i want to do now is just create a little pocket and just manipulate the quest on now this is where it gets exciting mix up the capers the garlic and sausages look at the color of that wonderful delicious flavored oil now some cheese but not just any cheese fontina cheese is like the number one cheese for grilling and because it's a very rich cheese you shave it thinner than you would a white truffle but it gives a really nice saltiness and a light smokey flavor a little touch of pepper salt place these big boys on the tray literally 30 seconds on the grill here we go nice crisp packs full of flavor now top them and that for me it's almost like being back in paris except this time i don't have to share them with the french my ultimate big and bold breakfast murgies and fontina stuffed croissants a great way to start the day that is the rib eye we've had that in the fridge not wrapped so it sort of almost air dries and it intensifies the flavor gross so much quicker and there's less water in the beef for me the only downside to perfect roast dinner is the fight about who washes up afterwards so meg and i are going to avoid that by cooking everything in one roasting tin starting with the spinach and mushroom stuffing [Music] let's do it with a salt and pepper please good girl some of your left shoulder left shoulder thank you in with the garlic and the mushrooms to toss the pan you push down and pull back down and push back off you go take your time push it down and flip very good that's it push down nice that was lovely and again nice i'm gonna drop let's see well done well done well then right we're gonna sort of make a little well a little touch of butter in the middle now we need to start putting the spinach in the middle piece so you can push that down spinach is cold so you're not gonna burn yourself be confident in the pan toss it and you'll see it wilting and disintegrating away wow who would have thought all that spinach could fit in this pan because it's a very delicate leaf it sort of cooks so quickly put this all on your board now and then i just want you to go and give that a nice chop then when you're confident with one hand we need to pick up the other knife the other hand chop it nicely good now outside and come in gently good regroup and take your time yes mmm right i love that smell what is that lemon thyme lemon tan that's right so you get your little thyme stalks and you pour down you sort of strip lemon thyme in now target more tastes brilliant with the beef fantastic with chicken and fish roughly chop the tarragon and i sprinkle the fresh breadcrumbs so the breadcrumbs almost sort of bring the stuffing together next we're gonna get an egg yolk now with the beef this is the exciting part slice with the bone and then come inside and go two thirds of the way down hold that open for daddy salt and pepper and then look we pack our stuffing in there this is amazing it's incredible now just gently hold out there like that okay yeah i'll see you tomorrow what tying string around the rib will keep it all together during roasting not too tight if we tie it too tightly what happens the stuffing will come out that's right that's ready for roasting but we're gonna protect it and sit it on a trivet so trivet basically is almost like a sort of little little bed a little bed that's right if you want to enjoy these delicious roast vegetables at their best make sure you remove them from the hot oven after 35 minutes and reheat before serving with your beef now a little mix for the top a couple of teaspoons of mustard powder in salt a couple of tablespoons of olive oil mix that in i'm gonna pour my mustard powder over the beef so this forms a really nice glaze my one pot roast dinner goes into a hot oven 15 minutes at 230 degrees then down to 170 degrees for another two hours for a delicious twist on traditional yorkshire puds i'm gonna lace mine with fresh horseradish [Music] start with plain white flour in a bowl and crack in the eggs adding only half of your milk at this stage makes it much easier to whisk all the lumps out and if like me you like your puddings a little lighter and crispier add a dribble of cold water and add salt to season when you're happy your batter is lump free whisk in the remaining milk peel and grate horseradish and add a handful to the mix we can leave the batter to rest while we get the meat from the oven that is beautiful and this is where you really need to let it rest how long would you say to rest it for um i like to rest the meat for at least 20 minutes just the right amount of time for us to whack up the oven and to get our yorkshire puddings in i love using the rich dripping but best of all is a healthier option to get the fluffiest yorkshires your tray and fat must be piping hot for best results take your jug of batter to the oven and pour the mixture in there it takes just 15 minutes for our yorkshire puds to puff themselves up and turn a delicious golden brown lift that up place that onto the board parsnips parrots you can see why we kept them in halves they've got all that flavor one beautiful big slice for daddy one for maggie and then on the side it's stuffing the stuffing a bit that's the best to die for now fantastic yorkshire they're amazing aren't they beautiful mm-hmm that's been my daddy i met one that's for me beautiful roast beef with a twist wow [Music] these are my odyssey river beef with horseradish spiked yorkshire puds am i gonna help with some pickling please oh definitely no you love pickles right love pickles um favorite pickle what is it i like pickled onions we're gonna do pickled celery mm-hmm it's a nice little snack and great for planned ones great for salads first thing we need to pick the celery for me so you see where the next one's gonna be it's in there yeah okay i'll figure it out but i'm hungry today is this all we're having for dinner jack come on i wouldn't do that too you know that there's more coming now because we're pickling it we want to sort of make it look a little bit more attractive so we go around like that okay on an angle so when you pick all the food does it does it preserve it it's exactly what it does but also gives it a really nice salty soury flavour yeah okay now splash of water and then with the sugar nice okay so got to bring that up to the

sticky garlicky onion base glaze with a couple of spoons of vodka in lovely chopped tomatoes in little touch of water look at the color on that sauce check the seasoning that's delicious bring that up to the boil and cook it out six to eight minutes reduce it down slowly turn down the gas and let that simmer with my sauce simmering i can move on to a delicious breadcrumb topping to dress my linguini i'll fry off my breadcrumbs get them nice and crispy but don't put too much oil in there otherwise the bread will just absorb it they become greasy beautifully season them and they go really nice and golden brown 30 seconds before they come out flat leaf parsley roll that through your breadcrumbs and that is gonna finish the linguine on top you can hear how crispy they are before i cook the linguini i'm gonna make the chili butter that will flavor my lobster get your chili and slice it i want to take advantage of all those seeds chili in a touch of salt a nice clove of garlic here's some parsley [Music] start breaking that down but i'm looking for a lovely garlic chili paste exactly like that now don't overdo it with the butter herb butters are a great way to flavor fish and meat they can be used as a stuffing in dishes like chicken kiev or added towards the end of a dish as a delicious glaze lobsters they're already cooked so firmly place the lobster flat on your board there's a little crisscross here line there and line going across put the point of the knife in and just push through the head turn the lobster around cut through the lobster snap the legs off snap the claws off just get the back of your knife crack them spread that beautiful butter on go into the heads as well and then the claws take off bits of the shell and get little bits of butter in there this can be done way in advance for me the longer that chili butter sits on top of that lobster the better the flavor especially when they hit the grill while my lobster firms up in the fridge i can finish cooking my linguini water brought up to the boil seasoned nicely and a little touch of olive oil now linguine in first that's going to take the longest eight to ten minutes in as linguine

disaster on the big day two as well as tasting phenomenal they have to be easy to serve so you can relax and enjoy yourself three when you're out to impress food needs to look great too my first recipe fits the bill perfectly stuffed lamb with spinach and pine nuts stuffed meats are perfect for special occasions they look impressive taste amazing but more importantly they are so simple to do pan on for the stuffing it's a saddle of lamb basically a sort of rolls-royce cut perfectly shaped and it suits stuffing to an absolute tea for the stuffing finely chop an onion garlic nice thin slices oil in onions and garlic in [Music] salt and pepper make sure the stuffing is beautifully seasoned so it helps to season the inside of the lamb now we've got the color on those onions we're gonna throw in some pine nuts and that helps to give a bit of a texture here's where it starts getting really exciting spinach in and just lay the spinach over the pine nuts it looks like a lot of spinach that's going to condense and disappear almost instantly there's so much more flavor in spinach when you saute it as opposed to steaming it or boiling it gas off look at that now to bring that together no eggs no breadcrumbs crumpled feta over the spinach feta cheese adds a beautifully salty sharp and creamy flavor what this does it brings that stuffing together now open up the lamb keep those little fillets to the side that's the channel that we want to stuff so i want to just open that up a little bit there salt and pepper lightly and before we put our stuffing in we're going to season it with sour sumac is a wonderful lemony spice that goes brilliantly with lamb and you can get it in most big supermarkets and it sort of cuts through that thick rich sweetness of the lamb open up that lamb there take a spoon if you're preparing this for the day ahead then let the stuffing cool down it's inevitable when you start rolling it and tying it something's gonna squeeze out so load up the ends take these beauties these little fillets and just support that stuffing and sort of increase that beautiful tunnel and then from there over there and bring that towards you and then roll like i said some of the stuff is going to come out now we've tied it first off around the side and don't worry about some flash butcher's knot just tie it one in the middle you can get butcher string from your local butcher or at cookware shops i got two ties go too thai it just forces all that stuffing out of the lamb when it's in the oven nice now we just season the top of it the joint to make sure all the skin gets seasoned now you think normally that just goes in the oven like that that's how my mum would do it but get your tray onto the gas oil in it really nicely colored none of your stuffing is coming out the sides really important look at that color beautiful it does kick start the roasting process gas off into the oven cook for 45 to 55 minutes depending on how pink you want your lamb lift the lamb out of the fat to rest resting it raised up in the tin will stop it cooking but not cool it down too quickly and means you won't lose any of those lovely juices next i'm making a simple but sophisticated accompaniment for the lamb top and tell the cucumber peel it cut the cucumber into three and just core taking out all that it's just sort of watery seedy and it spoils the flavor slice the cucumber cucumber in really nice way of making a cheap and cheerful cucumber look glamorous we're gonna dress that cucumber with a nice fresh yogurt couple of tablespoons next some fresh mint dressing a touch of salt a touch of pepper and then pomegranate molasses that just sweetens it up finish that with lemon mix that up lamb it's rested carefully take off the string and then just gently pull them back straightened edge knife that's going to cut through that crispy fat on the outside instantly i tied it purposely so i can get my portion control from the lines hold it nice and firmly look at your line where the string was and look this one is going to be amazing lay and down just in those two slices there it proves that stuffing meat is for special occasions because that is a saddle of lamb at its absolute best stuffing meats and fish not only makes them look fantastic it also gives them an extra added flavor dimension too once you've mastered the technique you'll be able to turn out dishes that will guarantee you'll have an unforgettable feast my next recipe turns what used to be a decidedly unfashionable cut off meat into the star of the dish fit to grace any table slow roasted pork belly with fennel [Music] slow roasting works better on fattier tougher and unfashionable cuts whether it's a cheek or even a neck or this amazing pork belly it's a fantastic way to transform cheap cuts into amazing melting perfection take a very sharp knife bring the pork belly towards you so you're over and you've got all that pressure and weight using the tip of the knife i'm just sort of nicking it and go across the pork belly long strokes with a knife take your time turn it 180. this time what we're doing is just sort of cutting those nice little sort of diamonds but as that starts roasting on top it starts getting nice and crispy take little handfuls of salt and just sort of rub it in bend it over and in all those cracks really helps to get a nice crisp crackling on top roasting tray getting really nice and hot take a hole over fennel to intensify flavor and to keep the meat succulent i'm braising my pork belly with strong vibrant spices and vegetables crush and peel three whole cloves of garlic and add to the fennel olive oil in fennel in i like the nice strong aniseed flavor that goes with that nice rich dense pork fennel seeds delicious star anise in and just a couple of cardamom seeds and wow they're like little bangers like little firecrackers incredible lovely fresh bay leaves get your pork skin side down just sear the top of that fat that locks in all that amazing flavor then i'm going to flip it over and get it nice and crispy and then i want fennel seeds embedded in those little cracks now some white wine the minute that white wine hits that pan you can smell that light fragrance with fennel allow the wine to bubble away and reduce until the alcohol has burnt off time that the stock now the stock goes in just underneath the skin so it roasts on top all that meat under there will be submerged because what happens in the oven the top goes crispy as anything and the stock reduces and brazes at the same time really importantly bring that back up to the ball before it goes in the oven otherwise it will never boil never get up to temperature smells incredible slow roast the pork belly at 180 degrees for two and a half hours [Music] look at that you've got that nice crispy skin on top you can see how much of the stock has evaporated put that onto the board it looks stunning to make a delicious rustic sauce with the flavour-packed contents of the roasting tray first get rid of the excess fat take a couple of slices of bread it's like a perfect sponge because you just lay that on top and drag it almost like a net and it just absorbs all that fat if you want the perfect fried bread trust me stick that in a frying pan a nice teaspoon of mustard whisk that in and then simply simmer for a few minutes before pouring into a serving jug with your pork belly always use a nice serrated edged knife you can hear that that is amazing incredibly tender that belly of pork is gonna almost melt in your mouth you've got that sweet meat under that crispy belly of pork what an amazing way to cook a very cheap cut of meat [Music] so if a tired old recipe is getting you down spice it up with fresh ideas and flavors my next recipe is an old classic roast chicken but with a simple twist it takes on a new life and it's guaranteed to impress one of the things i love about cooking and that keeps me excited after 25 years behind the stove is that there's always something new to learn every day new ingredients new techniques and new cuisines start off with the stuffing [Music] it's amazing how exciting a stuffed roast chicken can be because it keeps the chicken incredibly moist and gives a delicious texture inside the bird i'm gonna start off with cured ceriso this is a traditional spanish sausage and it's garlicky spicy incredibly meaty that gives a little bit of sort of richness to the stuffing get that cerezo in start cooking that down and getting all those oils out a little touch of olive oil in there to get it going right onions chopped add the onions to the cerezo and in a matter of seconds they'll change color as they soak up all the flavor that lovely spiciness has been stolen from that sausage now the onions smell incredible garlic garlic fresh thyme just hold it down and put your fingers on there and it's a really nice way of taking off all those nice fragrant little time flowers you can hear it crackling in the background these are cannellini beans they're waxy very soft and so delicious but very dense but for stuffing they're so robust nothing breaks down drain them off in they're going to take on all that juice as well from this freezer i'm going to season them now because they're very dense so it needs some help i mean that looks like it's a dish on its own good enough to eat now i want to sweeten things up a little bit tomatoes half dried in that sweetens up the stuffing beautiful the stuffing's ready look at the color everything looks spanish it looks delicious now stuffing the chicken i like taking off these little knuckles as the chicken cooks the skin stretches over the bone you can get a really nice drum and take off those little wingtips as well salt pepper so important now you're stuffing i'm going to go right inside the chicken push it down this really helps to cook the bird evenly because you're pushing out all the empty spaces in the carcass and take a nice large lemon push the lemon in pick up the parsley's nose pull the skin over olive oil on top salt and pepper a teaspoon of paprika sprinkle it on and then get your hands and sort of rub that in let's see what the paprika is doing to the chicken putting this like sweet spicy marinade it's not even roasted yet but it looks delicious [Music] 400 ml of white wine same quantity of water that helps the chicken to steam chicken in be generous with the time sprigs [Music] make sure the fall is folded tightly around the roasting tray so the chicken steams in the oven keeping it moist and juicy into the oven [Music] cook for one hour at 180 degrees with a foil on nice take it out and remove the full lid then give it another 30 minutes to crisp up that skin [Music] look at that it's so important to make sure you take that tinfoil off with half an hour to go beautiful pierce that open squeeze it in that delicious gravy mix that into the tray and sieve that that's really nice fragrant lemony spiced roasting juices to finish before we cut up the chicken take out amazing stuffing [Music] incredible i'd have that with chicken over potatoes any day and then just get your chicken roasting juices now to cut the chicken up hold the drum and slice straight through and there's a wonderful drum and the thigh through the wishbone off slice with the point at an angle so you can see the texture of that amazing roast chicken just take my cooking juices just want to give a really nice sort of lemony flavor over my chicken and there you go a delicious very charming stuffed roast chicken [Music] you

a ramsey family tradition on christmas day smoked salmon scrambled egg and croissant it's rich sumptuous and incredibly easy to do first the croissants slice them into rounds and season them lightly with salt and pepper the secret behind a really good breakfast is in the timing i want the questions on first smoked salmon on top and then the scrambled egg put the croissants in a dry pan and toast you don't need oil because the questions have a lot of butter in them this is a great way to transform day old croissants giving them a delicious new life just start to see them toasting almost in the pan and that's the butter inside that smell is amazing almost smells like a sort of caramelized waffle absolutely delicious toast them all around both sides and then out next just get the smoked salmon and sort of twist it and let it fall over the question let it sit naturally on top of the toasted cressel [Applause] a little twist and over right scrambled eggs eggs into the pan never whip up the eggs beforehand you break down the egg too much what i want is really nice rich creamy scrambled egg eggs in no seasoning at this stage a nice generous knob of butter now from there onto the heat and all we're going to do now is stir stir and stir and stir [Music] now the butter's melting and it's giving a really nice creamy texture to the eggs it looks rich delicious sumptuous luxurious if you're very careful making scrambled egg all of a sudden it looks runny and within 30 seconds it's cooked working it all the time right after stirring i place this scraper in there take the pan off the heat and just work round the pan cleaning up all that scrambled egg that's sticking to the bottom and now look we're getting that really nice sort of creamy beautiful texture a little touch of butter in there now i'm going to start with the seasoning 30 seconds on the end salt pepper back on to the stove and a tablespoon of cream the cream actually stops the scrambled egg from overcooking cream in and then fold that in there now keep that off the heat but look at it look at that color beautiful and then finally some fresh chives [Music] that is a randy classic smoked salmon toasted croissant and a delicious scrambled egg the best start to christmas day anyone could wish for that's good making a stunning pork apricot and pistachio stuffing the day before is a great way to get ahead it's easy to do looks a million dollars and tastes absolutely delicious christmas dinner for me is not about food piled high on a plate less is more i'd rather have five or six things on a plate that tastes absolutely delicious than 10 items tasting average stuffing for instance i'd much rather put a lot more effort into the stuffing and enjoy it but eat a lot less of it first add pork mince to the bowl season with salt and pepper and mix take your grater and a bravo an apple just get the grater and grate the apple in there usually stuffing is cooked in the turkey but i'm doing mine separately so i can make in advance and get the flavour and presentation spot on now the nice thing about the apple it goes brilliantly well with the pork it makes it a little bit sweeter it also makes it a lot lighter as well which is really important next add a handful of chopped apricots which gives the stuffing another fruity note and a lovely texture the apple disintegrates but the apricots stay really nice intact nice little bite then chop a handful of pistachio nuts again i'm thinking of the build-up of textures flavor and also color pistachio's in now give that a really good mix grating some lemon zest the zest is packed full of intensely flavored essential oils which gives the stuffing a vibrant citrus thing [Music] and for freshness add a handful of coarsely chopped parsley the balance of flavors is nice and delicate and it sits beautifully with a turkey now sage and pork and apple that's the perfect marriage now i'm going to think about the presentation skills tim full a little drizzle of olive oil and then we get a really nice fragrant sage leaves the sage leaves are used to wrap the stuffing start by overlapping them it's almost like rolling a cigar but we're gonna roll it in sage leaves taste is paramount but presentation is really important too so it's worth spending a few extra minutes to get this right because it will make the final dish look amazing now a little season across the top [Music] and then take your sausage meat and we want to do now is put half it onto the plate [Music] that's what you run your finger along the stuffing this is where it takes on a completely different flavor again i need some spice in there i want a little bit of heat in the stuffing so it's exciting to eat murgays murgays are traditional north african sausages made from beef or lamb and all we're going to do now is take the sausage and lay that in the middle they're flavored with harissa a fiery chilli paste which gives them their heat and distinctive color it really does give that nice sort of wake-up call inside the stuffing if you can't get hold of merguez other spicy sausages like chorizo would work well too take the rest of the stuffing and we'll sit that on top so in cases that murgays [Music] once you've got it like that lift up the tinfoil very carefully and roll that over let the temple do the work roll it nice and tight there fingers underneath [Music] just pull that back and double check lovely look at it it's not even cooked yet and it looks delicious the ultimate christmas cracker fantastic that sage will cook and really perfume the sausage meat and you cut through to the center you've got a nice spicy sausage lovely in now roll it across twist at the ends and then from there up into the hands and you push it in and twist and turn and all that's doing is just making the perfect cylinder the stuffing can be made wrapped and stored in the fridge a day or two in advance that's the first part of my ultimate christmas dinner ready on christmas day simply pop it into the oven and cook at 200 degrees for 40 minutes [Music] sources are one of the important ways chefs add extra dimension and flavor to dishes you can use this trick at home my caramelized cranberry and apple sauce is another recipe i always cook a day in advance it packs a wonderful punch that really lifts the subtle flavor of the turkey it's simple to make and with its deep red vibrant color looks fantastic on the plate the secret behind any good christmas is in the organization and preparation anything you can get done in advance do it apple and cranberry sauce is a prime example first things first we're gonna make a really nice caramel sugar in at 150 grams of caster sugar to a pan followed by a couple of star in ease that helps to really give a nice sort of aniseed flavor to the cranberries next lightly crushed four cardamom pods this has a lovely warm spicy sweet flavor then wait for the sugar to melt and form a caramel really important have the confidence now to colour that caramel so it gets really nice and dark before putting the cranberries in [Music] [Applause] [Music] wow the smell of that caramel is amazing now cranberries in cranberries are very tart and acidic but balance with the sweetness of the caramel and apples they give the sauce a lovely dry sharp note to tell if they're fresh drop them on a hard surface the higher they bounce the fresher they are the secret now is for caramel to blister the cranberries and really start to break that down smells fantastic next core peel and thinly slice two apples and once this sauce is finished it really does help to sort of wake up the flavor of the turkey now the cranberries are starting to break down apple in smells fantastic a touch of salt and pepper that's really important really helps to balance that tartness against the acidity of the apple salt and pepper really brings it back the smell is fantastic it's a sort of sweet sour spicy nice now from there delays the pan with a touch of port around the side the glazing dissolves all the lovely sticky caramelised bits of food that are stuck to the pan and incorporates them into the sauce next add the zest of an orange and for another layer of fragrant sweetness squeezing the juice lovely then cook on a low heat for five to ten minutes to thicken but remember the sauce will become even thicker once it's cooled down now that is the right texture i don't want a runny sauce i want something really nice and thick delicious packed full of flavor perfect if you really want to get ahead this sauce can be made three or four days in advance and kept in the fridge which allows the flavors to develop even more then on christmas day simply bring it up to room temperature and serve another job done leaving you more time to enjoy this very special day [Music] this dish is another twist on tradition it gives the potatoes a lovely color and their spicy kick helps complement and lift the whole christmas meal we're just gonna do again a little twist the potatoes we do need some gooseberry uh goose fat and we're gonna do a really nice um lightly spiced roast potato okay a little chili flake really yeah chili flake just put a little bit of heat in there for the christmas lunch yup chili flake and a little bit of turmeric i can't believe you're doing roast potatoes with chili now would you be so kind just to give them a little cut cut the peeled potatoes into quarters and put into salted cold water in they go okay bring them up to the boil and simmer for around eight minutes drain and let them steam then season with salt and pepper on there and just a little teaspoon of chili flake oh no that's the sort of thing i would make for supper in a saturday night or something you know really chili flakes in add a teaspoon of turmeric turmeric is a member of the ginger family it stains the potatoes a wonderful golden color and has a lovely earthy taste next drizzle in a little olive oil and shake to coat them just let them roll around yeah that smells nice beautiful could you get me the stuffing please from the fridge put in a preheated baking tray with extra olive oil and cook at 200 degrees celsius for about 40 minutes give it a little shake to make sure they don't stick and then i'll just stick the stuffing up on top here now that will take roughly about the same time as potatoes stuffing in potatoes done nice why are you going to play with the kids i will do here okay see you shortly thank you bye [Applause] [Music] christmas dinner wouldn't be complete without brussels sprouts but when i was a child they were boiled until horribly soft i want to keep my sprouts crisp vibrant and fresh sauteed with pancetta and chestnuts these are sprouts like you've never tasted before and brussels sprouts are delicious when they cook perfectly packed with texture and the flavor is extraordinary take off the outer leaves trim the bottom and cut in half that's a big step up from the crisscross on the bottom that my mother used to do every christmas i'm cutting them in half so when i soda them they cook evenly and look it's like little baby cabbages it's so compact then blanch them in salted boiling water for two minutes [Music] now this is the most amazing pancetta lightly cured pancetta is a type of italian bacon which is brilliant for adding a lovely rich meaty flavor to dishes i want a really nice robust flavor to go with that earthy texture of the sprout it's made from pork belly and is dry cured with salt and aromatics like juniper bay leaves nutmeg dry thyme and garlic as it hits the pan that fat on top of the pancetta melts and gives the sprouts this amazing flavor after removing the skin cut into small chunks if you can't get hold of pancetta smoked streaky bacon is a good alternative now hot pan a teaspoon of olive oil give it a nice seasoning with salt and pepper as the lavender start to crisp up take your sprouts out drain them [Music] sprouts in now give that a really nice little toss then chop up a handful of chestnuts now the chestnut's sweetened with the flavor of the sprout really important that you don't put the chestnuts in too early otherwise they'll go mush and then just sprinkle the chestnuts over lovely so we've managed to turn a sort of plain jane sprout into something quite delicious you got the texture of the smoked bacon the sauteed sprout and that nice crunch and sweetness of the festive chestnut ten seconds before they come out lemon zest over now that makes the sprouts and the bacon harmonize and then just a squeeze of fresh lemon juice over the sprouts beautiful this right now is the ultimate and for me that's a really nice modern 21st century approach to cooking an old-fashioned vegetable [Music] right listen i need some help okay we're gonna make the most amazing pumpkin soup feel that's heavy it's very heavy but it is gonna be absolutely delicious right you can always tell okay if it's ripe it what does that sound like um drums that's right and if you push your thumb in there it should be just a little bit soft right at the bottom of the root right first of all i'm going to cut it in half and very carefully just cut through i'm using a french pumpkin but these versatile vegetables come in all shapes and sizes and colors at this time of year their nutty sweetness is ideal for warming soups curries and roasts wait and see what happens when we open this up wow right holly that's for you now this is where it's going to get a little bit gory okay you get your hands and you scrape the seeds out getting messy rub them together and just give them a little clean nice and gently good yeah nice look at that yuck what do you mean yuck come on holly that's it into the water now once the seeds are out we're gonna toast them in the oven as a little snack so this is a really nice way i'm not wasting anything get your fingers right in there tilly there you go [Music] once the pumpkin seeds are out score the flesh to help it roast and absorb flavor season and have a generous amount of rosemary take the garlic rub round the outside so it perfumes the inside then add a large glug of olive oil and as the garlic grows with the rosemary its sweet almost buttery nutty taste will mellow and flavor the pumpkin all the seeds done yeah almost good after the pumpkin seeds have been cleaned dry and season them ready for the oven now they're gonna roast in the oven for about 45 to 50 minutes well done good i'm waiting to smell the house in about five minutes time tray please holly so beautiful straight in right well done big question have you wrapped mummy's present yet no let's go i'll give you a hand quickly got that garlic smells amazing [Music] holly tilly where's holly she's going to a party she's going to a party oh no any boys there i don't know oh you're so diplomatic right look they are now toasted hear that right have a little taste one of those nice yeah but look at this wow that looks amazing and that is your roasted pumpkin now you put the spoon down the side okay yeah scooping out all that lovely roast pumpkin we don't waste anything hear that skin all into the center roasting a pumpkin intensifies the rich sweet flavor of its flesh which is lovely for soups but also great as a filling for ravioli or making a delicious mash with butter nutmeg and salt and pepper that's the pumpkin done now what i want you to do is get these mushrooms here and just peel them lengthways okay onto the plate okay and i'll get my onion chopped olive oil in okay nice and generous the olive oil because what this soup do really nice and velvety onions in [Music] and then scoop out that wonderful garlic that's been roasted on the pumpkin lovely a little bit of nutmeg on top of the onions onions garlic nutmeg yeah and now the pumpkin wow say that yeah and you would come in handy somewhere this little baby it's for you there you go perfect now i want you just to grate some parmesan like that for me okay just so i can start roasting off the parmesan as well so we get this really nice rich delicious pumpkin parmesan's brilliant for enriching this soup it's mellow caramel flavour and saltiness provide a lovely balance to the sweet pumpkin now what i want you to do is dip all that in there okay yeah good [Music] at that now that huh smell that roasted sort of cheesy rosemary garlicky yeah olive oily beautiful so far nothing's gone to waste we've used the whole pumpkin now i'm gonna add the stock my hand was cooked in it smells like cinnamon it doesn't doesn't it smells christmassy delicious just from cooking our ham bring that up to the boil we'll let that cook out for 10 minutes cream really important that it's boiling when the cream goes in okay you'll see the color lightening so that's gonna give it a really nice rich creamy taste okay now we're gonna study the mushrooms a little olive oil in there yeah get nice and hot we'll go first with the trumpet de la mor there you go good girl then the pier de mouton in and then finally chantel nice lovely i want to put a little bit of butter in there nothing good good girl a little bit better there nice i love the deep complex flavor of wild mushrooms but if you can't get them chestnut or filled mushrooms still deliver great taste mushrooms work really well with pumpkin because they have a warm earthy flavor that complements the pumpkin beautifully so mushrooms into the center yeah from there we get the parmesan and just peel nice long layers watch very carefully not just sit there on top on the parmesan helps to season the mushroom and really give off an amazing flavor okay we're going to blend the soup and all we're going to do is half fill the blender so the soup gets really nicely aerated now this is a bit of a naughty chef's trick a little knobber butter in there just in top so when it blends it gets really nice and smooth lid on onto the blender and we'll just pulse it on and off first nice wow and this is the moment we'll be waiting for just one side of the bowl so that's daddy's portion that this little bit is yours now a little taste low gently [Music] love that sound christmas is here mold wine is a real christmas classic but i'm going to give it a modern 21st century twist first pour red wine into a pan and gently heat now i'm gonna make a fragrant bokeh garlic basically a really nice aromatic tea bag muslin cloth absolutely perfect for this if you haven't got muslin cloth a brand new j cloth is just as good now first off cardamom pods they are incredibly aromatic and more importantly gives it a really nice dense spicy flavour next add a pinch of cloves close the dried flower buds and add a lovely pungent sweet flavour then drop in a couple of star anise which adds an aniseed nose a cinnamon stick cinnamon sticks are made from the bark of trees native to sri lanka break one in and this gives a warm sweet spice to the wine lemongrass so this makes it slightly asian here a little bit more sort of exciting but gives a really nice light twist to the wine i'm gonna do first is just press down on the lemongrass and what that does it starts to release all that oil and flavor once it's crushed just cut it over the muslin cloth once all your spices are in fold up the muslin cloth and tie tightly and look that is like a little miniature perfect chest pillow into the wine next add orange zest twist then cut the orange into wedges and pop those in too to sweeten the wine put in a tablespoon of demerara sugar next stem ginger gives the mulled wine a little bit of a sort of kick almost like that really nice sort of ginger beer aftertaste at the back of your throat finally a couple of tablespoons of the ginger syrup and then simply heat the wine gently for four to five minutes to infuse all the fantastic flavors but don't let it boil or the alcohol will evaporate and to go with that the most amazing spice nuts [Music] i love nuts so i'm using brazil's almonds walnuts and hazelnuts and then finally pistachios lovely really nice festive mix as the nuts toast they start to release their natural oils then add a couple of pinches of salt and then just let them lightly toast once the nuts start to color add half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper which is made from ground chilies then sprinkle in half a teaspoon of paprika a mild spice made from dried pimentos for sweetness and depth [Music] and now you can see the nuts absorbing all that wonderful flavour delicious finally put in a sprig of rosemary give the pan a good toss to make sure all the nuts are thoroughly coated and they're done [Music] my next recipe for panna cotta takes all the right boxes it's easy to make and has a silky smooth texture that makes it one of the world's sexiest desserts [Music] first add 250 milliliters of cream to a pan then pour in 50 mils of milk and add 50 grams of caster sugar get the sugar in early because it stops the milk and cream from boiling over give that a little stir bring that out to the bowl panna cotta which means cooked cream in italian can be flavoured with anything from vanilla to coffee to chocolate i'm giving mine a grown-up kick with a splash of rum in once the cream has come to the boil take it off the heat and add a couple of leaves of gelatin that have been soaked in cold water and squeezed dry then whisk them in and the gelatine sets the cook cream so we want that really nice sort of blemonge texture rich silky and incredibly smooth once the gelatin has dissolved pour the panna cotta straight into serving glasses traditionally it's set in moulds then turned out onto a plate but i'm keeping mine simple leave a little space on top for the glaze now set them into the fridge beautiful next the pomegranate glaze add some castor sugar to the pan and pour in pomegranate juice then simply bring it to the boil and reduce it down to the consistency of a sticky syrup [Music] in iran where pomegranates originated they use this sweet sticky syrup to flavor chicken and game birds a beautiful rich sticky glaze pour that into a jar leave that to cool down take the panna cotta from the fridge they set beautifully and they're not too firm just slightly bouncy a little bit springy on top carefully pour the cooled pomegranate glaze over just roll them around a little bit just to fill those edges finally take a bar of chocolate that's been chilled in the freezer so it's easier to use and scrape off thin shards almost like sort of chocolate gold leaf and sprinkle it on top [Music] first slice open a vanilla pod and scrape out the seeds now the flavor in those seeds is mind blowing look at it beautiful now two whole eggs in two give that a whisk [Music] next add 125 grams of unsalted butter to the mixer once the butter's soft add 90 grams of caster sugar and cream them together until they're lovely and smooth gradually pour in the beaten eggs and vanilla seeds add a pinch of salt and beat thoroughly until the mixture becomes paler [Music] then put in 250 grams of plain flour and mix until it forms a dough it should just be nice and firm slightly soft and not too wet perfect be careful because you're holding your hands for too long it starts to melt flour your hands on the board and shape the dough into a circle it's got a really nice soft sensual sexy feel really nice and creamy now roll it out to the thickness of one centimeter cut out a large circle then put it onto a baking tray lined with parchment and decorate [Music] half again just like my grandma used to make thumb in and in chill the shortbread for an hour to help it set then bake it in a medium oven for 20 minutes until it turns a pale golden color just sprinkle a little bit of sugar really nice to do when it's just come out so it's sort of it melts into the shortbread nice and generous and that's perfect for a cup of tea mid-afternoon as well as filling your biscuit tin over christmas this shortbread can easily be transformed into a great festive dessert using a hot spoon scoop out lozenges of creme fraiche and sit that on top then grate over the zest of a clementine and finish with clementine halves the tartness of the creme fraiche works with the sweetness of the clementine [Music] you

Pre-order your copy of Ramsay in 10 here - https://linktr.ee...",2022-11-24 22:16:02.926159, i don't want to spend christmas in the kitchen ignoring my family and friends when we're all finally together so i'm prepared with dishes that i can cook in advance that will last over christmas adding a glazed ham to your holiday menu is a great way to get ahead it's delicious versatile and the ultimate dish to have in the fridge for any hungry guests who drop by christmas would not be the same without a beautiful delicious honey glazed ham across that long christmas period this can get you out of jail quite easily ham salads ham sandwiches ham egg and chips this is a gammon what you do now is cook it so it becomes a ham into a pan first things first the water cover it completely so the whole gammon cooks evenly the important part now is adding flavor in there carrots in the leeks the more veg in there now the more fragrant the broth becomes once the ham is cooked that stock is extraordinary the base to a fantastic soup onion not finely chopped and then homemade ham stock is packed with flavor so it's great for making soups sauces stews and risottos plus it can be frozen so it's there when you need it pan down [Music] peppercorns lightly crush then to give it a christmas flavor i'm adding crushed coriander seeds two cinnamon sticks and four aromatic bay leaves up to the boil and then turn it down let it simmer and then skim it cooking a ham isn't hard but it does take time this two kilo joint takes two and a half hours to simmer before it's glazed and baked however it is worth it because it tastes absolutely delicious so the glaze very very simple demerara sugar madeira that sweetens the delays basically a fortified wine couple tablespoons in and then cherry vinegar again couple tablespoons honey in nice bring that out to the ball the longer you leave it on the stove the darker it becomes you want your hand really nice and dark then cook out the glaze for three four minutes that i'm happy with lovely [Music] right the gammon's cooked now onto the plate carefully snip the string nice and gently peel back get rid of the skin then crisscross it don't push too deep let the knife do the work stud it with some clothes [Music] look at it almost looks like an albino pineapple the blaze and just carefully cover start in the middle and let it work round oh god gently gently gently gently it's not even roasted yet and it looks amazing beautiful look at that half the delays over now into the oven 15 minutes [Music] it started to colour get the rest of the delays and pour that over look at it wow the more effort passion and love you show the ham now the results are tenfold look at it every five minutes out of the oven and glaze again now back into the oven now at 190 degrees we're gonna baste and roast for 35 minutes delicious next i'm going to make a pear and saffron chutney this is a fruity relish that works brilliantly with a sweet aromatic ham first things first slice the onion fry the chopped onion in olive oil without coloring it the important part about this stage is the fact that we're gonna layer the chutney with textures from onion to apple to pear and a nice little block of ginger grating the ginger so the ginger sort of disappears with the onions then add the spices a good grating of nutmeg followed by a teaspoon of cinnamon and a teaspoon of cayenne pepper to give it a kick delicious i recently spent a lot of time in india where chutneys originated and discovered that whereas british style chutneys tend to be cooked and are usually quite sweet indian ones are normally fresh spicier and quite sour next demo sugar [Music] once that sugar is dissolved the white wine vinegar all in that's going to give this really nice sort of sweet and sour flavor from there our fruit these are williams pears pear is the star of the chutney so keep it quite rustic next add chopped cooking apples their tartness gives a lovely contrast of the sweetness of the pears to give it great texture a handful of sultanas pinch of saffron this gives it a really nice depth a rich golden color saffron is the world's most expensive spice it's made from the dried stigmas of the saffron crocus flower and as a general rule of thumb the deeper the colour of the threads the better the quality and to make it lighter the zest and juice of two oranges the orange and the saffron go really well together just squeeze that in there this chutney is brilliant with ham fantastic in salads but equally as delicious with fish whether it's a roasted cod a grilled fillet of mackerel it goes brilliantly well bring that up to the ball cook that out for 15 minutes now tomatoes going at the end and that brings a certain amount of freshness to the chutney really helps to give that nice texture [Music] mix that in and literally cook it out for 30 seconds [Music] what's great about this chutney is that as it matures its flavor gets better and better and it will keep for up to six months fill up the jar and that is going to deliver amazing flavor across christmas [Music] and look my goodness me that is fit for a king [Music] [Music] my new version of beef wellington retains the luxuriousness which made it brilliant in the first place but gives it a seasonal lift if you want to really spoil your friends this christmas this is the perfect special occasion dish beef wellington has to be the ultimate indulgence one of my all-time favorite main courses and it would definitely be on my last supper menu my version is a lot lighter and sexier and for christmas i'm gonna give it an added twist first off the fillet of beef now look at it it's beautiful first the most important part is to sear it salt pepper the fillet is the leanest and the most expensive cut of beef it comes from underneath the lower backbone a part of the animal which has very little muscle and this is what makes it such a tender cut very very hot pan olive oil and literally roll it around the pan we're not cooking the beef we're just searing it which will really help to give another layer of flavor and beef in lovely now use the side of the pan so the beef sears down the back when you tilt it it's a secret to get it done quickly it gives that really nice roasted flavour delicious once you've got the colour very carefully lift up the beef and see it on top and sear it on the bottom out and onto the plate english mustard what this does now it gives it a bit of sort of bit of heat just lightly brush the mustard over the beef so really important that you do this as the beef comes straight out of the pan as the beef starts to cool down it absorbs all that heat from the mustard horseradish is a really nice alternative as well just leave that to sit and relax as the fillet rests prepare the filling which is called a duck sale put 700 grams of chestnut mushrooms into a blender add a chopped clove of garlic season with salt and pepper and blitz [Music] christmas wouldn't be christmas without chestnuts i just crumble them in to the mushrooms the chestnut's sweet nutty flavour works brilliantly with the earthy taste of the mushrooms and because they contain more starch and less oil than other nuts they have a much softer texture that is perfect for the filling that smells amazing smells like christmas once the mixture is finely chopped cook in a hot dry pan this removes the water from the mushrooms and intensifies the flavour [Music] you can see the water coming out instantly such an essential stage really critical to the success of the wellington that you dry those mushrooms out and get rid of all that water take the mushrooms up even further some fresh thyme in there which will make it really nice and light and fragrant when all the water's been fried off remove from the pan and leave to cool then start assembling the wellington stage one wrapping the beef fillet first of all these wonderful slices of parma ham and look beautiful overlap it and set it there so the secret of overlapping the palmer ham is to make sure it contains all those juices coming out of the beef in the traditional recipe for beef wellington a thick chive and spring onion pancake is used instead of ham but the parmesan makes the dish much lighter and its sweet salty flavor really complements the mushroom and chestnut filling a little touch of pepper no salt because the ham is naturally salty just a little twist of pepper and then from there your mushrooms and basically mushrooms go on use the back of the spoon to spread them nice and thinly half an inch from the ends rump holes no pop it every time there's meat now he comes next lay the beef on top and very carefully fold that over now we're going to lift that up and wrap the beef nice and carefully so all that mushroom and parmesan is encasing the beef all the way over push it nice and tight roll it nice and tight and go all the way over now the secret from here is to really let the clint film do the work just nip it at the ends and squeeze and what we're doing is just creating this wonderful sort of cylinder shape off and then just twist it nice and tightly and the tighter is the more perfect the shape then place in the fridge for 15 minutes to firm up [Music] once it's set it's ready for the final wrap a little bit of tim film puff pastry beef now very carefully first roll the puff pastry over the beef until the two edges meet then trim off any excess pastry and twist the ends together to ensure the beef is completely sealed in its pastry case to set that perfectly and get it really nice and firm to make it really cylinder tight clip them over [Music] and just pull that nice and tight but the big secret behind this is that it can be done the night before and the tighter the clint film the better the shape the more even the shape the more even it cooks put it back in the fridge for five minutes to fill up again then take off the climb film always like the perfect christmas cracker to give the pastry a lovely rich golden brown color when it bakes brush it with egg yolk and then finally you don't have to do this but it's a chefy thing a little bit decoration back of the knife down and then just twist and mark the pastry when it comes out the oven it's got that wow factor [Music] add a generous sprinkle of salt to ensure the pastry becomes lovely and crisp then bake in an oven at 200 degrees for around 35 minutes depending on how rare you like your beef once out of the oven it's crucial you let the wellington rest for at least 10 minutes this allows the meat to relax and reabsorb its delicious juices making sure it's tender and succulent nice and gently hear that pastry how crisp that is this is the bit we've been waiting for oh wow my god i'm in heaven and for me if you want a really nice change to roast turkey this has to be the ultimate for the table it smells christmassy the chestnuts the mushrooms and that nice crisp pastry on the outside look at it i'm ready to die and go to heaven [Applause] for a really special occasion i love to serve my beef wellington with gloriously creamy mashed potatoes and shavings of exquisite white truffle [Music] my first job on christmas day morning is to tackle the turkey and my favorite way to cook it is roasted with lemon parsley and garlic it's fantastically aromatic really easy to do keeps the meat succulent and tastes absolutely delicious for me without question the start of the christmas dinner is this a delicious turkey now once this is in the oven you're halfway there the secret success behind a great christmas dinner is making sure this doesn't turn out dry and it's all in the preparation now we're gonna make an amazing butter and this is sort of the start of the the most important part keeping that bird incredibly moist soft butter a touch of salt and pepper a little touch of olive oil in there that stops the butter from burning next add the zest of two lemons and their juice this gives the flavored butter a wonderful citrus zing three cloves of garlic turkey's a very delicate dainty meat and that's why i want the garlic pureed so it sort of disintegrates and flavors a turkey gently without becoming too overpowering then add a generous handful of chopped parsley wow that smells incredibly light give that a good mix turkey's a very very very lean bird and it dries out so it's so important to make sure that we help it to cook perfectly butter done now prepare the turkey we'll season the bird inside the cavity salt and pepper next half two onions and pop them in as they roast they steam inside the bird giving a lovely sweetness put in the lemon and a couple of bay leaves for their bitter sweet spicy flavor we're sort of lining the inside of the turkey with these fantastic sort of flavours you can see the bird is upright and it's looking sort of like it's standing to attention now it's time to add the flavoured butter just very very carefully open up the skin go through over the back of the breast and keep the skin intact the idea is to gently loosen the skin with your fingers so the butter can be stuck underneath it now once you've loosened all the skin off the top of the thighs turn the bird around and just go through here again hand up and just release a little bit but don't completely break it because i don't want all that butter to run out right from there now take your butter put it into a ball that smells amazing lemony citrusy and just sort of flatten it and stick that in there underneath one side now once you've got it in there pull back the skin and just use that to sort of slide all the way down what we want to do now is line the top of the breast with all that butter there that butter is going to keep the turkey breast really seriously moist turn the bird round and finish covering the breast with the butter turkeys originally came from north america and they're best young and plump my favorite breed for christmas is either north of black or norfolk bronze both of which have a wonderful gamey taste take the rest of the butter and carefully massage over the breast legs and wings you can do all this the night before and simply cover the turkey with tinfoil and keep it in the fridge ready to be cooked on christmas day into the tray a little touch of olive oil now olive oil on top again that protects it gets that skin really nice and crispy and it stops the butter from burning now in the oven at 220 for 10 minutes to get really nice and brown quickly in she goes beautiful [Music] that smells fantastic after 10 minutes take the turkey out of the oven and baste then cover the breasts with smoked streaky bacon what i want to do is add a little bit more flavor i'm already starting to think about my gravy so the bacon protects it stops it from drying out but it's going to start to really give my gravy a wonderful base turn down the oven to 180 degrees this five kilogram bird will feed eight people comfortably it needs roasting for two and a half hours or half an hour per kilo basting every so often [Music] back in and now she's on the way look at that beautiful it's as pretty as the christmas tree that smells fantastic wow look at that beautiful that is 90 of your work done there to test the turkey is cooked stick a knife into the bottom of the thigh and if the juices run clear it's done the secret now is to let the turkey rest uncovered for two and a half hours as the meat relaxes it reabsorbs its juices making it succulent and tender plus it'll be easier to carve it might seem like a long time to let it rest but remember the turkey doesn't need to be piping hot because i'm serving it with hot gravy that looks like a million dollars let that rest because the flavor will be ten times more exciting once it's rested the key to pulling all the different elements of your christmas dinner together on the plate is the gravy my recipe for turkey gravy made with cider and walnuts has a wonderful aptly nutty flavor which beautifully complements the turkey meat and fruity pork stuffing as that turkey's resting i want to make the most amazing gravy when i say amazing i really do mean amazing drain the excess fat from the roasting tray and put it back on the heat then remove the bacon from the top of the turkey and the roasted onions from the cavity look at them my god they smell amazing finally take out the roasted lemon first of all cut up the bacon lovely bacon into the tray hear how crispy that is that's the start of our gravy the onion look at it beautiful doesn't get any better than that chop that up onion and bacon in that smells incredible when i first got the chance to cook christmas lunch for the chefs in paris they taught me one crucial thing i was only 21 at the time and they made me rest the turkey for as long as i cooked it so i cooked it for three hours and i rested it for three hours what a difference incredible next chop up the roasted lemon and add to the tray put in a couple of sprigs of rosemary to give it a lovely aromatic punch and fry then add three chopped tomatoes which helps to thicken the gravy and give it a lovely fresh taste [Music] now it's time to really get the turkey flavor into the gravy snap off the wing take off all your little trimmings put these little bits here add that into your crayfish these are the bits we never use everyone throws them away off there that little baby there take him off i want that bang flavor delicious try that off it smells incredible next pour in the dry cider this adds a lovely subtle apple flavor that really lifts the taste of the turkey meat as the cider starts to reduce pour in the delicious resting juices from the roasted turkey wow there you go the most amazing flavor [Music] when the liquid has reduced by half crush the vegetables and the turkey pieces with a masher to extract the maximum amount of flavor and basically what's happening now is that we're giving the gravy a little bit of body pour in the chicken stock and reduce again in now a little taste wow i mean you just close your eyes wow it oozes flavor and turkey now sieve it use the back of the ladle to push it through the sieve extracting every last drop of flavour pop in a sprig of rosemary and leave to infuse ready for the finishing touch [Music] simply add crushed walnuts to the bottom of the gravy boat and ladle in the hot gravy [Music] you

we're gonna make a delicious beetroot risotto we need to get the shallots just slice them in half and then just chop them like that okay okay now have you ever made a risotto no i haven't actually shallots please into the pan for daddy add a sprinkle of salt and pepper along with a couple of crushed cloves of garlic once you start cooking the risotto it's really important to have your stock gently boiling away if we're adding cold stock on top of the rice all the time it just slows down the process generally you cook a nice wide flat pan if you cook in a deep pan all the rice sort of cooks at different temperatures what stock is that in there dad because that's a vegetable stock yeah because you can't have different stocks if it's more vegetarian can you have chicken stock i made that mistake once putting beef stock in the vegetarian soup did you no i didn't matilda are you sure i'm positive i'm joking fry off time how nice does that smell it smells delicious rice in that's a bit of a different rice this is elboria rice it's a perfect rice for risotto now it's really important to sear the rice if we were just to put the stocking without sweating off the rice it goes all starchy so keep on stirring for daddy it's just gonna make a fun day no flambe on the risotto to go with our deep red beetroot theme i'm adding red wine followed by the first ladle of stock to get things started now we're off wow it's giving it a cloudy sort of look what's happening to the stock the stock is reducing down and the rice is sucking it in that's right so the rice is actually getting nice and plump one of risotto is live when it's like this now we can't stop cooking there we have to kill it all the way okay ready for the next ladle i'm ready good girl here we go ladle in so we have to make this for literally 20 25 minutes and we're nursing it all the way beetroots peel them rub them a little bit of salt and sugar yeah and a little bit of aged balsamic vinegar in there roasted them i'm gonna grate my parmesan how's that rice doing the rice is doing good now that is exactly where we want to be now look look at that nice glossy textured rice so beetroot i want you to put two thirds of the beetroot in there for me saving one third for the top good sprinkle the parmesan in there for me please all over nice it's like it's snowing again and then we're just gonna get some nice butter in there the butter gives the risotto a really nice gloss look at that beautiful let that come down let it come down first all right get your spoon in there now for daddy beautifully there you go good wonderful shake it risotto should be like lava it just flows out and then the rest of the beetroot on top and then finish and some extra virgin olive oil on top i'll pick up the

for instance i'd much rather put a lot more effort into the stuffing and enjoy it but eat a lot less of it first add pork mince to the bowl season with salt and pepper and mix take your grater and a bravo an apple just get the grater and grate the apple in there usually stuffing is cooked in the turkey but i'm doing mine separately so i can make in advance and get the flavor and presentation spot on now the nice thing about the apple it goes brilliantly well with the pork it makes it a little bit sweeter it also makes it a lot lighter as well which is really important next add a handful of chopped apricots which gives the stuffing another fruity note and a lovely texture the apple disintegrates but the apricots stay really nice intact nice little bite then chop a handful of pistachio nuts again i'm thinking of the build-up of textures flavor and also color pistachio's in now give that a really good mix grating some lemon zest the zest is packed full of intensely flavored essential oils which gives the stuffing a vibrant citrus zing [Music] and for freshness add a handful of coarsely chopped parsley the balance of flavors is nice and delicate and it sits beautifully with a turkey now sage and pork and apple that's the perfect marriage now i'm going to think about the presentation skills tim full a little drizzle of olive oil and then we get a really nice fragrant sage leaves the sage leaves are used to wrap the stuffing start by overlapping them it's almost like rolling a cigar but we're going to roll it in sage leaves taste is paramount but presentation is really important too so it's worth spending a few extra minutes to get this right because it will make the final dish look amazing now a little season across the top [Music] and then take your sausage meat and we want to do now is put half it onto the plate [Music] that's what you run your finger along the stuffing this is where it takes on a completely different flavor again i need some spice in there i want a little bit of heat in the stuffing so it's exciting to eat merguez murgays are traditional north african sausages made from beef or lamb and all we're going to do now is take the sausage and lay that in the middle they're flavoured with harissa a fiery chilli paste which gives them their heat and distinctive colour it really does give that nice sort of wake-up call inside the stuffing if you can't get hold of murgays other spicy sausages like chorizo would work well too take the rest of the stuffing and we'll sit that on top so in cases that murgays [Music] once you've got it like that lift up the tinfoil very carefully and roll that over let the temple do the work roll it nice and tight there fingers underneath [Music] just pull that back and double check lovely look at it it's not even cooked yet and it looks delicious the ultimate christmas cracker fantastic that sage will cook and really perfume the sausage meat and you cut through to the center you've got a nice spicy sausage lovely in now roll it across twist at the ends and then from there up into the hands and you push it in and twist and turn and all that's doing is just making the perfect cylinder beautiful the stuffing can be made wrapped and stored in the fridge a day or two in advance that's the first part of my ultimate christmas dinner ready on christmas day simply pop it into the oven and cook at 200 degrees for 40 minutes [Music] apple and cranberry sauce first things first we're going to make a really nice caramel sugar in add 150 grams of caster sugar to a pan followed by a couple of star anise that helps to really give a nice sort of aniseed flavor to the cranberries next lightly crushed four cardamom pods this has a lovely warm spicy sweet flavor then wait for the sugar to melt and form a caramel really important to have the confidence now to colour that caramel so it gets really nice and dark before putting the cranberries in [Music] [Applause] [Music] wow the smell of that caramel is amazing now cranberries in [Music] crammies are very tired and acidic but balanced with the sweetness of the caramel and apples they give the sauce a lovely dry sharp note to tell if they're fresh drop them on a hard surface the higher they bounce the fresher they are the secret now is sort of caramel to blister the cranberries and really start to break that down smells fantastic next core peel and thinly slice two apples and once this sauce is finished it really does help to sort of wake up the flavor of the turkey now the cranberries are starting to break down apple in smells fantastic a touch of salt and pepper that's really important really helps to balance that tartness against the acidity of the apple salt pepper really brings it back the smell is fantastic it's a sort of sweet sour spicy nice now from there delays the pan with a touch of port around the side deglazing dissolves all the lovely sticky caramelised bits of food that are stuck to the pan and incorporates them into the sauce next add the zest of an orange and for another layer of fragrant sweetness squeezing the juice lovely then cook on a low heat for five to ten minutes to thicken but remember the sauce will become even thicker once it's cooled down now that is the right texture i don't want a runny sauce i want something really nice and thick delicious packed full of flavor perfect if you really want to get ahead this sauce can be made three or four days in advance and kept in the fridge which allows the flavors to develop even more [Music] another job done leaving you more time to enjoy this very special day [Music] and brussels sprouts are delicious when they cook perfectly packed with texture and the flavor is extraordinary take off the outer leaves trim the bottom and cut in half that's a big step up from the crisscross on the bottom that my mother used to do every christmas i'm cutting them in half so when i soda them they cook evenly and look it's like little baby cabbages it's so compact then blanch them in salted boiling water for two minutes now this is the most amazing pancetta lightly cured pancetta is a type of italian bacon which is brilliant for adding a lovely rich meaty flavor to dishes i want a really nice robust flavor to go with that earthy texture of the sprout it's made from pork belly and is dry cured with salt and aromatics like juniper bay leaves nutmeg dry thyme and garlic as it hits the pan that fat on top of the pancetta melts and gives the sprouts this amazing flavor after removing the skin cut into small chunks if you can't get hold of pancetta smoked streaky bacon is a good alternative now hot pan a teaspoon of olive oil [Music] give it a nice seasoning with salt and pepper as the lavender start to crisp up take your sprouts out drain them [Music] sprouts in now give that a really nice little toss then chop up a handful of chestnuts now the chestnut has sweetened the flavor of the sprout really important that you don't put the chestnuts in too early otherwise they'll go mush and then just sprinkle the chestnuts over lovely so we've managed to turn a sort of plain jane sprout into something quite delicious you've got the texture of the smoked bacon the sauteed sprout and that nice crunch and sweetness of the festive chestnut ten seconds before they come out lemon zest over now that makes the sprouts and the bacon harmonize and then just to squeeze our fresh lemon juice over the sprouts beautiful this right now is the ultimate and for me that's a really nice modern 21st century approach to cooking an old-fashioned vegetable you

thing that i remember as a kid was and beans so this is like a little rendition except we're using the most amazing pancetta ernie come on disappear go and chase some mice now panel get nice and hot i'm gonna turn these beans into glamorous beans pancetta into the pan lightly season that it's cured so it doesn't need that much seasoning now start frying off that pancetta it's amazing how the individual tastes of baked beans they're somewhat bland so i always like to make them a little bit more spicy so a nice finely chopped chili with the seeds chili in now a little bit of garlic crushed phenomenal [Music] get that bacon really nice and crispy fry off the chili and the garlic and then onions my top tip for dicing finely sliced downwards slice across and then cut down to simply dice bacon onion chilli garlic that flavor all contained in that little pan once you've sweated the onion off a little bit of sugar in there the brown sugar will start to caramelize darken and enrich as well at the same time that looks beautiful now a couple of tablespoons of cider vinegar delays the pan it's got that really nice powerful kick to it now spice that up with one of my favorite seasonings worcester sauce bring that to the boil and add your passata puree tomatoes turn that down simmer the sauce to reduce then add in the classic baked bean harrico beans you can buy haircut beans dried or canned they are packed with protein and have a lovely soft texture turn down the heat and let the beans absorb all that beautiful spicy tomato sauce and just let that simmer now five or six minutes now for my potato cakes they're a fantastic way to use leftover boiled potatoes and are so easy to make i'm making a simple potato dough by adding flour and butter to the mash that gives it that nice sort of cakey texture and it goes from this leftover ball potato to this nice light flowery potato heaven take a nice spoon of potato lightly flour your board we're gonna fry these crisp on the outside and just nice and fluffy in the center now get your pan nice and hot we'll start off with olive oil into the pan now put the butter around the outside because it starts heating up by the time it goes into the center it's almost sort of nut brown gently turn them over love that nice light crisp they look beautiful now take them out potato cake in the middle and a nice beautiful spoon of beans growing up with beans on toast as a treat still to this day after all those years has not changed my love or attitude for beans especially cooked like that [Music] my smoky spicy homemade baked beans with light and creamy potato cakes comfort and satisfaction on a plate [Music] family favorite boiled eggs with a soldier that will make your taste buds stand to attention there's something quite nostalgic about a bald egg it's something that's never lost it's magic when you slice that top off and dunk that soldier into the yolk you can't mess with a deliciously runny yolk but this is what i like to dunk in it an anchovy soldier anchovies interpersonal water no salt naturally yeah anchovies are very salty so just a touch of pepper rich in omega-3s the amazing tinned anchovy is a natural flavor enhancer and i use it to pepper many a savory dish from roast lamb to the humble toasted soldier grind them to a really nice smooth paste the smell of that is almost like being at the seaside now get your soft butter and just put half the butter in first 50 50 is the way 50 percent anchovy pretend butter that way got that real nice salty creaminess mix that up that's absolutely delicious trust me finishing that anchovy butter on a slice of grilled fish i'm in heaven the bread this is a sourdough delicious very crusty take four nice slices now get that pan nice and hot a couple of tablespoons of that anchovy oil into the pan and then get your bread and lightly fry each side the smell the anchovy oil is incredible take that out now bring your water up to the boil the secret of softly boiling an egg is to place them into the water gently on a spoon in and just tilt so they don't hit the bottom nice and light up to the ball count to five turn the gas down is it four and a half minutes is it five minutes for a softball day i've cooked thousands of them and every time it's four and a half minutes whilst that's boiling get your bread and spread that on there that is incredible chopped parsley brings that kind of freshness goes brilliantly well with the anchovies hear that crunch on i'm sorry but i can't resist oh my god right gas off one beauty in two i feel like a five-year-old again this is that moment when you open the vault and that little magic inside is all yours there's a great twist on a great classic wow [Music] perfectly soft boiled eggs with dressed up anchovy butter soldiers who would have thought that egg and soldiers could be that delicious [Music] eggs bait in hash browns the secret of a great hash brown are the potatoes i prefer using really nice waxy potatoes they cook better but more importantly hold themselves together we're not gonna slice the onion all the potatoes but we're actually gonna grate them the potatoes get really nice and crispy i mean seriously crispy now the onion that way you get that nice balance of the onion flavor running through every little shard of potato [Music] season with salt pepper olive oil and km give that a really good mix through and then squeeze all that water out and look at all that juice we squeeze out there really important the more liquid you remove the crispier your hash browns will be nice large pan put that on once the pan is hot pour in a good glug of olive oil [Music] that sound confirms how important it is to have your pan nice and hot so it seals the grated potato onion together so take the spoon and just pat it down what we're trying to do now is get it really nice and compact going around the outside of the pan with little flecks of butter you just slip them down the back gently and that gets the onions caramelised here's a great tip for turning your hash browns over quick and easy take a plate place it on top and just flip it over and then slide it back in very quickly you see the color we've got on there now got that nice crispy texture of the potato i'm going to use the hash brown as a bed for my baked eggs crack in your eggs nice and gently just a little sprinkling of the cayenne to make the eggs a little bit spicy then into a preheated oven for six to eight minutes meanwhile onto my bacon and i'm giving it a classic american twist now one thing i could never get my head around when i first started eating lots of american breakfast was the sweetness from the bacon i've grown up to love that combination of smoky sweet flavors and it's so easy pan on and simply heat olive oil brown sugar salt and pepper and butter bacon in and as it cooks it becomes irresistibly caramelized and golden brown toffee gas and my glazed bacon absolutely ready beautiful now my hash browns and baked eggs are ready wow look at that beautiful just put your spatula underneath there onto your plate and that bacon sets beauty on top of the baked eggs and that hash brown underneath and you can see why the best breakfasts in the world are always in america this is an all-american superhero offer breakfast eggs bait in hash browns with glazed bacon

removes the stress from cooking and is a pleasure to make chili beef lettuce wraps cooking should never be a chore the more you cook the more confident you become that way you actually start to enjoy it and that's the key to good cooking have a bit of fun along the way this is minced beef and minced pork the pork needs to sit in there otherwise the beef's gonna dry out it's really important to season the mince before you cook it pan nice and hot a touch of olive oil mince in breaking up like that really helps to sort of separate it so we can fry it off with a lot of color with your spoon just go through and start breaking that up the most important thing to remember is mint is made up of cheap cuts brisket belly short rib so it needs help and frying off the mince for color it's so important if this pan wasn't hot your mince is going to boil it's a horrible gray color on there and there's no flavor on your mince taste a little bit [Music] tastes delicious it's seasoned beautifully see how crispy it's going take it much further than you ever taken mince before nice and crispy smells incredible i'm draining it it's crucial it keeps the mints nice and crispy and you get rid of that excess fat that's lovely now just wipe out the pan then wash it low gas now we're going to add texture to the mince finely chopped chili ginger garlic and spring onions spring onions give this sort of mince a really nice freshness because it just gives that crunch nice and thinly now i'm gonna fry off the chilis the ginger the garlic first sesame seed oil teaspoon only in garlic chili ginger in fry that off nicely the sesame seed oil just lifts up the whole flavour brown sugar that starts to really caramelize the chili the garlic and the ginger mince in now my fish sauce that gives it the saltiness you can see now why it's so important to get that mince really crispy because nothing's going soggy staying really crispy fresh lime that makes the mince fragrant and then lime juice roll it and squeeze that in there [Music] incredible i've got the salty i've got the heat i've got the sweetness now i've got the acidicness as well and then finally my spring onions in right at the last minute so i've got crunch in there as well smells amazing literally cook the mince now with sort of 30 seconds to go off and take it out looks incredible smells so inviting [Music] to go with the chili beef i'm making a simple sweet and spicy dipping sauce so everyone can dress the crispy mince to their own taste dipping sauce a little teaspoon the brown sugar soy sauce gives it a nice sort of dark rich color sesame seed oil a tablespoon and just top that up with a tablespoon of olive oil that stops the sesame seed all becoming too rich a teaspoon of fish sauce and then a touch of chili leave the seeds in again i want the heat in that sauce so impressive an amazing show off center piece lime juice in in the coriander chop it through once give that little mix up just check the seasoning that's lovely nice and rich now the lettuce i'm going to use baby gem because it's really nice and durable and sort of quite strong so you just sort of sit these nice trimmed lettuce leaves around now the exciting part to serve take your lettuce up spoon in your mince and then a little touch of dressing just a little drizzle nice and that's the secret of having good easy relaxed food is that you just help yourself food that looks and tastes a million bucks doesn't have to be complex this dish is as fun to cook as it is to eat [Music] first get prepped chopped garlic ginger and chili keeping the seeds for extra kick slice spring onions chopped spring greens and trim ahead of broccoli then whisk two eggs prep done stir fry on add a good lug of oil to a hot pan garlic ginger chili next the spring greens and broccoli add water to steam [Music] then cook rice this dish is perfect for using leftover rice make a well add the eggs spring onions and a dash of fish sauce [Music] scramble then mix season [Applause] top with lime and spring onions [Music] my fragrant fried rice made simple with advanced prep and ready in five minutes this fantastic fast and simple pasta dish made with everyday ingredients just goes to prove you can eat good food whenever you want really important put the water on first so you can just have it gently simmering away ready for the pasta while the water comes to the boil start the sauce by slicing mushrooms first off fingers one in front two behind up and down then add olive oil to a hot frying pan [Music] i want that nice color on the mushrooms off the heat literally 10 seconds and when you toss something really important you get all the ingredients at the end of the pan push down and pull back that noise that's that's all the water coming out of the mushrooms next finely chop a fat clove of garlic [Music] then prepare your leeks just take your knife and go down through the center turn it over and again into quarters see all that opening up and then just rinse the top of that to get rid of any potential dirt or sand it just breaks up into nice little quarters add all that leek into those mushrooms beautiful and now the secret is to get rid of that water inside the leek as it cooks down all the water's gone you just let that really nice intense flavor garlic's got nice and crispy now we're going to add a touch of chicken stock in there beautiful lasagna sheets i'm just going to drop the sheets in to the water lasagna sheets are an unusual choice for a dish like this but they work brilliantly although any type of pasta you've got in the cupboard will do and just twist that pan that stops any pasta actually sticking to the bottom of the pan chicken start to reduce down by half and it's almost delayed the bottom of the pan basically washed all that wonderful flavor off turn the gas down and add a couple of tablespoons of cream this just enriches the dish bring it back up to the ball and let it simmer for three to four minutes now the secret with the pasta is just taking it out a little early so you've got that nice texture hold up the sheet and just nip it and you can feel your fingers in the center it's ready turn the sauce down and lay these beautiful sheets of lasagna into that sauce i'm just going to turn the gas off now and let the pasta sit in there and absorb that amazing sauce finish with chopped fresh tarragon it's a delicious herb it goes brilliantly well mushrooms and leeks just let that sit and almost sort of infuse to serve i'm making a quick bruschetta by toasting fresh chipata bread two nice slices drizzle that in olive oil a little bit of garlic just rub the bread the crust as well crust is what really takes that garlic now pan for the bread a little touch of olive oil as it starts to smoke bread in [Music] but look at the pasta now it's been stained by that amazing sauce to serve i want a nice spoon of my mushrooms leeks and cream then i'll take my pasta just twist it and let it sit on top that tarragon has just lifted everything bread on and that's the beauty about something so simple that can be done in 20 minutes with everyday ingredients a stunning pasta dish adding easy and versatile dishes like this to your repertoire is what cooking at home is all about so you can always make great tasting food at the drop of a hat it's brilliant to have a number of great recipes up your sleeve to rely on and let's be honest we've all got a tin of sweetcorn somewhere so i'm going to show you how to make the most amazing fritter [Music] first off the mixture take your flour sieve really important to sieve the flour that stops the mixture from having any lumps in there just before you get to the end i want to put half a teaspoon of baking powder the baking powder gives the mixture some lift in and just sieve that through a touch of salt and pepper next an egg about four tablespoons of milk and give that a little whisk now just put a little drizzle of olive oil in there that helps to relax the mixture whisk that in make sure we got rid of all those lumps so that i want a nice smooth almost like a cake mixture okay next take the seeds out of a chili to lower the heat roll the chilli so give it a really good shake [Music] tap them out slice in half into quarter and each quarter in half and chop through it's a really nice quick way of slicing a chili into the mixture spring onion take off that outside layer of the spring onion top and tail slice it in an angle it's a little bit of texture running through the mixture i want

beautiful big flat cap mushrooms onions a beautiful coltan battered blue cheese lettuce and a little bit of peppery watercress mustard tabasco lean pearing mustard and a beautiful loaf of bread right let's have 10 minutes on the clock please now first thing you want to slice this big slipper into half okay now i like using the chapata bread i like to sort of douse it in some extra virgin olive oil i like to season it nicely inside but watch salt pepper generously okay a touch of chili flake on there generously and then look get that on the grill okay now get something heavy a plate on there and just push that down that's going to get you a really nice crisp beautiful amazing color on there now the steak usually season it okay really important because sometimes you think there's a lot of salt to the naked eye but it's not because we lose 30 of it the minute it hits the grill get that out of the fridge at least three or four minutes before you're going to cook it it's got very little fat but it is quite fibrous okay so you need to be super careful of not overcooking it the secret of a good steak like that is letting it rest okay let's just check our bread i want a really nice color on there and open that up that's what i want and those chilies are doing their magic push it down okay the bread will bounce back up but get those marks on that bread it will make a huge difference now off goes one okay beautiful off goes the second one now we go on with our steak okay let's get the hottest part on again roll it around that marinade and get it on there so bread's working steak is cooking don't keep on flipping the steak leave it on there okay now let's start thinking about the garnish i love these big flat cap mushrooms i love them take off the stalks mush them on okay they'll break down they'll start cooking literally in seconds a nice season on those mushrooms okay think of the way we're laying this up okay i've got my steak i've got my mushrooms onions this time go about a centimeter thick and start slicing some beautiful onion rings but don't worry about opening them up just get them on there okay and start grill them hold like that they'll break up but again from there a little touch of seasoning okay now i want to talk to you about the sort of the sauce how do we come together with this flavor i've got some mustard tabasco and liam perry it's a wonderful combination turn that steak over look at that color it's exactly what we want beautifully done mushrooms turn them over and then when it comes to the onions a little bit smaller a little bit fiddlier doesn't matter on there and on and you can see those colors now from there take your worcester sauce a couple of tablespoons in there first your tabasco first off painted brush and just start glazing that steak okay as we start to cook the flavor and the smell in here is incredible it's almost like a little varnish okay over the onions as well now all that flavor from the steak is coming out it's running into the mushrooms it's running into the onions and it is absolutely delicious now from there take two nice teaspoons of mayonnaise in two nice teaspoons of mayonnaise one nice teaspoon of dijon mustard generously done a tablespoon of lemon perrin and give that a really nice mix this is our lining for the bread okay little taste a touch of spice a little bit more with the tabasco i like it quite sort of hot so that's incredibly rich for the steak salt pepper and that's gonna be my dipping sauce okay dipping sauce and sauce is gonna be on top of that bread time please halfway now sauce goes in okay look at that beautifully done the secret behind making a great steak sandwich is getting organized and this is how i get organized i dress everything first so first off one spoon all the way down okay start laying this beauty up now from there open up my lettuce snap the lettuce and slice that in half okay snap it and slice it in half and then gonna dust that with my peppery watercress okay and then from there lightly season that in there really important salt and pepper and then look get your dipping sauce and just throw that over okay now think of the layers we've got okay so beautiful let that sit it's all in the build-up and if you can build and cook at the same time even better now look the mushrooms are coming down beautifully the onions are caramelized so once that steak is cooked okay there's a nice surprise to this and think of the combination guinness mistakes like tomato and basil just flood that grill with a touch of guinness and just let that guinness literally absorb through those mushrooms through those onions and through that steak and look what i'm gonna do now is roll that steak over that guinness and that caramelizes beautifully and the flavor of that is just incredible now look the guinness evaporates the alcohol is burnt off but the flavor is incredible off with the gas just leave that sitting there okay now we're gonna start building this up i take my onions off the grill and i dot them over that beautiful salad the secret behind any great steak sandwich is in the build okay look at that my mushrooms come off and they sit on top the smell of that guinness it's beautiful and then there now for the steak time please two minutes now for the steak look at that i'm going to slice this on the bias down not too thin not too thick and look color there once that's sliced lift that up and then sit that on top and get that on there i'm happy for it to sort of bleed and those juices to run through that steak sandwich next one off again on a bias again that guinness is delicious the flavor is unreal sit that on top be generous with that okay you can't stick a whole steak in there slice it and let it go now before we close that over season it lightly touch the salt touch the pepper and then your dipping sauce one more time over she goes beginning smells delicious and then finally turn that round look at that and finally it's beautiful age still and sit that on if you can get that on whilst the steak is nice and hot it helps melt the cheese but sort of hide it okay a little bit sort of mischief with it stick it underneath stick it on the side and just sort of sit it crumble it on top of that hot stake and that's going to lift that to another level and then say goodbye because you stick that on top of there you get your knife you slice that bad boy and trust me you open that up take a bite and you're ready to die and there you go a delicious steak and guinness sandwich to all of you thank you for

american cousins and used for incredible delicates like pastrami and succulent salt beef the key to beef brisket is to cook it low and slow to make it tender and i've got a delicious barbecue style recipe for dinner [Music] we're creating bbq style beef brisket with crunchy coleslaw and sweet potato wedges which will be right up her street holly now you love barbecues right so you're gonna help me barbecue this delicious piece of brisket brisket look at it beautiful it's a very tough cut of meat so it needs to be cooked slowly so it gets really nice and tender are we barbecuing it outside we're gonna actually put the barbecue flavor on there but we're gonna cook it in the oven okay so mustard powder okay here we have some celery seed next a little bit of salt in there okay what's this here cumin two again nice good now this one cayenne pepper absolutely right right two teaspoons of that in there as well good now what i want you to do fresh pepper on there i'll give that a little

girl now that's nice and coated okay in the spice so gas on roasting tray on what we've got to do now with all those spices is sear them in a couple of tablespoons of olive oil into the tray well done okay good that's getting nice and hot now you get your brisket and all that spice lay that in there nicely okay so now we'll start coloring it as you start to sear in you smell those spices yep all

dad so the brown sugar we're gonna start caramelizing the onions right from there my bay leaves in please good girl oh yes please right you want to take over good careful that tray is very very hot a tablespoon of tomato puree roast that off at the bottom of the tray and really rub it in amongst the onions good girl now look at the colors onions right now time for a little drink for the brisket okay one bottle of earring please so you go in you put yours in there i'll put mine here god uh good health to you and your brisket good health bring that to the ball okay now this is where it gets really exciting i want you to lift the brisket up and put it on top of the onions in she goes good girl and then i want you to pour the stock all the way around please i'm using beef stock but it will work with chicken stock or even vegetable stock once the stock has come to the boil cover tightly with foil you just pinch in the ends flatten that down and then you just twist all the way so that's nice and tight that's the hard work done thank you simply pop it in the oven for three and a half hours and as it cooks you can get on with the side dishes first job sweet potato wedges with some serious flavor start by making a spice mix in a dry pan toast coriander seeds until beautifully aromatic then put them in a pestle and mortar add salt and grind [Music] next smoked paprika dried oregano cayenne pepper and mix spice mix done now simply cut your sweet potatoes into wedges toss in olive oil and thoroughly cover with the spice mix onto a baking tray and into a preheated oven for 30 minutes turning halfway irresistible sweet potato wedgies are ready now to finish off my beef see that smell just sort of travels everywhere oh now look at that so we can leave that to rest what does resting mean resting means where you've cooked a joint and you just leave it to relax so it'll make the meat so much more tender okay right coleslaw traditionally you would mix slaw with what mayonnaise that's right mayonnaise this time we're gonna do it a little different so i'd like you to put the yogurt into the bowl for me please all of it i'll start slicing the white cabbage and the red cabbage now from there a nice tablespoon of mustard in there please give that a nice mix up nice little touch of salt and pepper okay now a little cider vinegar so a little splash of cider vinegar in there okay as i shred this okay i'd like you please then to get the red cabbage and just open up into that and mix in at the same time and then you fold that in there as i start shredding see how it's coming together yeah right that's all the red cabbage now the white so you've got that nice vinegary tartness to the slaw and the yogurt keeps it nice and fresh last little bit in one more little thing so put some nice chopped fresh chives in there and that will give it this nice light onion flavor so chives in [Music] how's that now taste it with the chives in there delicious so i would like you to fill up the bowl i'm going to very carefully lift out my brisket how come is it shrunk it's been in the oven for nearly three and a half hours so it's been cooked slowly that sits on there oh

before anybody that is so good that tastes delicious see all that wonderful flavor in there last job is to create an incredibly quick and delicious sauce gas on and reduce the spicy juices and onions the beef cooked in then add in cider vinegar and you've got a brilliant tangy barbecue sauce that smells nice doesn't it wow that is brisket and a half now the rest of it can go in the gravy pot

Pre-order...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, a great tasting salad starts with fantastic salad leaves and when it comes to all things green there's little dr steve rothol doesn't know i think i am obsessed with salad i'm obsessed primarily with watercress that that's in my heart because you know i've got a phd in watercress a doctorate in salad we should all take a leaf out of his book then he's not only been studying salad leaves for over 30 years he's been growing them so he really knows he's rocket from his romaine there are literally thousands of varieties of salad things like batavian lettuce red veined spinach wild rocket sorrel we grow virtually everything outdoors and and we follow the seasons so we're not forcing the leaves we don't give them too much fertilizer or irrigation we try to grow them a little bit slower and that's the way to get the best flavor and the best quality of leaf we'll harvest the crop cut it in the morning and it's then on the road going out to customers to be on the shelf the next day this is a great leaf baby leaf spinach and we call it baby leaf yeah quite literally because we cut it when it's still at a baby stage these are baby pea shoots we'll put something like three or four hundred pea seeds into the seed bed and then in as little as 12 14 days they've grown to a sort of a crop like this they've got the flavor of fresh peas a bit of sweetness and they've got a really nice soft velvety leaf texture this is baby watercress which is my favorite salad crop of them all watercress is special because by definition it's grown in pure flowing water fresh watercress has got that fantastic pungent peppery flavour in victorian london it was known as poor man's bread whereby a lot of workers would start the day with a watercress sandwich and if they couldn't afford bread they just ate the watercress straight it is amazing full of flavor i can't eat enough salad obsessed steve's spot on there's hundreds of salad leaves available with different textures tastes and colors here are five my favorite everyday salad leaves and don't forget some of them are delicious cooked too little gem sweet and crisp and an amazingly dense heart these mini cos lettuces are great simply braised in the oven or use the leaves as scoops for a delicious chili beef filling [Music] mustard leaves pungent spicy and full of vitamin c these are a staple in asian dishes and are fantastic stir-fried or steamed lambs leaf full of tangy flavour and with incredible springy stems great for hearty robust salads or simply paired with fish for a healthier simple supper rocket these distinctive peppery leaves are actually classed as a herb and are perfect in soups or with fruits and are full of iron finely chicory or endive these tightly packed red and white leaves have a deliciously bitter taste and are great wrapped in ham or alongside sharp blue cheeses i think when you're shopping for salads you can just shop with your eyes if it looks fresh and healthy tasty it is you want to look for bright colors i like to see leaves with a bit of moisture on them sounds like to be kept cold and moist basically so when you buy a pack of salad put it in the fridge and if you don't use it all in one go roll up the bag to exclude surplus air put it back in the fridge keep it cold there's so much choice variety out there i really do think people should be more adventurous in their choice of salads here both what they choose to try and eat and and what they do with them so get yourself some ingredients use them boldly and your studded leaves can really take center stage green papaya salad this is a great salad to serve at a party it's delicious and robust enough to last the whole evening without wilting first off these are a little dried shrimp you can buy them anywhere they smell almost sort of of the seabed into the pestle mulch for this salad inspired by my travels across thailand i'm starting by making a wonderfully spicy paste a little salt in there in just break them up this paste is like a staple ingredient in thailand that's what we're looking for almost it's like a powder right next just one clove of garlic slice up the garlic and get that into the pest and water bird's eye chili incredibly hot powerful but wow it does give an amazing kick to the paste in to the mix now a couple of tablespoons of brown caster sugar that softens the blow with a chilli and then just to give that nice sour taste a little bit of hot water into this tamarind paste it's really tart but sweet paste one tablespoon in fish sauce now it's got that almost sort of pickly smell slightly salty but the flavor is intense two tablespoons in bring that together and give it a really good mix some lime juice in half another touch of tartness the paste is nice and thick and fragrant but it's got the heat the sourness the tartness incredible green papaya stand it up give it a little peel you can find green papaya and local asian shops and bigger supermarkets and as it doesn't weld like more delicate veg it's perfect for robust salads like this i grate it look that's what i want these thin slithers next a nice rich sweet banana shalom [Music] nice some carrot carrot gives it another texture now little that and mix it [Music] finish that off with thai basil and fresh coriander thai basil is a much more fragrant basil it's stronger and it's slightly thicker as well like papaya and tamarind paste you can get thai basil in good supermarkets and independent asian stores but normal basil works well too next prepare the crunchy topping pan on and toast some peanuts chop the nuts but it gives a really nice crunch in they go roll them around the pan gas off and just stick them out now for the exciting palm i'm gonna dress the salad nice spoon of dressing in to the papaya mix that in and then finally a nice general sprinkling roasted nuts and that is one delicious very fragrant very robust

beans to salted boiling water and cook for just a couple of minutes this is called blanching and keeps the beans deliciously crunchy [Music] strain the beans and refresh in cold water this stops the

with delicious roasty tomatoes and creamy goats curd now polenta to the italians is what mashed potatoes to britain's a staple incredibly delicious and really straightforward to do now season the water just a little touch of olive oil stops it from becoming too sticky i love polenta it's a cornmeal made from ground dried maize the more coarse the longer it takes to cook but you can also buy instant polenta which is ready in under 10 minutes and always use this at home and then whisk that out as it cooks out it naturally thickens you see the grains becoming almost into one nice fine pureed polenta to take the polenta to another level flavor-wise season with salt and pepper a good knob of butter and parmesan quite generous with the parmesan because polenta can be quite dull i like it quite rich and creamy delicious now mix that in smell a nice smooth shiny glossy planter you can eat polenta two ways like this it's a glorious fluffy mash or set then griddled which is what i'm doing start by oiling a baking tray pour in your polenta now get that in the fridge and let it set next i'm roasting fine tomatoes to really intensify their flavour olive on the bottom of the tray and drizzle extra virgin olive oil on top nip your tomatoes with your scissors if you didn't burst them before they went in the oven they'd explode salt and pepper garlic just squeeze the juice out the garlic so as the tomatoes blister and roast it's going gonna take on all this lovely garlic to give the tomatoes a wonderful sweet and sour flavor a pinch of sugar and balsamic vinegar this is a wonderful aged balsamic vinegar and then some thyme don't pick the time just try it like you're having a little haircut nice the tomatoes only take 10 minutes to roast now the plant is set it's ready to griddle it should just fall out beautiful polenta is a nice garnish for grilled meats it's great when you're planning a big dinner party the polenta can be done one or two days before a nice season top and bottom a nice sort of coating of olive oil and then onto your grill now this looks very impressive but it's so easy to do get that grill really nice and hot make sure you've got a fish slice and go underneath to turn all that nice sort of marking and char in the blender gives that really nice flavor now tomatoes look you got these beautiful vine tomatoes have been roasted and all that wonderful flavor [Music] now get your little tomatoes and just sit them on top drizzle over any remaining roasting juices the perfect addition is a goat's curd goat's curd gives it that nice sort of salty creamy taste goat's cheese cream cheese or creme fraiche will work just as well drizzle a little touch of that aged barcelona vinegar and then a little basil i can't wait to dive in this dish is fantastic when you're entertaining in the morning set your plenty the night before and you can have this casual brunch on the table within minutes fuss-free cooking that looks like a labor of love roasted tomato soup beautiful vine tomatoes the ripe of the tomatoes the better the soup take the core out get your thumb and place it half a centimetre underneath the tip of your knife place it in and then just twist round that's the only part of the tomato that we're not using red onion and garlic red onion because it's sweeter than a white onion slice your onions and your garlic it's nice and fine traditionally you'd be making it in a pot it's so much better to start it off on top of the stove the searing the tomatoes and the garlic when it goes in the oven you actually roast the tomatoes and they don't stew there's a big difference in flavor be quite generous with the olive oil it makes the soup nice and glossy shiny salt pepper and then a little teaspoon of cayenne just gives it that heat but it's not as fierce as chilli take your tomatoes and just slice them in half and then a little touch of sugar that's going to help intensify the sweetness a little sprinkle of aged bottled vinegar it gives that nice dark rich acidity to the soup into the oven 20 25 minutes 180. to make my soup even more irresistible i'm going to make a punchy sun-dried tomato pesto to drizzle over the top now i'm making this in a pestle and mortar because you feel so much more in control and you're not depending on a blade that's whizzing around at a thousand miles an hour next in a dry pan toast off some pine nuts toast them the absolute max and then in the smell in there is incredible parmesan lightly grate that this is where it starts to become creamy next virgin olive oil doesn't need salt because the is going to season it for you and just take a couple tablespoons of the oil that the sun-dried tomatoes are in really helps to make that stunning pesto i can smell those roasted tomatoes want them out wow next pour in a little vegetable stock or chicken stock so it sits halfway up the tomatoes put your spoon through those tomatoes they break up instantly bring that up to the boil let it simmer for three or four minutes i want to make it a little bit more creamy now cream in give that a little stir you can keep it rustic and you get your masher in and you've got that nice thick rich chunky tomato soup or get yourself a stick blender blitzing it like that you delays the bottom of the pan and you get all those amazing flavors from the bottom that's delicious to make my lunch extra hearty i'm gonna knock up a deliciously gutsy version of cheese on toast to go with my tomato soup boss rabbit an absolute classic i'm gonna make a roux 50 grams of butter three nice tablespoons of flour and that's all there is basically traditionally you would use flour butter and milk but in welsh rabbit the milk is often cheekily substituted for a stiff slug of stout gives it that strong gutsy flavor i want it nice and thick make sure those lumps are out a nice teaspoon of dijon mustard and then season it nice and spicy moisture sauce gives it that delicious intriguing flavor now that smells amazing almost brings tears to your eyes beautiful now boss rabbit wouldn't be a stunning welsh rabbit without rich mature cheese soap and a great montgomery cheddar goes well with a beer and drop that in really important to put this in while the roux is still nice and hot because the cheese melts now for the bread i prefer a good rustic country loaf that will stand up to my hardcore topping i want that nice crisp base to my welsh rabbit so toast it both sides [Music] spread that beautiful cheesy berry spicy mixture just great got a blister and bubble and gratinate god a little splash alien perry and back under the grill for 90 seconds in one delicious creamy roasted tomato soup it's coming back to me all those days i had off school i used to purposely lie about feeling ill just to get a bowl of my mother's tomato soup how bad was that but my god it was worth it oh now oh i'll show you [Music] look at those babies that just takes cheese on toast to another level wow roasted creamy tomato soup with a sun-dried tomato pesto served with the most amazing delicious welsh rabbit i feel like bringing in sick [Music] a delicious saffron flatbread with mussels it doesn't get any healthier than that first job the super easy saffron flatbread [Music] put the saffron into the bowl and a couple of teaspoons of hot water that starts to infuse the saffron and so you can maximize on the colour across your flatbeds to make the dough simply add plain flour a pinch of salt and pepper to a bowl and then pour in a dash of olive oil that makes the dough nice and silky and rich your saffron water you'll see how concentrated it is now and you'll need cold water then simply need to bring the dough together mop up all your flour you can see now the saffron's activated it's got that really nice color beautiful use your wrist and just knead it nicely we'll do now is smoothing out the gluten strands push and tuck in push and tuck in and each every time you do this getting softer you just sort of form like this perfect beautiful dough it smells delicious that saffron is very powerful now sit that in your bowl cover it with clim film let it rest for 10 to 15 minutes this relaxes the dough making it easier to roll and gives it time to infuse with the saffron i'm gonna cut that into three and then roll them nice and thinly now lightly flour the surface and then just bring that it's like a perfect ball on the board once you've got that nice ball your rolling pin and just roll it out now it doesn't get any simpler than that and just lightly flour that on top a little salt cooking the flatbread is easy just pop in a hot dry pan and they're ready in minutes as it hits the pan it starts the blister she's ready for turning beautiful get that color on there now you want it nice and crisp almost blistering on both sides because it's nice and thin it's cooked once browned on both sides just cool on a rack flatbread's done now on to the muscles now the secret behind cooking great muscles is in the speed you cook the key is to chop and prep your ingredients before you start cooking first thing pancetta i want it quite chunky if you can't get pancetta i always like to use a sort of streaky bacon because i want to sort of render all that flavor at the streaky bacon now tomatoes garlic and chili cherry tomatoes they're just going in whole the garlic just crush the garlic so all that flavor comes out chilli i want some heat in here that's everything prepped now to get it cooked little touch of olive oil pancetta in pancetta takes moments once it's brown and crisp put your garlic chili and whole cherry tomatoes into the pan mussels go in okay and i'm using dry sherry i think it works better in this recipe than white wine which is classically used at this stage then oregano finely chopped stalks and all i'll go on and then just give that a little mix and we'll see those muscles start to open lid goes on you've got to lock in that flavor gotta lock in that heat the mussels will take four to five minutes to steam in the meantime cut your flatbreads into strips crispy and crunchy now the mussels wow that is incredible my goodness me [Music] now that is one lunch i definitely don't want to miss healthy and delicious doesn't get any better than that incredible steamed mussels with saffron flatbreads made in minutes and packed with protein and vitamins this is one fast food meal that really is healthy you

else you have left for me the secret of a good frittata is in the sausage nice hot pan onions in genus on the onions heat nice and high season fennel seeds to give the onions a really nice flavor everyone's used to cooking sausages whole but it's a really nice way of using them to take them out of their thin skin what we're going to do is crumple all that wonderful spicy fennel sausage into the onions it's going to release all that flavor a lot quicker pretty important to keep that gas nice and high and the longer you caramelise the sausage the more flavor you're going to gain six whole eggs give your eggs a really good mix flat leaf parsley a staple in italian cooking chop it quite rough some parmesan it gives a really nice seasoning fresh pepper a little touch of salt and then get it in there when you fork through it so when you slice it no one's complaining they've got less sausage i'm gonna make it even more italian by topping it with some buffalo mozzarella dry it and then slice it nice and thinly twist it mozzarella in and then finally finish it with that pounds and cheese get the top just as tasty as the bottom my frittata needs three and a half to four minutes under a red hot grill to achieve the best results always ensure your oven or grill are preheated to the perfect temperature she's ready this is the thing i love about italian cooking it's about sharing but always focusing on the ingredients look at that i mean it's incredible a little shake the pan to make sure it comes out and then spatula underneath and just leave it it's light fluffy and it smells incredible and that for me is a dream come true it's amazing how far you can take six eggs and two sausages wow spicy fennel sausage frittata my ultimate italian breakfast it's a cracking start to the day [Music] i go fishing a lot and scotch eggs are the perfect all-in-one mini picnic breakfast first thing get your eggs cooked bring the water up the boil onto the spoon and lower them into the water that way they don't hit the water and crack four and a half minutes that'll keep the center nice and slightly runny now ground sausage meat i'm gonna make mine a little bit spicier i'm gonna crumble in black pudding that helps to season the scotch eggs inside a little touch of salt and pepper and then just to make it a little bit sweeter and a lot easier for the kids to eat some grated apple [Music] combine that blend in the apple and the black pudding eggs once they're cooked drain them and then run them under cold water cracking and cooling the eggs quickly will prevent the yolks turning gray tap them on the side of the pan put them back into the water and what happens the water seeps underneath the shell see the shell come off so much easier eggs still slightly soft in the center i want that little bit of richness with the yolk next you need to get yourself organized with a mini assembly line seasoned flour a little egg wash and breadcrumbs take your mince golf ball size spread the pate manipulate with your thumb and then sit your egg in there and spread the sausage over the egg and you just seal that over really important to keep that nice even coating of sausage meat around the egg you don't want it too thick otherwise it gets too dense and it's unappetizing give them a light dusting in the seasoned flour if you don't put the flour on the egg wash won't stick if you don't put the egg wash on the breadcrumbs won't stick into the egg roll it round shake off any excess egg wash and roll it into your breadcrumbs you can use this same three-stage method to breadcrumb anything you'd like from chicken goujons and fish fillets to fina schnitzel these are panko breadcrumbs japanese white breadcrumb so no crust you can experiment by adding flavors to your breadcrumbs like parmesan herbs or citrus zest i always like to push the actual breadcrumbs into the sausage meat so it gets that really nice golden brown and stops any of the outside burning once breadcrumbed lower the eggs carefully into a four centimeter deep bath of hot vegetable oil for 10 to 12 minutes the eggs are actually cooked soft and running the center so the objective is just to cook the sausage meat and the black pudding they're great don't they go and grenades there's something so magical about a scotch egg on a picnic because it's like this little mini breakfast beautiful drain them onto the paper roll them around just to get off any excess oil and then to transport them some greaseproof paper that for me is the perfect start to the fishing trip there's no wonder i never catch any fish because i'm always too busy eating my scotch eggs [Music] my ultimate black pudding lace scotch eggs an irresistibly delicious picnic breakfast pear and crunchy granola muffins something quite nice when you walk into friends or family's house and you smell a muffin being baked the flour and the baking powder in a nice touch of cinnamon cinnamon muffins goes brilliantly a pinch of salt that's really important for the sort of overall flavor you don't want the muffin to be too sweet muscovado sugar that's a refined brown sugar really rich somewhat spicy and goes brilliantly inside the muffin and then my crispy granola now i'm gonna put half of this in now and save the other half just sprinkle on top of the muffin give that a really good mix in the center i'll have some fresh pear top and tail the pears really important to peel nothing worse when you're trying to enjoy that muffin and you're negotiating with a big sliver of skin of pear slice them round the core four sides and slice it nice and thinly generally muffins contain around half the fat and sugar of cupcakes once the dry ingredients are mixed together you add in the wet two whole eggs nice milk in followed by gently melted butter give that a good mix [Music] add that to your mixture just start folding always do it by hand muffins are delicate dainty little beasts don't overwork your muffin mixture you want that mixture to become nice and relaxed now the mix looks nice and creamy your tray and your little cups and spoon in that mixture two thirds full one nice generous spoon you can tell the mix is right because you've got that even distribution of the pear running from the top to the bottom just gently tap your tray both ends that gets the mix all the way down so they cook nice and evenly take your granola now sprinkle that on top so you got this dual texture spicy pear and this nice crunchy topping makes the muffin taste and feel a little bit more luxurious now into the oven at 180 for 25 minutes beauties [Music] they smell delicious you got that nice crispy top just get them out and let them cool down and i don't have any problems turning vegetarian once or twice a week when i'm having muffins like that nice i smell amazing [Music] a vegetarian breakfast to put hairs on your chest pear and crunchy granola muffins that is a vegetarian delight beautiful eggs bait in hash browns the secret of a great hash brown are the potatoes i prefer using really nice waxy potatoes they cook better but more importantly hold themselves together we're not gonna slice the onion all the potatoes but we're actually gonna grate them the potatoes get really nice and crispy i mean seriously crispy now the onion that way you get that nice balance of the onion flavor running through every little shard of potato [Music] season with salt pepper olive oil and km give that a really good mix through and then squeeze all that water out and look at all that juice we squeeze out there really important the more liquid you remove the crispier your hash browns will be nice large pan put that on once the pan's hot pour in a good glug of olive oil [Music] that sound confirms how important it is to have your pan nice and hot so it seals the grated potato onion together so take the spoon and just pat it down what we're trying to do now is get it really nice and compact going around the outside of the pan with little flecks of butter you just slip them down the back gently and that gets the onions caramelised here's a great tip for turning your hash browns over quick and easy take a plate place it on top and just flip it over and then slide it back in very quickly you see the color we've got on there now you've got that nice crispy texture of the potato i'm going to use the hash brown as a bed for my baked eggs crack in your eggs nice and gently just a little sprinkling of the cayenne to make the eggs a little bit spicy then into a preheated oven for six to eight minutes meanwhile onto my bacon and i'm giving it a classic american twist now one thing i could never get my head around when i first started eating lots of american breakfast was the sweetness from the bacon i've grown up to love that combination of smoky sweet flavors and it's so easy pan on and simply olive oil brown sugar salt and pepper and butter bacon in and as it cooks it becomes irresistibly caramelized and golden brown top of gas and my glazed bacon absolutely ready beautiful now my hash browns and baked eggs are ready wow look at that beautiful just put your spatula underneath there onto your plate and that bacon sets beauty on top of the baked eggs and that hash brown underneath and you can see why the best breakfasts in the world are always in america this is an all-american superhero offer breakfast eggs bait in hash browns with glazed bacon you

smoke there's a big difference see i've got that bright yellow tinge so much better next baby spinach it's a spinach that's very young full of zinc great flavor little teaspoon volleyball knob of butter that little touch of oil stops the butter from burning it looks like a lot of spinach but it's going to disintegrate almost by two thirds i'm cooking spinach in butter i open up the top of my peppermill so the pepper becomes almost like sort of cracked pepper lots of fine once your spinach has reduced down by two thirds add in your cubes of smoked haddock tarragon it's got that nice vinegary flavor quite tart pick off the little buds from the stalks keep hold of these and grateful when you're making a tag and vinegar red wine vinegar tag and stalks in chop your tarragon into your creme fraiche a little seasoning now grain mustard goes brilliantly well with havok incredible this mustardy herbie creme fresh will work equally well partnered with grilled chicken the headache's starting to flake because it's smoked lightly cured it cooks so quickly your creme fraiche it's nice now it's almost like the beginning of the perfect fish pie but as opposed to putting pastry on top the eggs are going to bake on top so you got this wonderful egg crust turn the gas off now crack your eggs around the outside just a little twist of pepper get the remainder of your cream fresh and put a little dollop in between that adds richness to the egg whites into the oven at 180 for 10 to 12 minutes [Music] whilst the haddock and eggs bake together i can knock up a simple spring onion garnish in professional kitchen chefs refuse to use the top of the spring onions but i love that nice dark green flavor it's less harsh than the white the smell of baked mustard you can't beat [Music] that is beautiful spinach was almost melted in with a hat up now just sprinkle your spring onions that gives that really nice sharpness wow my ultimate hearty breakfast smoked haddock and spinach baked eggs so packed with protein and iron you'll be raring to dive into the day ahead [Music] there's something quite nostalgic about a bald egg it's something that's never lost it's magic when you slice that top off and dunk that soldier into the yolk you can't mess with a deliciously runny yolk but this is what i like to dunk in it an anchovy soldier anchovies interpersonal water no salt naturally yeah anchovies are very salty so just a touch of pepper rich in omega-3s the amazing tinned anchovy is a natural flavour enhancer and i use it to pepper many a savory dish from roast lamb to the humble toasted soldier grind them it's a really nice smooth paste the smell of that is almost like being at the seaside now get your soft butter and just put half the butter in first 50 50 is the way 50 percent anchovy 50 butter that way got that real nice salty creaminess mix that up that's absolutely delicious trust me finishing that anchovy butter on a slice of grilled fish i'm in heaven the bread this is a sourdough delicious very crusty take four nice slices now get that pan nice and hot a couple of tablespoons of that anchovy oil into the pan and then get your bread and lightly fry each side the smell of the anchovy oil is incredible take that out now bring your water up to the boil the secret of softly boiling an egg is to place them into the water gently on a spoon in and just tilt so they don't hit the bottom nice and light up to the boil count to five turn the gas down is it four and a half minutes is it five minutes for a softball day i've cooked thousands of them and every time it's four and a half minutes whilst that's boiling get your bread and spread that on there that is incredible chopped parsley brings that kind of freshness goes brilliantly well with the anchovies hear that crunch on inside but i can't resist oh my god right gas off one beauty in two i feel like a five-year-old again this is that moment when you open the vault and that little magic inside is all yours there's a great twist on a great classic wow [Music] perfectly soft boiled eggs with dressed up anchovy butter soldiers who would have thought that egg and soldiers could be that delicious [Music] some of the best food i had in india was street food and every little food stall was cooking up something spicy something delicious a teaspoon of oil gonna toast off a teaspoon of cumin mustard seeds a touch of salt and pepper lightly fry them off it's really important to cook off the spices it intensifies the flavor but really draws out that nice spicy deep rich flavor so onion three fingers one in front two behind nice and fine onions in [Music] now we're gonna caramelize those onions mustard seeds have started to infuse cumin has that nice kick now with a little touch of butter in there get it nice and sort of rich gas up nice and high and really caramelize those onions now once the onions have turned a rich golden color that's what i'm looking for that is beautiful add baby spinach keep that pan nice and hot if you don't cook it out the actual breakfast ends up watering when the spinach is cooked set aside and it's on to the spicy eggs now the breakfast really starts to come alight four nice eggs now give those eggs a little whisk a little touch of butter into the pan a little teaspoon of oil so the butter doesn't burn when the butter and oil are hot add a teaspoon of garam masala and turmeric cook that out now take your eggs into the pan almost gonna make like a really nice spicy scrambled egg turn the gas down now as the scrambled egg comes together just finish that with a little bit of butter i quite like the sort of creaminess makes it so much more delicious and then from there i get my spinach chop up and then fold in the spinach to your scrambled egg something quite exciting about eating spice for breakfast but it's served in these wonderful little thin naan breads this will work with any flatbread or wrap you fancy and then lightly toast your naan take the eggs off the heat whilst you get on with the last job add quick mint and spice yogurt dressing a couple of tablespoons of fresh yogurt in there's always something take out the heat then add chopped mint salt and turmeric mix that in now take a scrambled egg and half fill and now it smells incredible get your yogurt down on top and lift that over and for me that's what really stands out with street food in india how delicious they can make street food with a little bit of spice amazing [Music] once you try this spicy wrap i promise you scrambled eggs will never taste the same spicy mexican eggs this is a very classic mexican style brunch dish bold kick-ass flavors slice the chili seeds in garlic sliced nice and thinly tablespoon of olive oil i'm a big fan of brunches and if you get it right a great brunch can see you right through to dinner now to start the sort of spicy fragrant tomato sauce get your cumin in there garlic chili roasted cumin red onions already sounds mexican once that starts getting really nice and crispy in with your tomatoes never embarrassed using good canned tomatoes i do all the time cooking at home now by reducing that you sort of come down to a delicious paste leave that to simmer next canned beans called black beans these are authentically mexican but cannellini beans or chickpeas will work just fine just rinse some a little bit of water that is beautiful turn off the gas and just let it absorb leaving the dense beans to luxuriate in the spicy tomato sauce will allow them to soften and soak up all the flavor next oil and season an oven-proof dish from my spicy egg brunch to baking i'll just get some of that oil around the outside take your corn tortillas slice them in half and then just stick them to the side these are a staple in mexico take one and place that in the center get your mix and place that on top of the tortilla spread that out nice and smoothly lift up those little flaps i want that crisp shell on the outside now your eggs and cheese get the base of the egg and just make a little hole in there and then crack the egg into there again use a little point put your egg in there one two three four five and one in the middle gently crack and get the egg to sit inside almost like it's a little dug dugout and then one for the center get a really nice rich delicious strong montgomery cheddar i want to grate the tortilla shell as well so get generous with it on the top and we'll season that with these little babies little chili flakes they're my little secret weapon and they're going to spice up that egg just salt a touch of pepper sit that in the oven to bake for 8 to 10 minutes and 180. [Music] [Applause] that smells incredible it's a little bit of coriander to finish it off and that for me is what brunch is all about let's go a fantastic fiery brunch to get your party started spicy mexican eggs and a crispy tortilla shell

If...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, [Music] halloumi is a firm springy salty cheese with his roots firmly in cyprus and grease the betalumi is made from sheep's milk rich in vitamins and essential nutrients is thought to promote longevity halloumi keeps for many months if stored unopened in the fridge and its high melting point makes it brilliantly adaptable perfect for grilling barbecuing and frying i'll be championing this texture lending marvel for my yummy vegetarian lunch dish of halloumi courgette and herb cakes as a chef i'm never sniffy about cooking with vegetables because i know that with a bit of care and attention they can be turned into something absolutely stunning for my ultimate vegetarian lunch i've got a couple of fantastic recipes lightly fried my delicious halloumi and courgette cakes squeeze every last bit of flavor out of those vegetables but first i'm preparing a simple slow roast tomato and watercress salad these cherry tomatoes are perfect if you haven't got cherry tomatoes vitamins are good or even just big normal plump tomatoes lay the tomatoes on the tray and these go into the oven for about 90 minutes if you turn the oven down really low you can leave them in overnight to be honest the longer you leave them the better they taste once you've seasoned them with salt sprinkle over with some sugar and the salt and sugar combine speeds up the drying process because you want that nice chewy texture and then you get these little time flowers and just pick off the buds garlic sliced then just spread that on now the tray looks quite full and compact but 90 minutes in the oven you'll see everything shrink down all the skins blistering and the flavor intensifies so nicely extra virgin olive oil that gives a nice earthy flavor to the tomatoes place your tomatoes into an oven preheated to 150 degrees c and cook long and slow for an hour and a half now halloumi cakes there's something quite exciting about halloumi cheese it's a very firm cheese and it fries brilliantly peel the carrots [Music] great not too finely you want that nice texture next courgette the secret is it all grated the same put that into a sieve [Music] a sprinkling of salt will draw out liquid from the vegetables then grate the halloumi halloumi cheese doesn't look that tasty but once you've got color on it in the pan it's really really delicious now really important to squeeze out the excess water from the veg and we'll see all that water that needs to come out of there if you didn't do this it will make your little patties non-friable because the whole thing starts to separate and then mix in with the cheese spring onions chop up the whites and the greens now we're going to season that with some delicious fresh mint and fresh coriander whenever it's vegetarian i like to put a combination of herbs in there tarragon parsley mint coriander basil and lemongrass all delicious on their own but in tandem their flavors play off each other next two eggs in give that a little mix add the eggs to the mixture and then finally a couple of tablespoons of breadcrumbs the breadcrumbs help dry out any excess moisture mix all the ingredients together before you start shaping these taste the mixture it's really important to identify the seasoning now if you wait until you've cooked them it'll be too late to adjust the seasoning roll them to a large golf ball shake them like a little mini burger you could spice these up with some chili in there if you haven't got fresh chili chili flakes and it's something that can be done up a day in advance to get your cakes firm and ready for frying put them into the fridge uncovered for 25 minutes pan on get that nice and hot whilst i'm waiting for that i'll get the dressing ready slice the red chili seeds and all on an angle into shards then chop fresh ginger season with a sprinkle of sugar and salt add some rice wine vinegar add a couple of tablespoons of olive oil to finish off some chopped coriander [Music] got that sweet sour spicy flavor with my chili dressing done i can start frying off my halloumi cakes in a hot oiled pan we get a nice crisp edge you can already start to smell that sauteed halloumi with the courgettes and carrots smells delicious really important for a nice amount of color on them as my cakes sizzle away i can finish off my roast tomato salad one of my favorite leaves has to be watercress it's cut off stalks [Music] shallot rings watercress and shallot go brilliantly well together the shallot looks so dainty when you open up these little ringlets [Music] don't forget to turn your cakes now tomatoes whatever you don't use just jar them and put them in the fridge [Music] just drop those slow cooked warm tomatoes over the watercress the sweetness is incredible absolutely delicious a little drizzle of age of smoked vinegar gives that tartness to the watercress watercress is naturally peppery so it doesn't need any pepper just a little touch of salt and then a light sprinkling of extra virgin olive oil after five minutes on a medium heat my halloumi cakes are ready so important to have taken out that water [Music] you can see it doesn't disintegrate and then just get your dressing take a spoon of it and then tilt it to the side because i want the garnish i don't want the juice if that does not turn you on to become a vegetarian for the night i honestly don't know what will delicious [Music] my crispy golden halloumi courgette and herb cakes with a sumptuous roast tomato and watercress salad all of the flavor with none of the meat murgues and fontina stuffed croissants okay big and bold i was living in france i stayed there for three years once twice a week i treated myself to the most amazing bold breakfast and it started off with these beauties here murgays cheap but incredibly tasty start off with a nice hot pan mug is in it's a very spicy sausage doesn't need any help doesn't need any chili just a touch of salt and pepper you can smell the spice let's start to release all that wonderful oil that flavor in there add a couple of cloves i'll finely slice garlic spread the garlic across the pan it instantly changes color takes on this nice dark rich golden color now take a look at the heat out with the parsley the stalks of soft herbs like parsley and coriander can be used to impart flavor during cooking but the leaves should always be added just before serving to give maximum color and fragrance [Music] and then finish that off with my capers amazing all right beautiful now take your quests on they're literally 24 hours old so they're crispy on the outside and just slice off the lid this recipe is a great way to use up any leftover croissants from the day before i used to cringe when i saw the french cooks throw away croissants i used to cry thinking oh my god any idea what you're throwing away in terms of flavor whatever you do do not wipe out that pan dunk your croissants mopping up all that amazing flavor and caramelizing the inside for that beautiful and don't forget the lids and then get your thumbs and go inside the croissant all i want to do now is just create a little pocket and just manipulate the crescent now this is where it gets exciting mix up the capers the garlic and sausages look at the color of that wonderful delicious flavoured oil now some cheese but not just any cheese fontina cheese is like the number one cheese for grilling and because it's a very rich cheese you shave it thinner than you would a white truffle but it gives a really nice saltiness and a light smoky flavour salt place these big boys on the tray literally 30 seconds on the grill here we go nice crisp packs full of flavor now top them and that for me it's almost like being back in paris except this time i don't have to share them with the french my ultimate big and bold breakfast murgies and fontina stuffed croissants a great way to start the day spicy black beans with feta and avocado [Music] first in a pan heat olive oil add chopped onion and fry until soft then finely slice garlic and chili add cumin cinnamon and black beans then combine cook together until deliciously soft these small beans come dried or in tins and they're a great cheap ingredient to make dishes more substantial to serve dollop the black bean mixture on crunchy tortillas topped with cubed ripe avocado chopped fresh coriander and crumbled salty feta cheese spicy black beans with feta an avocado a dish has filling frugal and tastes fantastic my next great veg recipe is leaking greer rusty with fried eggs [Music] in a hot pan sweat shredded leeks along with a knob of butter and seasoning next great par ball potatoes and grill a hard swiss cheese with a great nutty flavor then combine with the softened leeks in a pan heat oil and a little butter spoon in the potato leek and cheese mix cook gently until golden and crisp underneath then slide onto a plate flip over and return to the pan to finish cooking [Music] finally for the perfect topping fry two eggs and place them on top of the rosty top with fresh tarragon [Music] leaking grill rusty with fried eggs a simple but substantial dish that makes the most of hearty root veg what could be more classically british than the cheese that's been produced here since the 12th century cheddar originally made in the caves of the cheddar gorge in the west country it's still far and away the uk's cheese of choice in britain cheddar outsells all the other cheeses combined good quality cheddar has an amber yellow hue and it's firm but not greasy or hard a dish becomes a classic because it's delicious and somehow strikes a cord with us it just works sometimes these dishes can become tired but a clever twist helps make them fresh again you can't get more classic than a centuries-old midday meal of bread cheese and beer reinvented and marketed by pubs as a plan was lunch in the 60s i'm now giving it my 21st century take like plum ones with the most amazing but super simple beer baked bread hearty and full of flavor for a really quick and easy bread dough sieve a mix of wholemeal and self-raising white flour with a good pinch of salt salt is really important to breath it's the first thing i do once i've cracked it and smelt you want to smell that salt baked throughout beer in about 250 mils of beer [Music] the reason why this recipe works so well is it the beer it's got that yeast so naturally it's going to work beautifully give that a really good mix i'm looking for the mixture to be quite wet if the dough becomes too firm then it's gonna cook dry in the center just as it starts to fall through the whisk that is perfect beautiful this mix will work really well as one large loaf but i want to make my plum ones a little bit more special small tins give it that kind of intimacy and i quite like having my own little loaf give the molds a really nice lining with butter make sure you butter the top now tablespoon of flour dust inside the mold that will stop your mixture sticking tap out any excess three-quarters fill your little moulds we're gonna allow it to sort of rise just so it comes above the mold and forms this really nice miniature loaf onto the tray centimeter apart into the oven 25 to 30 minutes at 180. something quite nice about the smell of home-baked bread in the kitchen delicious no plan was it's complete without pickled onions red onion is a lot sweeter less harsh than a white onion the early days of plum and you've got those ghastly sharp pickled onions that make you almost cry when you're crunching them i'm gonna lightly pickle my red onion just push your fingers through so you get these nice sort of onion rings a little touch of salt and sprinkle the sugar and then a couple of cloves in there that gives it a really nice sort of perfume and sort of makes the pickling slightly more mellow red wine vinegar now if you haven't got red wine vinegar white wine vinegar it's just as good but red matches the red onion so it goes hand in glove a couple of tablespoons of vinegar just give that a really good mix to speed up the pickling process use a weight to put pressure on the onions as the weight presses down on the onions the clove the salt the sugar the vinegar worked their magic and it comes out with a really nice light fragrant pickle for my 21st century plants i'm creating an all-in-one salad and bringing the traditional elements together with a punchy dressing a tablespoon of english mustard a tablespoon of honey a touch of salt and pepper and finish off with white wine vinegar and olive oil [Music] now generally it's sort of three parts oil to one part vinegar that's the sort of general base [Music] you don't really think of a vinaigrette with a plan ones but this is a really nice sort of modern approach to plan ones for my plan one salad i'm using a mixture of robust and crunchy romaine lettuce and punchy watercress if i was making a watercress soup i'd use the stalks but the stalks are a little bit bitter so i just grab them like that pinch them and then twist [Music] very peppery very hot but so juicy watercress in your celery chop it nice and finely it's the one thing that everybody leaves is that stick of celery so scatter it amongst the salad a bit of oomph and color from some sliced radishes and sweetness from a thinly sliced apple whilst you're busy throwing your plum and salad together do not forget about your beer bread before it comes out i'm gonna glaze the top with a little touch of milk that'll put a really nice finish to the bread back in for the last five minutes now for the magic and the plain ones generally you'll see it as a ham or cheddar or stilton players it's hard to dictate which one's the best so for the ultimate plowman's i'm adding all three with your cheddar peel some nice shards of that delicious creamy cheddar just get them dancing on top the dressing drizzle ran in circles and then finally our delicious lightly pickled onions give them a good squeeze and look just dot the onions around bread it's ready it's got that nice yeasty smell warm crusty and delicious there you go that is my classic modern version of a traditional stunning ploughman's wow [Music] my delicious all-in-one plan one salad with individual beer bread loaves updated for the 21st century [Music]

Gordon Ramsay's Ultimate Fit Food/Healthy, Lean and Fit – http://po.st/REpVfP...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, these delicious spicy pancakes are really great alternative but more importantly so easy to do start off by toasting your cumin [Music] it's a dry roast basically non-stick pan just a touch of seasoning the salt helps to dry out the cumin even more and then fresh ginger slice them nice and thinly stack it back up and then just slice nice little thin slices in there and then keep that bunched up shake the chilli removing the seeds will prevent things getting too hot now garlic nice now add olive oil to your toasted cumin seeds and then with the garlic ginger and chili lovely and it feels strange when you talk about garlic for breakfast but the time i spent in india everybody was eating something savory for breakfast it was extraordinary into your bowl and set aside next the pancake filling add olive oil to a hot pan mustard seeds in now they'll start dancing the minute they hit the pan then finally slice an onion onions in a little teaspoon of turmeric sprinkle that in and look at the color an instant change leftover potatoes just slice them the smell is incredible potatoes in now spread the potatoes across the pan while the potatoes stained i want them sort of absorbing all that really nice turmeric actually like a sponge season those potatoes it really helps to bring out the spice beautifully they're ready turn off the gas and let them sit there and absorb all those flavors back to the pancake batter add plain flour to your cooled garlic chili ginger and cumin seeds a touch of salt and pepper nothing worse than the bland pancake one whole egg milk hold the jug with one hand and whisk we have a secret to get that really nice smooth paste but whisk in that egg first and brings it together and then you're milking don't put all the milk in because then you're gonna get a lumpy pancake mix and if you put less milk in it really helps it not going lumpy look at that milk here and the secret for me is to have a nice thin mix now just a little teaspoon of oil that helps to bring a nice crispy edge to the mixture now just taste that's the texture pan on the larger the pan the better it helps to create a nice thin even surface i want that mix going all the way around the pan before you put the mixture into the pan make sure you give your pancake mix a really nice stir pan it's nice and hot turn down the gas a touch of olive oil in get that nice whisk with one hand pan to the mix in one and a half ladles and then roll it around so it's really nice and thin i want to see the ginger the garlic that's what i'm looking for in there now back onto the heat it only starts to remove from the bottom of the pan and lifts itself up once it's cooked these little bubbles confirm that it's just starting to lift off the pan a little shake that releases it and then just shake it to the end and toss if you haven't got the confidence tossing then use a spatula and turn it over now that's exactly what i want that nice sort of crisp edge around the side the colour on the pancake is so important now roll it round and just let it slide out beautifully now for the exciting part filling them take your potatoes just sort of have a really nice imaginary line and then just very carefully roll that nice and tightly tuck it underneath there pull it back and roll useful the delicious pancakes are ready to eat but with a simple dipping sauce there'll be a real treat just mix chopped coriander with natural yogurt that's really nice cooling asian sit there on the side and that for me is a great brunch delicious spicy pancakes amazing [Music] chicken stir-fry with rice noodles some of the best street food i've ever eaten was in asia every one of those little markets was filled with smells of delicious food that all centered around an asian staple noodles learn to cook those properly and you'll be surprised how quick and easy it is to knock up a delicious dinner first off we're gonna soak our noodles now these are rice noodles into a bowl and just pour the hot water over the rice noodles soak and rehydrate 12 to 15 minutes to soften up if you've got a wok perfect if not just a normal sized frying pan with big sloping sides pan on get it really nice and hot chicken breast very lean hardly any fat on there you've got this little fillet just slice that off now the secret to getting it really nice and thin and to cut it into strips take your knife keep it nice and flat on the board and sort of slice it in half like a sort of scallop like that we call this butterfly in the chicken take a rolling pin and nice and gently roll over the chicken what it does it sort of flattens it allows you to slice it even thinner and the thinner the slice of the chicken the sort of crispier it gets the quicker it cooks slice it in half start slicing these nice thin slices and the good news is one chicken breast can serve two or three easily next wash your knife and finally slice garlic the thinner the garlic the crispier this is a young tender broccoli just slice them down i want a bite to the broccoli and normally you sort of paste the dish with one-third noodles one-third vegetables and one-third of your protein chicken with a dish that takes literally minutes to put together it's really important to get everything organized everything needs to be at your fingertips touch of olive oil get a pan really nice and ready just starting to smoke drop the chicken in first salt pepper open up those little strands of chicken nice [Music] once you've started to sear off the chicken get the garlic in now let that get really nice and crispy the way to do it is to sort of spread all the chicken the garlic up the side of the pan and see why it's so important to cut the chicken thin strips because it colors and cooks at the same time as well really really crucial now that garlic's getting really nice and crispy broccoli in feels strange putting raw broccoli in like that normally we blanch it in boiling water dry it out but you want that crunch now soy sauce that helps to season it but also stains beautifully soy sauce in lovely it's exactly what i want now take that out give you a pan a little wipe out a little teaspoon of olive oil get that wok really nicely oiled again drain your noodles they're beautiful this is a really exciting way of finishing this quick stir fry very classic two eggs in whisk up the eggs and give that a really good whisk sort of almost spread it out the side of the pan lightly season the eggs noodles in chicken and broccoli in [Music] and give that a really nice mix i want the egg to sort of almost bring the dish together that egg's cooked make sure you've got that nice even distribution of chicken broccoli garlic lovely and then just finish that fresh lime and then you have a very simple delicious stir-fry with rice noodles [Music] smoky pork sliders with barbecue sauce everyone loves a burger they're a true fast food original and that's the exciting thing about street food you can take an old classic like that and reinvent it into something really exciting when you think of a burger what you need is a great sauce and a light smoky barbecue goes hand in glove with a great burger start by finely chopping one onion and three cloves of garlic nice hot pan tablespoon of olive oil onions and garlic into the pan nice seasoning salt and pepper now the secret of a good barbecue sauce is that really important caramelization to begin with a nice tablespoon of brown sugar it darkens the onions but it really starts to sort of give that nice syrupy body to the sauce i put a little bit of heat in there now a nice teaspoon of smoked paprika that's the important part of working with spices you've got to cook them out and almost sort of burn off that rawness especially with a smoked paprika that's exactly where i want it to go onions and garlic beautifully caramelized cider vinegar in reduce that down now i've got a fantastic smoky base to complete the sauce i'm making my life really easy and adding pre-made worcester sauce and tomato ketchup cook that out for two to three minutes now depending on how thick you like the barbecue sauce that determines how long you cook it out for i don't want it to be too runny but i don't want it too thick either that's the consistency we're looking for lovely turn down the gas charger seasoning now take that out it's the kind of sauce that i like to have sort of bottled up in the fridge it's great for sandwiches but goes brilliantly well with these sliders homemade smoky barbecue sauce [Music] give the pan a little wipe now start the mix for the sliders to give my mix a really interesting flavor and texture i'm gonna be using unsmoked back bacon i travel all over the world and i spend a lot of time in the states they know how to make a great slider pork sliders beef sliders chicken sliders and it's almost like a way of having a burger but on a much smaller miniature level a little teaspoon of olive oil i want that bacon to get really nice and crispy bacon in this just gives the really nice sort of chunky delicious mix i want texture and pork is perfect for a slider [Music] and choppy shallot slots are a lot sweeter than your normal white onion fine fine fine and in [Music] now that bacon's getting really nice and crispy i want a bit of heat in there a little teaspoon of smoked paprika in there when you see these sliders in the states for one portion there's like four or five of them little mini one biters incredible now take your pork just open it up and give that a really nice seasoning so important you can't season a slider after you've cooked it it's impossible so season it nicely bacon now that's nice and crispy just take a little touch kitchen roll and just drain that off there [Music] nice pat that nice and dry i want all that nice sort of crispiness in there beautiful mix all that in take a nice ball and sort of roll it size of a golf ball get it nice and round first and then three fingers just pat that down don't flatten them too thin otherwise they overcook and they go sort of dry because sliders are bite-sized burgers designed to go in small buns you don't want to make them too big good get the pan nice and hot a tablespoon of olive oil when a slider is literally that thick about an inch thick we're going to take two and a half to three minutes to each side in turn them over lovely once you've turned them tilt the pan and just spoon all that juice back into them keep my mouth watering now very easy to dry the pork out so just feeling it now your fingers is nice and firm it's a little touch of springiness in the center i'm happy with those add your cheese now so it gets nicely melted i'm using wedges of smoked cheddar and it has that nice sort of soury smoky creaminess to the slider finally shredded baby gem lettuce just take those buns make sure they're sliced nice and evenly take your lettuce be quite generous when the lettuce just a nice thin slice of tomato take your burgers you see that cheese you feed melted your bbq sauce place the top on and that is my version of a slider that is small dynamic but packed full of flavor i'll take that over a hamburger any day [Music] you

If you liked this...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, and one of my all-time favorites a dish that always creates a stir is the daddy of all brunches steak sandwiches [Music] for me the secret of a great brunch is fun and casual fuss-free cooking and everyone helping themselves this is the ultimate steak sandwich you want the rolls royce of beef it has to be fillet now season it beautifully i like to open up the top of the peppermill to increase the size of the pepper in the steak so it gives that bit of heat nice little chunks you just roll now nicely all the way around now slice the garlic in half pan nice and hot olive oil in hold the steak and just place it into the pan don't drop it at the front of the pan we're going to tilt the pan forward to cook the back of the steak dual purpose now roll it back and sear underneath next my garlic and roast that garlic thyme fry that time i want to hear it we're not looking for a lot of color because you're going to dry out the fill it so just one end turn it back down and steer the other end in lift up your time place it on top of the garlic there lift up your fillet and sit there on top of your garlic butter in take a spoon tilt the pan gently lift up and baste i've got that scented garlic thyme flavor the steak is going to cook evenly because it's sat on a little a little bed in the oven for 8 to 10 minutes [Music] pan on for the relish you think of a steak sandwich you think of a sort of nice heated tomato relish to make the relish finely dice a red onion three finger rule one in front two behind through and chop wow next roughly chop a chilli keeping the seeds in for extra heat start off with the olive oil into a pan onions chili [Music] generous with the olive oil i want a nice sort of rich silky relish from there take your tomatoes you can't just use red tomatoes but these yellow and red make the perfect combination now put your salt in cut them and then roast those tomatoes off take a wooden spoon and just sort of break them up once the skins blister the whole tomato just starts to release all that really nice sweet texture a little teaspoon of cherry vinegar gives that nice acidic balance the sweetness of the tomatoes turn down the gas and just let them sort of stew perfectly now a steak sandwich would not be complete unless it had the most amazing mustard mayonnaise simply add three tablespoons of mayonnaise to three teaspoons of whole grain mustard [Music] now i've got the reddish almost down to like a really nice jam now i want to make that relish a little bit more fragrant some basil slice it through sprinkle that basil in there [Music] beautiful look at this there she is my crown jewels time to take it out smell is incredible just baste one more time to fill it the touch is quite soft in the center so it's just coming up to mid-rare let it rest the same time you cooked it it'll be nice and pink evenly throughout the steak to make my sandwich i'm going to char grill some sliced chipatta bread season it nicely just a little drizzle of olive oil i want to get that bread nice and crispy pan nice and hot bread in push it down smell is amazing that char sort of charcoal flavour once you've got those marks on the bread it just stops the bread from becoming soggy and look at this here it is stunning on slice it gently one beautiful slice wow it's nice and pink all the way through and the beef is so soft it's almost like slicing through butter let the knife do the work take a little bit of mayonnaise spread that the back of the spoon on both sides next lettuce take that beautiful slice of beef and then relish on top of that beef and just slice the sandwich in half beautiful now that's what i call a steak sandwich trust me serve the sublime sandwich for brunch and you'll put a smile on everyone's face [Music] my next easy standby supper is beef meatball sandwich with melting mozzarella and tomato salsa [Music] top a lightly toasted roll with pan-fried meatballs then tear off chunks of creamy buffalo mozzarella pile it on and melt it under the grill for the tangy salsa slice sweet red onion then add juicy diced tomatoes and roughly chop fresh coriander season and drizzle with olive oil spoon over [Music] perfect in a flash beef meatball sandwich with melting mozzarella and a tomato salsa a sandwich to die for [Music] melting my lunch when i was growing up was very plain pretty trashy but i still love it now and again fish fingers with a delicious chip butty the secret of a good chip butty is in the potato now these are desiree potatoes one of my first ever jobs was working in a chip shop i used to put sacks and sacks of potatoes into the rumbler which was then the potato peeler all day long today i'm going to do something a little bit healthier for my oven chips with a twist simply peel slice and blanch for three to four minutes drain season and cover well with propeca spread evenly over an oiled baking tray and place into a preheated oven for 20 minutes simple as that next up easy fish fingers this is pollock a really nice firm delicious fish got the fish in finger size batons of fish put them onto your plate and just lightly salt them you can do that literally 20 minutes 30 minutes before you start cooking the fish it firms the fish up beautifully and it allows it to become a little more durable especially in the pan now for the coating start by thoroughly coating the fish in seasoned flour and then just roll it to get rid of those little sharp corners because then it stops those corners almost burning in the pan in to your egg wash and really coat them wonderful and then this is dill goes brilliantly well with a fish and run the dill through my breadcrumbs that makes it more aromatic lay them onto your breadcrumbs nothing wrong with the chip butty nothing wrong with fish fingers just give it a lovely modern twist beautiful once the fish fingers are thoroughly coated they're ready to pan fry and they'll need around three minutes on each side i want the fish fingers to be nice and crispy get a really nice color on them first and then we'll flip them over and finish them with butter bring the heat up into the pan and a nice little knob of butter that'll work wonders with the breadcrumbs and the dill nice and carefully take them out they look and smell incredible stay nice and crispy now to assemble my chip butty starting with buttered thick crusty bread get a slice of bread mop up that amazing flavor on slice in half never slice in an angle my mouth is salivating beautiful on with the ship butti there's one thing missing and it signifies that i've never forgotten the joy i've come for food but my god that makes me feel like a nine-year-old excuse me for a moment when you want to stuff my face [Applause] [Music] homemade fish fingers and my ultimate chip buddy so simple to make but trust me it tastes amazing [Music] this is a picnic sandwich with a twist but the secret is in the layers i'm gonna make a delicious tapenade a puree of olives seasoned with capers and anchovies a nice tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil garlic in a little teaspoon of red wine vinegar that just sort of zaps up the flavor quite like leaving it nice and chunky tastes better and feels richer i much prefer spreading a smooth layer of tapenade rather than using butter now to prepare my first mediterranean sandwich filling i want nice long slices of courgette because yes can be a bland vegetable season them nicely once that grill's nice and hot a tablespoon of olive oil the more color you put on those courgettes the more flavor while my griddle courgette's cool i can prepare the bread this is a stunning beautiful country loaf but we're not gonna slice it i'm just gonna cut the top off because i'm assembling a picnic sandwich basket and then an inch from the crust and go around scoop out a nice large hollow don't waste this bread put that out to dry it makes the most amazing bread crumbs the secret now is filling that cavity with all those wonderful mediterranean flavors i'm going to leave them to sort of sit and marinate lightly season the inside of the loaf drizzle of olive oil line with that wonderful tapenade and spread it generously puts the groundwork in starts to set the tone for the flavors that we're incorporating traditionally the main protein in pambanya would be tuna i'm sticking with the med but replacing the fish with some of my family's italian favorites palmer i'll start lining my sandwich from the center every time i add another ingredient it's just another stunning layer of texture and flavor but what i'm thinking about is what actually complements the next layer mozzarella a little spoon of my tapenade we've got the most amazing tequila pepper so we've got a nice smoky barbecue flavor open them up and lay them on top next layer these wonderful grilled courgettes on top of that some blush tomatoes concentrated but really chewy and delicious and each time lightly press them down creamy mozzarella again and then finally peppers push that down not too firm fold in and seal that with your tapenade almost like a little glue now lid on to seal all that flavor in there and not only travels well but actually tastes delicious that is one stunning picnic sandwich next a brilliant picnic salad that's just as robust as your pan bun yeah carrots and cumin and orange perfect combination again travels brilliantly it doesn't wilt it doesn't disintegrate orange zest [Music] squeeze the orange over sunflower seeds a bit of crunch in there pumpkin seeds again another bite next a hint of spice toasted cumin seeds ground with the help of a little coarse sea salt a nice fine powder now for the dressing tablespoon of dijon mustard tablespoon of honey half a tablespoon of white wine vinegar and then a nice glug of olive oil fresh mint and coriander the minute you start picking fresh herbs all that flavor comes out a nice mix vinaigrette mix that in give enough dressing bind it together excite the palette not drown it if it was a leaf salad then i'd take the dressing separately but because this is a robust root vegetable they can sustain being dressed now and eaten in two hours time sweet spicy fragrant can't really ask much more from a carrot can you beautiful [Music] just when your guests think that you're cutting up a delicious country loaf [Music] look at that baby wow and who would not want to join you on a picnic with a sandwich like that my ultimate picnic lunch to surprise and impress panbania bursting with rich sunshine flavors and serve with a refreshingly zingy carrot cumin and orange salad [Music]

#GordonRamsay #Cooking #Food #Apples 

Gordon Ramsay's Ultimate Fit Food/Healthy, Lean...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, [Music] apples were my favorite fruit growing up originally came from china but today in britain we grow over 2 000 different types [Music] the most popular eating apples in the uk are braven and gala but don't miss out on some of the older types like the sweet nutty russets and fragrant coxes when it comes to cooking apples it's got to be a sharp brambly which i'm using as part of my compot for lunch now for the apple compote what we need to do first is to get these peeled and sliced i get my pan on to get nice and hot now let me give you a little taste of that they're incredibly acidic okay and you need to cook them those wonderful red apples you've got are called bray burns what other apples do you know green ones what they called um i'm not too sure what the green one is another word for your nan grandmas no red no pink lady apple no granny smith granny smith apples that's right what we're gonna do is cook the cooking apples and the eating apples together i love the combination of the tartness from the brambly cooking apple with the sweetness of the braeburn get the pan nice and hot and sprinkle the bottom of the pan with caster sugar three or four nice slices of fresh ginger and three little cinnamon sticks i want you to remember that because we're gonna look for them okay because once we've used them and they've worked their magic i need to pull them out see all the sugar dissolving definitely now we just let that go a little bit darker okay and then the place is quick doesn't it give that a nice little toss okay nice golden color cinnamon in ginger in so we're cooking down the apples butter in gently cook until the apples soften then take off the heat and they go into there what's that coming out dad so that is a little bit of the puree i'll show we'll do that in a minute how many ginger four four ginger and three cinnamon three cinnamon out with a cinnamon we've got another ginger gingers and we take a spoon of apples it smells so nice how nice is that look see the coloury apples let's put these in the fridge to get nice and cold that's the compost sorted easy now a simple creamy whip to crown the top do you separate the egg whites into there for daddy all right egg whites are in egg whites are separated and i'll sprinkle the sugar in and then you turn up the speed [Applause] good girl [Music] now let's see if you've got a really nice stiff peak so you lift them up now that is what i call a nice stiff peak well done not bad not bad next in a separate bowl whip double cream until stiff nice and slowly so cream whips so much quicker yeah nice that by hand we're gonna put some delicious lemon zest which will make the cream so much better then sweeten it up with leftover caramely compot puree you mix that in nice and carefully so it's like this apple butterscotch now to make the cream even lighter fold in those whisked egg whites and sugar egg whites into the cream just nicely fold that in so you bring your glasses back out manage the glasses yep good girl silly we're on for a treat open up the piping bag now twist the end now you could spoon this in but i want to just give a nice little lift it also gives it a nice pattern lemon on top back in the fridge irresistible cinnamon eggy bread with quick stewed apples i've never forgotten i think it was about six years of age when mum brought this huge tray of eggy bread to the table and it was like wow man we've died and gone to heaven start off with a slightly stale bread four or five day old loaf left over if it's a fresh bread then it absorbs too much of the egg so therefore it gets soggy you never get it fried and crisp and if you're not gonna use the breadcrumbs eggy bread is a must in france they call it pan perdu the lost loaf now eggy bread is great on its own but serving it with stewed apples is delicious so the secret here keeping the skins on it's a lot of flavor in the skin and also it stops the apple from breaking down too quickly they get these nice chunks as opposed to a sort of apple puree [Music] now get your pan nice and hot and sprinkle a couple of tablespoons of sugar take the sugar down to a light caramel it's quite incredible how cheap it is to make this and yet it was so filling if you haven't got apples this recipe will work pretty much with any fruit you've got in don't be scared to mix a pear and an apple a banana and a pineapple just chew it lightly toss in the caramel get a little knot of butter that makes a nice toffee apple flavor really simple now you can see what's happening the apples are caramelizing but they're staying intact because the skins on the apple and the caramel's turned into this nice rich butterscotch sauce once you've glazed all the apples a couple of tablespoons of water in there bring that bowl and let that cook out now the eggs three whole eggs whisk up the eggs add about four tablespoons of milk you want the egg thick and rich and then lightly sprinkle in a couple of tablespoons of sugar that sweetens up the mixture and when you start frying the bread it caramelizes it beautifully a teaspoon of powdered cinnamon that gives the bread that really nice spicy deliciousness apples are glazing beautifully and put them on a low heat and get a pan on now for the bread a teaspoon of oil that stops the butter from burning butter in as that starts frothing get your bread in it's going to be pretty quick now now you don't leave the bread soak in drain and in the pan once your egg bread has browned flip it over 90 seconds each side that butter gives that nice golden brown color of that egg [Music] beautiful absolutely beautiful it's quite remarkable isn't it a couple of eggs splash of milk leftover apples and all of a sudden you've got this stunning breakfast [Music] now my apples they've all glazed beautifully get a nice spoon of that amazing juice and drizzle that over mmm wow if my mum saw me doing this she'd kill me you're getting all posh again no no i'm using a touch of iced sugar to make him look stunning that for me takes me back to when i was six years of age and i thought i just won the lottery that is incredible thank you brett you won't get more breakfast for your buck my mum's incredibly delicious cinnamon eggy bread with quick stewed

Gordon Ramsay's Ultimate Fit Food/Healthy, Lean and Fit – http://po...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, first a breakfast to really set you up for the day easy homemade spicy baked beans with deliciously light potato cakes [Music] the first big thing that i remember as a kid was bacon and beans so this is like a little rendition except we're using the most amazing pancetta ernie come on disappear go and chase some mice now panel get nice and hot i'm gonna turn these beans into glamorous beans pancetta into the pan lightly season that it's cured so it doesn't need that much seasoning now start frying off that pancetta it's amazing how the individual tastes of baked beans they're somewhat bland so i always like to make them a little bit more spicy so a nice finely chopped chili with the seeds chili in now a little bit of garlic crushed phenomenal get that bacon really nice and crispy fry off the chili and the garlic and then onions my top tip for dicing finely sliced downwards slice across then cut down to simply dice bacon onion chilli garlic that flavour all contained in that little pan once you've sweated the onion off a little bit of sugar in there the brown sugar will start to caramelize darken and enrich it as well at the same time that looks beautiful now a couple of tablespoons of cider vinegar delays the pan it's got that really nice powerful kick to it now spice that up with one of my favorite seasonings worcester sauce bring that to the boil and add your passata puree tomatoes turn that down some of the sauce to reduce then add in the classic baked bean harrico beans you can buy haircut beans dried or canned they are packed with protein and have a lovely soft texture turn down the heat and let the beans absorb all that beautiful spicy tomato sauce and just let that simmer now five or six minutes now for my potato cakes they're a fantastic way to use leftover boiled potatoes and are so easy to make i'm making a simple potato dough by adding flour and butter to the mash that gives it that nice sort of cakey texture and it goes from this leftover ball potato to this nice light flowery potato heaven take a nice spoon of potato lightly flour your board we're gonna fry these crisp on the outside and just nice and fluffy in the center now get your pan nice and hot we'll start off with olive oil into the pan now put the butter around the outside because it starts heating up by the time it goes into the center it's always sort of nut brown gently turn them over love that nice light crisp they look beautiful now take them out oh potato cake in the middle and a nice beautiful spoon of beans growing up with beans on toast as a treat still to this day after all those years has not changed my love or attitude for beans especially cooked like that my smoky spicy homemade baked beans with light and creamy potato cakes comfort and satisfaction on a plate [Music] when i was growing up food in britain was somewhat different to what it is now no one had heard of organic you couldn't even buy avocados in the shops where i lived paris kitchens might have been cooking nouvelle cuisine but it certainly hadn't made any inroads around our way malta my lunch when i was growing up was very plain pretty trashy but i still love it now and again fish fingers with a delicious chip butty secret of a good chip butty is in the potato now these are desiree potatoes one of my first ever jobs was working in a chip shop i used to put sacks and sacks of potatoes into the rumbler which will send the potato peeler all day long today i'm gonna do something a bit healthier for my oven chips with a twist simply peel slice and blanch for three to four minutes drain season and cover well with papika spread evenly over an oiled baking tray and place into a preheated oven for 20 minutes simple as that next up easy fish fingers this is pollock a really nice firm delicious fish got the fish in finger size batons of fish put them onto your plate and just lightly salt them you can do that literally 20 minutes 30 minutes before you start cooking the fish it firms the fish up beautifully and it allows it to become a little more durable especially in the pan now for the coating start by thoroughly coating the fish in seasoned flour and then just roll it to get rid of those little sharp corners because then it stops those corners almost burning in the pan in to your egg wash and really coat them wonderful and then this is dill goes brilliantly well with a fish and run the dill through my breadcrumbs that makes it more aromatic lay them onto your breadcrumbs nothing wrong with the chip butty nothing wrong with fish fingers just give it a lovely modern twist beautiful once the fish fingers are thoroughly coated they're ready to pan fry and they'll need around three minutes on each side i want the fish fingers to be nice and crispy get a really nice color on them first and then we'll flip them over and finish them with butter bring the heat up into the pan and a nice little knob of butter that'll work wonders with the breadcrumbs and the dill nice and carefully take them out they look and smell incredible stay nice and crispy now to assemble my chip butty starting with buttered thick crusty bread your slice of bread mop up that amazing flavor on slice in half never slice in an angle my mouth is salivating beautiful on with the ship butty there's one thing missing and it signifies that i've never forgotten the joy i've come for food but my god that makes me feel like a nine year old excuse me for a moment we want to stuff my face homemade fish fingers and my ultimate chip buddy so simple to make but trust me it tastes amazing a dish becomes a classic because it's delicious and somehow strikes are called with us it just works sometimes these dishes can become tired but a clever twist helps make them fresh again you can't get more classic than a centuries-old midday meal of bread cheese and beer reinvented and marketed by pubs as a plan was launched in the 60s i'm now giving it my 21st century take like plummets with the most amazing but super simple beer baked bread hearty and full of flavor for a really quick and easy bread dough sieve a mix of wholemeal and self-raising white flour with a good pinch of salt salt is really important the bread it's the first thing i do once i've cracked it and smelt you want to smell that salt baked throughout beer in about 250 mils of beer [Music] the reason why this recipe works so well is it the beer it's got that yeast so naturally it's gonna work beautifully give that a really good mix i'm looking for the mixture to be quite wet if the dough becomes too firm then it's going to cook dry in the center just as it starts to fall through the whisk that is perfect beautiful this mix will work really well as one large loaf but i want to make my plan ones a little bit more special small tins give it that kind of intimacy and i quite like having my own little loaf give the molds a really nice lining with butter make sure you butter the top now tablespoon of flour dust inside the mold that will stop your mixture sticking tap out any excess three quarters fill your little molds we're going to allow it to sort of rise just so it comes above the mold and forms this really nice miniature loaf onto the tray centimeter apart into the oven 25 to 30 minutes at 180. something quite nice about the smell of home baked bread in the kitchen delicious no plan was it's complete without pickled onions red onion is a lot sweeter less harsh than a white onion the early days of plum ones you've got those ghastly sharp pickled onions that make you almost cry when you're crunching them i'm gonna lightly pickle my red onion just push your fingers through so you get these nice sort of onion rings a little touch of salt a little sprinkle of sugar and then a couple of cloves in there that gives it a really nice sort of perfume and sort of makes the pickling slightly more mellow red wine vinegar now if you haven't got red wine vinegar white wine vinegar it's just as good but red matches the red onion so it goes hand in glove a couple of tablespoons of vinegar just give that a really good mix to speed up the pickling process use a weight to put pressure on the onions as the weight presses down on the onions the clove the salt the sugar the vinegar work their magic and it comes out with a really nice light fragrant pickle for my 21st century ploughmans i'm creating an all-in-one salad and bringing the traditional elements together with a punchy dressing a tablespoon of english mustard a tablespoon of honey a touch of salt and pepper and finish off with white wine vinegar and olive oil [Music] now generally it's sort of three parts oil to one part vinegar that's the sort of general base [Music] you don't really think of a vinaigrette with a plan ones but this is a really nice sort of modern approach to ploughmans for my plan salad i'm using a mixture of robust and crunchy romaine lettuce and punchy watercress if i was making a watercress soup i'd use the stalks but the stalks are a little bit bitter so i just grabbed them like that pinch them and then twist very peppery very hot but so juicy watercress in your celery chop it nice and finely it's the one thing that everybody leaves is that stick of celery so scatter it amongst the salad a bit of oomph and color from some sliced radishes and sweetness from a thinly sliced apple whilst you're busy throwing your plum and salad together do not forget about your beer bread before it comes out i'm gonna glaze the top with a little touch of milk that'll put a really nice finish to the bread back in for the last five minutes now for the magic in the plan ones generally you'll see it as a ham or cheddar or stilton flourman's it's hard to dictate which one's the best so for the ultimate plowmans i'm adding all three brilliant cheddar peel some nice shards of that delicious creamy cheddar just get them dancing on top the dressing drizzle ran in circles and then finally our delicious lightly pickled onions give them a good squeeze and look just dot the onions around bread it's ready it's got that nice yeasty smell warm crusty and delicious there you go that is my classic modern version of a traditional stunning player lens wow my delicious all-in-one plan one salad with individual beer bread loaves updated for the 21st century you

Gordon...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, [Music] breakfast lunch and dinner whether it's at my restaurants or at home i think food should always stand up and be noticed it doesn't matter if a dish is light and delicate or full-on and gutsy the flavors should be distinct and clear and that means always getting the maximum taste from your ingredients today it's all about vibrant muscular food so fasting your seatbelt for my ultimate breakfast lunch and dinner packed with big and bold flavors first up a punchy breakfast of murgues and fontina stuffed croissants flavor there is incredible for lunch a spicy mexican soup be adventurous but beware serve with quick tortilla chips and a peek of the guy or dip maggie for dinner i'll be setting the world to write with my eldest megan you're so annoying i'm so annoyed when we make one of her favorite dishes crispy roast duck with pancakes and black bean dipping sauce seen as is your favorite that you can make it followed by a spiced banana tart to tan wow these are my ultimate recipes for a day bursting with their big and bold breakfast lunch and dinner starting with a breakfast that can't fail to wake you up merguez and fontina stuffed croissants okay big and bold i was living in france i stayed there for three years once twice a week i treated myself to the most amazing bold breakfast and it started off with these beauties here murgays cheap but incredibly tasty start off with a nice hot pan murgay's in it's a very spicy sausage doesn't need any help doesn't even need chili just a touch of salt and pepper you can smell the spice they're starting to release all that wonderful oil that flavor in there add a couple of cloves i'll finely slice garlic spread the garlic across the pan it instantly changes color takes on this nice dark rich golden color now take a look with the heat out with the parsley the stalks of soft herbs like parsley and coriander can be used to impart flavor during cooking but the leaves should always be added just before serving to give maximum colour and fragrance [Music] and then finish that off with my capers amazing all right beautiful now take your quests on they're literally 24 hours old so they're crispy on the outside and just slice off the lid this recipe is a great way to use up any leftover croissants from the day before i used to cringe when i saw the french cooks throw away croissants i used to cry thinking oh my god any idea what you're throwing away in terms of flavor whatever you do do not wipe out that pan dunk your croissants mopping up all that amazing flavor and caramelizing the inside for that beautiful and don't forget the lids and then get your thumbs and go inside the croissant all i want to do now is just create a little pocket and just manipulate the crescent now this is where it gets exciting mix up the capers the garlic and sausages look at the color of that wonderful delicious flavoured oil now some cheese but not just any cheese fontina cheese is like the number one cheese for grilling and because it's a very rich cheese you shave it thinner than you would a white truffle but it gives a really nice saltiness and a light smokey flavour a touch of pepper salt place these big boys on the tray literally 30 seconds on the grill here we go nice crisp packed full of flavor now top them and that for me it's almost like being back in paris except this time i don't have to share them with the french my ultimate big and bold breakfast murgays and fontina stuffed croissants a great way to start the day [Music] never be scared of trying new flavors in your cooking a few key ingredients can make all the difference here's a closer look at some i'll be using later peppercorns may be small but whatever the color in terms of flavor they're one of the heavy weights of the kitchen with the exception of the pink type all peppercorns are fruits from the same flowering vine it's the stage at which they are harvested and how they are processed that determines their unique colors and tastes [Music] today i'll be using the fiery black and perfume pink types to add a big bold punch to my pudding [Music] for dinner i'll be cooking duck hugely popular in chinese cuisine this bird may be less meaty than a chicken but its intense rich flavor means the meat goes a long long way [Music] wild or farmed duck meat is packed with protein vitamins and essential nutrients and i'm going to slow roast one in my dinner dish of crispy roast duck with pancakes chilis are a fabulous ingredient and one of my absolute favorites is the chipotle chipotles begin life as a green jalapeno pepper the process of drying and smoking lends an intense smoky flavor to balance their spicy heat dried chipotles can be brought as a paste powder or whole which is how i'll be using them in my big bold lunch chilies come in all shapes and sizes and heat and are used throughout the world but if there's one cuisine that has really turned cooking them into an art form it's mexican they're experts at building layer upon layer flavored with delicious chilies and spices so for my ultimate big and bold lunch spicy mexican soup it's hearty delicious robust but served with some tortillas and a wonderful salsa it's almost like a complete meal in one starting with some finely chopped red onions for my soup let's get some heat going early these are chipotle so they're smoky rich they don't come with any warning signal and these are seriously hot so be adventurous but beware a nice teaspoon of toasted cumin oregano dried now start frying off spices the heat you'll see the chilies start swelling up delicious garlic be quite generous on the oil because that helps to blow out the chili right now those onions and garlic are on fire we're going to balance the sort of heat from the chipotle with sugar turn up the heat and really start caramelizing that sugar and the chili gives off the most amazing aroma next fry up a tablespoon of tomato puree add a can of chopped tomatoes cook kidney beans and vegetable or chicken stock to cover there's something quite exciting about big and bold flavors because in the restaurants you have to be somewhat controlled you can't go crazy so cooking these kind of dishes at home gives me that kind of release chilis particularly when they're dried continue to swell and release their heat as they're cooked so the longer you cook your dish the hotter it will be [Music] but it's not as powerful it needs to be yet and every five six seven eight minutes that's gonna get stronger hotter and more delicious bring that up to the ball and cook that out for 15 minutes whilst i allow the chili heat to infuse i'm going to crack on with quick crunchy tortilla chips and a fabulously fresh and spicy tomato salsa known in mexico as pico de gallo start by finely dicing three ripe tomatoes one or two deseeded fresh jalapeno peppers and half a red onion then chop a good handful of fresh coriander add the juice from two limes salt and pepper and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil for the tortilla chips rub a little olive oil onto six large shop bought wheat wraps sprinkle with smoked paprika and gently massage in cut each wrap into triangles and spread them onto a baking tray bake for three to four minutes in a preheated oven 180 degrees until golden brown and leave to cool to complete my mexican lunch i need to finish my deliciously fragrant spicy soup the spice is there it is absolutely spot on now for the cooling down process the mexicans are brilliant at building layer upon layer of flavor with delicious chilies and spices but they're also experts at tempering their dishes with cooling ingredients like avocado sour cream and cheese that's why you can take that amount of chili you don't have a spoon of richness spice and all of a sudden avocados almost like a little fire blanket over those chillies to further counter the chilli heat mexicans use a rich tangy crumbly cheese but i'm sprinkling on lancashire which is a great british substitute and last but not least cooling fresh coriander one delicious spicy mexican soup serve that with your tortilla chips and your pico de gallo salsa a phenomenal blend of textures and layers and spice and creaminess big bold and delicious one of the secrets to making fantastic food at home is learning to be confident when you're using strong flavors all dishes need to be balanced but don't be afraid of using herbs and spices to make your cooking vibrant and exciting here's my ultimate big and bold dinner a meal that demands to be taken notice of [Music] and helping me in the kitchen is my eldest daughter megan crispy roasted up with pancakes with the addy kick of a black bean dipping sauce megan gonna help with the duck danny your favorite yes it is now how's your boyfriend right i'm going come on that woke you up didn't it so what do you love most about duck the dipping sauce the dipping sauce i love that uh let's get the duck in the oven first let's get a bit of salt in there please then some pepper thank you some spring onion garlic and ginger now why do you think we pour that in there to season it and flavor it how come you put them in hole like that and not smaller it's going inside i'm not using it for sauce or anything so it's just going to make it really nice what are they star anise sorry so what happens as the duck roasts on the outside it creates this really nice perfume aroma inside tuck that in there to get it spicy rub all that chinese five spice yeah over almost like you're massaging good so make sure you get it all in even the little wings you know underneath her just like i used to do to you my bath i used to wash your little handys i know those days are long gone i know i know i know dad that is seriously spicy with the duck there's generally quite a lot of fat there yeah so we're gonna put it on this little bench okay and that goes there by slowly roasting it okay it's gonna get nice and crisp on the outside all that fat is gonna render inside the breast so therefore it's gonna get all nice and juicy yeah right ducks in three and a half hours at 160 degrees celsius your favorite part you said was the dipping sauce why is it your favorite part i think it really adds to the dark it makes it really tasty cena's is your favorite you can make it i'm gonna do nothing okay daddy's gonna put his feet up so uh first off the garlic there's one good girl watch your fingers please always do good nice oh you're fast huh watch your fingers i am watch your fingers slide slow down please 14. all right that's enough right little teaspoon of olive oil in a few years time i'll be teaching how to drive as well as cook how exciting is that you know in a car scary okay garlickin crispy duck is traditionally served with hoisin sauce but my brood love the additional big bold punch of black beans nice megan and i add soy sauce and lastly for that classic chinese sweet and sour element brown rice vinegar and honey [Music] are you happy with the flavour i'm really happy can you taste everything in there dipping sauce done ducks in the oven let's start the dessert the most amazing tata tan are those pink peppercorns they are pink peppercorns they're really good they don't taste anything like black peppercorns quite sweet aren't they they're really sweet very fruity the pink peppercorns give it the sweetness the black peppercorns give the heat now what is that baby vanilla this is one of the easiest desserts in the world to make but one of the most delicious it's a sort of take on the classic apple or pear to tan but when you caramelize those bananas with the peppercorns and the vanilla i bet that tastes amazing oh my goodness incredible okay i'm gonna make the camera start off with the cold pen first and you just press that button in there how come do you do it like that and not let it just melt naturally because i want the butter to stay cold because i'm gonna stick the bananas in there okay and then we'll make the caramel and caramelize the bananas at the same time so in goes those vanilla vanilla seeds pods in there as well okay peppercorns done yeah well done good girl sprinkle them over that butter just naturally naturally yeah nice and then look just very carefully sprinkle sugar over that you're doing them all the same size roughly the same size wedge it into the butter well do you know what want the bananas really caramelized you just stuck them between if you crown them in like this okay it will stop them moving around nothing's moving nothing is okay it's all wedged in there spreading the peppercorns on top of the bananas so you can feel that flavor in the caramel and on the top and the bottom right puff pastry puff pastry is difficult and time consuming to make so i always buy ready-made when i'm at home to get the best flavor and texture go for the all butter type and keep your pastry cold before using it this is where it gets really exciting you get your fingers you just pinch the end so you thin the end if you do that for me very carefully you have to be quick because the heat your fingers can melt the pastry how comes you do it dad because we get it nice and thin so we can clip it underneath now take a spoon and what we do is lift up that banana and tuck it underneath see little parcel like a parcel and see the thin bits of pastry yeah how easy it is to get it underneath yeah and that's why you thin them out you do it so quickly well because i have to be quick otherwise the pastry will melt notice how we're not using anything sharp so we're not would that cut the pastry that's right see how locked down that is [Music] gas on we'll start caramelizing her those three little holes are so important if we didn't put a hole in the pastry and it will cause a lot of steam so the pastry never cooks it just goes really soggy okay so really important the caramel is live now we're working the camel give a little shake how can you see the caramel through the pastry look what happens when it tilts oh yeah see all comes running down see yeah i see now that pastry okay it's like clinging on to the bananas and so when we turn it upside down we've got this glove full of these caramelized bananas look at that wow it looks like look a locky looking lucky ah look at likey got it now baby you're very annoying i'm sorry it's your birthday soon 15. i've just worked it out i'm my 50th you're 18. perfect we should do a joint party yeah love it twelve two four for the old ones twelve lunches have time till four for the old one so they can go to sleep megan we'll go on later come on perfect here's where i get excited now look at the color of that caramel so tilt the pan again see how dark it is now yeah wow it's going a lot darker now it didn't take long didn't take long at all that's nearly ready for the oven but before i put that in i'll get the duck out wow how's the duck doing crispy wow and delicious how crispy that is it's really crispy that's what happens when it slow cooks so 20 minutes for the duck to rest and 20 minutes in the oven 190 to 200 degrees for our banana tartar tan time to knock up a quick hoisin and cucumber salad to put in our crispy duck pancakes for the dressing combine hoisin sauce rice wine vinegar soy sauce a dash of sesame oil and to give it that zingy asian punch some freshly grated root ginger [Music] for the salad trim and cut spring onions into very fine matchsticks peel a whole cucumber into long thin ribbons and shred in a couple of baby gem lettuces season and toss this fresh crunchy salad in the sweet yummy hoisin dressing a combination that never fails to get the kids eating their greens wow look at that so see now where that pastry is caramelizing caramel so dark and just a little tip gas back on and that will release it because if you tip it and it's still sticking then some of your bananas will stick yeah so now see when it starts spinning around like this moving around and here we are the moment of truth when you know your daddy is the best chef in the world ready yep wow the vanilla how delicious is really good as well right start to stand out done crispy dipping sauce cucumber salad ready so if you take them and your dipping sauce take them over thank you i'll take the duck don't drop it promise oh okay it was amazing my ultimate big and bold dinner of crispy roast duck with pancakes with a hoisin dressed salad and some extra oomph from megan's favorite black bean dipping sauce nice ollie i think you need a bit more duck in there you heard me home honestly it's like a black burrito and for a big and bold pudding delicious spiced banana tartar tan jack's gonna be so hot can i have a little bit of me i think we might have to save him some swimming makes him very hungry that's saving the wishbone of the duck that's me [Music] there are loads more

#GordonRamsay #Cooking...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, [Music] some of the best food i had in india was street food and every little food stall was cooking up something spicy something delicious little teaspoon of oil gonna toast off a teaspoon of cumin mustard seeds a touch of salt and pepper lightly fry them off it's really important to cook off the spices it intensifies the flavor but really draws out that nice spicy deep rich flavor so onion three fingers one in front two behind nice and fine onions in now we're going to caramelize those onions mustard seeds have started to infuse cumin has that nice kick now with a little touch of butter in there get it nice and sort of rich gas up nice and high and really caramelise those onions now once the onions have turned a rich golden color that's what i'm looking for that is beautiful add baby spinach keep that pan nice and hot if you don't cook it out the actual breakfast ends up watering when the spinach is cooked set aside and it's on to the spicy eggs now the breakfast really starts to come alight four nice eggs now give those eggs a little whisk a little touch of butter into the pan a little teaspoon of oil so the butter doesn't burn when the butter and oil are hot add a teaspoon of garam masala and turmeric cook that out now take your eggs into the pan almost gonna make like a really nice spicy scrambled egg turn the gas down now as the scrambled egg comes together just finish that with a little bit of butter i quite like the sort of creaminess makes it so much more delicious and then from there i get my spinach chop up and then fold in the spinach to your scrambled egg something quite exciting about eating spice for breakfast but it's served in these wonderful little thin naan breads this will work with any flatbread or wrap you fancy and then lightly toast your naan take the eggs off the heat whilst you get on with the last job add quick mint and spice yogurt dressing a couple of tablespoons of fresh yogurt in there's always something to take out the heat then add chopped mint salt and turmeric mix that in now take a scrambled egg and half fill and now it smells incredible get your yogurt down on top and lift that over and for me that's what really stands out with street food in india how delicious they can make street food with a little bit of spice amazing [Music] once you try this spicy wrap i promise you scrambled eggs will never taste the same in order to make sure that the batter stays nice and crispy and the fish stays nice and firm the secret is to season the fish salt and pepper that will draw out the moisture and that will keep the fish really nice and firm put it in the fridge for around 10 minutes to let the seasoning work its magic now the batter as always when making any batter always sieve the flour i want a bit of heat in the batter so a nice teaspoon of cayenne pepper season the flour salt and pepper and then two teaspoons of baking powder this almost lightens the load of the batter now ginger beer it gives that batter this sort of unique spicy individual flavor it's delicious with a fish and a nice tablespoon of oil just basic vegetable oil gives it a nice sheen give that a good mix you really want it almost like the consistency of double cream too thin and the batter runs off especially when it hits the fryer too thick and it actually prevents the fish from getting cooked so you've got to get it to that just that sort of double cream texture let it rest for as long as possible to give you an even textured batter now the season should have worked its magic and drawn out the excess moisture from the fish so it's on to the next stage fish has gone slightly firmer perfect for frying start by coating the fish in flour seasoned with pepper pat that nice and dry into your hands so you haven't got any excess flour the flour stops the batter from running off the fish i'm just gonna check to see if my oil's ready by putting a little touch of batter into the fryer you see it bubbling straight to the very top that tells you that the oil is ready never really ever fill the pan above halfway if the oil starts to get too hot first thing you do turn off the gas second thing add some oil into it to cool it down hold the fish by the corner unless you put it in and roll it round then gently slap the fish on the sides of the bowl to get rid of excess batter now in and lay away and just gently drop it in twist your pan that stops it from sticking at the bottom oil should be gently sort of bubbling away but notice as we're frying the fish there's no spitting of any water from the fish fry the fish for three to five minutes gently turning halfway through once the batter is golden and crisp it's ready look they look stunning it's like these big crispy pillows of beautifully textured cart leave the fish to rest on a kitchen towel to blot excess oil meanwhile it's quick and easy chilly minted mushy peas now how much you peas a little teaspoon of olive oil and a nice knob of butter into the pan shallot finely chopped that adds a bit of sweetness to the peas slots into the pan chili these are delicious when you eat peas and they're slightly spicy they're even better garlic in the peas sweat off the chilli the garlic and the slots before the peas join those spices simply blanch in salted boiling water infuse with their perfect partner fresh mint stalks and all and then put your frozen peas in now what's the peas i've got nice and soft drain them now take off the stalks and then add your peas to the shallots i love that sound mix all that chili and garlic in there a little seasoning finishing the frozen peas off like this absolutely delicious onto your board crush now you cannot beat crushed delicious peas those peas is incredible top with chopped mint chilli minted mushy peas so simple and perfect with easy ginger beer battered fish a nice spicy crispy batter and that just reaffirms the importance of comfort food if you're gonna do it do it properly [Music] oh my spicy twist is proof you can update a comforting classic and the best way to eat this is with crispy buttered sauteed potatoes cooked with garlic rosemary and thyme to take this happy food to a whole new [Music] level

couple of tablespoons of oil the marinade in how nice little taste not your finger jack that's really good right wings in get your hands in there and start rubbing in the marinade please okay so the secret now is to coat the chicken wings and all that marinade yeah yeah how long do you leave them in here do you know what the longer the better cover that with limp film wash your hands excellent good job ideally marinate your wings overnight but half an hour will be enough to get the flavors going [Applause] right so they've marinated now if you take the tray out people bottom one thank you and then we're gonna put some tinfoil on there thank you so hold that in half it stops them from sticking and that'll stop the wings from burning so from there get them really dipped in that marinade and try and get the wing like that and just sort of scoop it look like that so get that really nice glaze on there and then just yeah so that garlic will roast and i got all those wings usually done i can make then ready for the oven 170 25 to 30 minutes yep good man excellent nice it's hot wings are in right to go with my ultimate southeast asian dinner rice cooked in homemade thai green curry paste for the easy green curry paste roughly chopped coriander lemongrass green chilies lime leaf shallots garlic and ginger a glug of oil and blitz the paste takes minutes to make but it'll keep for up to 10 days if covered with oil and stored in a sealed jar in the fridge to awaken the flavors lime roll to release the juice next season with salt and pepper and blend into a smooth paste heat the paste until aromatic add in cooled or leftover rice i love using fragrant jasmine rice but your standard long grain rice is great too thoroughly heated through serve thai green curry paste is so easy to make so with rice like this it's incredible but simply add to chicken fish or veg to create a fantastic meal in minutes right now for the green beans beans in uh bring the water to the ball what's the first thing i should put in there beans salt salt so nice pinch of salt in there yeah so make an amazing dressing two nine tablespoons yep of a crunchy peanut butter please why is it crunchy it'll give it texture and it'll be nice and sort of chunky green beans in okay got the rice green beans we're gonna blotch them for two two and a half minutes what does blanching actually mean blanching means sort of part cooking okay i'm gonna blanch them in boiling water yeah and then finish them in the pan use the back of the spoon a little bit easier a teaspoon of brown sugar and she goes nice is that a little bit too thick maybe yeah it is let's put a little touch more soy sauce in there let it down yeah yeah nice smell a little touch of vinegar nice i'm going to get a pan on now put my beans so a little taste did you taste it it's so good oh man hmm wow so if you got the garlic like that i'm going to slice the garlic down like this keep the knife nice and flat that way you'll slice through it but take your time don't worry about the speed and technique right first just cut it in half okay your fingers good and then lay the flat side down so it's nice and sturdy and that nail there it's not out like that it's just guiding the knife so you can never cut yourself like that good i'll drain the beans nice a little tablespoon of oil get the pan nice and hot i'm gonna throw the garlic good nice mmm so fine i smell that already is that lovely so give that a little toss so when you toss it push it down push away and pull back okay have a little go push it down and gently take

cheerful chicken wing yeah all right let me take them over please do not drop them okay jack let's go nice this is my ultimate simple southeast asian dinner sticky spicy chicken wings thai green curry rice and fantastic beans with chili peanut dressing guaranteed to get the fussiest of eaters into greens that is the most amazing pork butt that's away butts away now this is incredible there's the shoulder yeah and look there's the shoulder blade if you go through here there's a knuckle there that's connecting the top and that's why it's called a butt the slower you cook it the more juicy it is and it's great for big parties because you just come along and get your fork and shred it a delicious smoky mayonnaise and you're away onions into half and half again okay i'm gonna leave the roots on okay because i want this to sit underneath the pork it gives it a chance to cook evenly it doesn't get dry in the bottom really important okay now i'll peel the garlic okay i'd like you and to crush

really quick okay and sort of rub that mushroom in almost that's exactly that smells amazing honestly you just drizzle a little touch of olive oil on top of that for me i keep the pork nice and moist lovely like some of the best party dishes the marinading of the pork shoulder can be done days in advance so if i was doing this for a sunday and start marinating thursday friday so it gets even tastier right quite easy as well to make it's very easy five and a half to six hours in the oven at 140. while our pork butt slowly roasts meg and i are going to pimp some shop bought mayonnaise i don't like just plain mayonnaise there's so many things you have to twist yeah there's so many things some of the exciting things you can do with it right salt pepper and little touch of honey sweetness yeah sweetness but there's some heat coming okay and i've got a little bit off you love this chipotle smoked chipotle paste i love that once you've made this dressing you know it can sit in the fridge great for open sandwiches yeah can you use it for any sandwiches really any sandwiches but goes brilliantly well with pork now just have a little taste i've never had this before it's so

yeah so i'm gonna make a really nice fresh broccoli salad now these are called florets that's the best part of the broccoli okay the bit that everybody wants once they're off i'm going to slice the broccoli okay you ever had raw broccoli before it's always been cooked really when you dress this with the dressing it's incredible now a little seasoning early on yeah okay now for the dressing fresh yogurt in teaspoon of sugar please daddy a little small cider vinegar mmm there you go finely chopped shallot in with the broccoli so pernicious roasted almonds into the broccoli currants i love them that gives that nice sort of chewy texture all right lift up your bowl please nice and gently half of that in the middle please thank you and stop and then mix that up with me good girl a little taste

Gordon Ramsay's Ultimate Fit Food/Healthy, Lean...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, whether i'm doing a simple sponge cake or make an elaborate tart i want my bacon to be the best it can be so i always start with the best ingredients i can find knowledge is crucial the more you know personally about where your ingredients are from and how they produce the better [Applause] [Music] flour to get the low down on one of the key ingredients to brilliant baking it always pays to ask an expert and if there's one man who can really rise to the occasion it's professional miller mark able doing a job like this means that you end up thinking and living a flower if that's obsession i'm obsessed [Music] at his mill which has stood in norfolk since 1835 mark uses traditional stones to grind his flower so he really knows his stuff [Music] what actually comes off the field is something like this still husked still needs to be processed before we can actually mill it we then clean down to something like this which is ready to be milled [Music] all this is a great big machine which means you don't have to do it by hand rather than try and improve its performance by adding additional chemicals what we're trying to do is mill it in the best way to get that performance from it [Music] if you can put a seed in between stones you can make flour out of it it's that simple barley was what was traditionally used to make braid for people to live off oats can be used as well and of course good old spelt the great grandmother of modern wheats which has the most fantastic flavor and is because of its primitive nature the proteins in it are simpler so a lot of people can eat that they can't eat modern weight keep your eyes on the shelves look and see what is there and if something strikes you as being potentially interesting then get it and try it mix your own blend your hand together so that you can get the flavor that you want with the performance that you want [Music] mark's right different flowers perform and taste wildly different and so they're well worth trying out here's my quick guide to some of the flowers i like using strong flour is the one to choose for standard bread making the higher the protein content the crust your loaf will be the flour hailing from italy double zero it's super finely milled and perfect for pasta i like to use it for pizzas too because it produces a nice crispy crust like the one on my mozzarella and rosemary version rye flour will give you really dense fruity flavored bread fruit cakes or scones if it's too heavy for you just mix it with standard wheat flour and when you are baking remember that self-raising flour is just plain flour with raisin asians added so if you run out you can add baking powder and salt to your plain flour and get baking that's the real stuff that's it fresh flour straight out the mill is so superior in flavor and performance that uh it's only when you come to use it you realise what the difference is if you're going to experiment with ingredients in bacon you still need to follow some basic rules to make sure things turn out brilliantly every time kicking off with my simple soda bread first up measure out your dry ingredients plain flour wholemeal flour salt sugar and bicarbonate of soda [Music] mix get 450 ml of buttermilk pour most of it in and combined buttermilk has a wonderful subtle sour note that gives this bread a deliciously different taste you can get it in most of the big supermarkets if your dough's a bit stiff add the rest of your buttermilk flour your board gently knead the mixture for about 30 seconds until it's all combined dust your baking tray place your dough in the center and score a deep cross with a knife to get a perfect crust then simply bake in a preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes amazingly easy absolutely delicious and foolproof hot crusty homemade soda bread whenever you want my next no sweat bread recipe is even faster to make quick flatbreads with lemon thyme and ricotta for the dough mix first slice a leek lengthwise and chop and saute in a pan with olive oil and butter till tender season next combine flour with a pinch of seasoning and olive oil and mix in your cooked leeks bring the dough together in a bowl with a drop of warm water cover and rest for 20 minutes allowing the dough mixture to relax means the resulting bread will be nice and soft then dust the dough with flour mold into a sausage shape slice it into rounds [Music] and flatten with a rolling pin then simply fry in a hot dry pan [Music] when golden and crisp on each side remove for a simple supper served with a cottage cheese lemon zest and fresh thyme so simple so fast and so versatile flatbreads to die for next how to make one of the world's most popular bread-based foods fast mozzarella and rosemary pizza [Music] for the pizza dough add yeast to warm water put in a tablespoon of sugar and leave to one side in a separate bowl add sieve flour make a well and add your olive oil and yeast mixture get your hands right in to bring it together then knead for about 10 minutes on a floured surface until even and smooth put back into the bowl cover and leave in a warm place to prove once it's roughly doubled in size knock any excess air out [Music] place back on your surface divide your dough into four balls and simply flatten add olive oil to a hot pan and put in the pizza dough pizza is usually cooked in a seriously hot oven but this pan cook method works brilliantly as the dough starts to bubble and the base turns golden spoon over tomato passata which is sift tomatoes and tear in chunks of mozzarella then simply transfer to a hot grill until golden and bubbly finished with fresh rosemary i love this classic combination but you can easily adapt it and add your own favorite topping for a perfect pizza in minutes so simple so fast so irresistible three recipes they'll change the way you think about homemade bread forever beautiful sponge with fresh ginger bacon is part chemistry part imagination but you've got to rely on the rules for great results the only time you'll see me reaching for the scales first off eggs sugar butter and when i say weigh out the ingredients it does literally mean way out to the final gram 175 now 175 grams of sugar that's 350 grams in total cream the butter and the sugar to get a delicious light sponge start carefully on slow speed only speed up as the butter and sugar really start to cream together keep that really nice and light you can see how it's changed color so important at the beginning eggs in give me a little whisk adding one egg at a time stops the mix from separating second egg in third one in that's what we're looking for a really nice sort of light airy 80 texture now i'm going to flavor the sponge a little teaspoon of vanilla extract that perfumes the mix one teaspoon of baking powder that gives lightness 175 grams of flour and we're going to sieve it a to get rid of any lumps and b to keep it really nice and fine 175. we're not gonna beat that out we're just gonna lightly fold that in now what i'm looking for is a really nice loose dough that's looking a little bit too firm so just a little splash of milk a couple of tablespoons that relaxes the mixture down helps create that nice almost dropping consistency that's what i want just starting to drop take a non-stick loose bottom cake tin greasy with butter then coat it with flour to avoid the sponge sticking just give that a little shake make sure you get all the rim now just get the back of the spatula make sure you've got no peaks on my sponge to make sure the sponge bakes nice and evenly tap the tin a few times to knock out any air pockets that might have formed in the mixture now into the oven bake for 30 to 35 minutes at 180 degrees as that's cooking prepare the ginger cream for the center 300ml of cream give that a nice whisk whisking the cream by hand gives you so much more control and it's so easy to over whipped cream i want that nice light ginger cream in the center i don't want it grainy nothing worse when cream starts to separate now let's get into that three-quarter stage a little stiff peaks stop that for two minutes fresh ginger now get a really nice large slice of ginger smells incredible it's so fragrant green ginger is like sort of peeling a potato just take out all those little dark spots now get your grater you haven't gotten grater you can chop the ginger really finely i've got almost like a puree of ginger going through but the juice as well take your knife and just scrape all that taste it's incredible it's fragrant and it's not sweet it's got a really nice taste set that in the fridge [Music] smells incredible run a knife around the outside to ensure the cake doesn't stick to the tin before turning it out now get your hands under push up and out while your cake cools i'm gonna do like a really nice sweet chocolate coating pour 300 mils of double cream into a saucepan add two tablespoons of golden syrup to make the top nice and glossy then whisk chop this up really thinly so as it melts quickly 50 grams of butter that's gonna give the chocolate a really nice shine ball your cream and mix it in give that a really good stir as the chocolate the butter melts it thickens like how shiny that is so nice to finish something sweet on top topping done time to build your sponge cake look at the halfway mark there and just gently slice and really take your time all the way through lift it's delicious that nice big dollop in the middle don't be stingy they'll be tight with a cream another dollop on top spread that very carefully lift the lid and just sit there on top that's why i start off with a little extra cream in there so i squash it down the cream just pushes out to the side i'm not finished pour the luxurious chocolate topping over the sponge be generous and make sure the cake is coated thoroughly to give it a gorgeous finish get the bottom of the ladle and spread whoa one more [Music] whoa you know when to say stop when something looks that delicious i just want to dive in there [Music] you

If you...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, first up eggs bait in hash browns the secret of a great hash brown are the potatoes i prefer using really nice waxy potatoes they cook better but more importantly hold themselves together we're not gonna slice the onion all the potatoes but we're actually gonna grate them the potatoes get really nice and crispy i mean seriously crispy now the onion that way you get that nice balance of that onion flavor running through every little shard of potato [Music] season with salt pepper olive oil and km give that a really good mix through and then squeeze all that water out and look at all that juice we squeeze out there really important the more liquid you remove the crispier your hash browns will be nice large pan put that on once the pan's hot pour in a good glug of olive oil [Music] that sound confirms how important it is to have your pan nice and hot so it seals the grated potato onion together so take the spoon and just pat it down what we're trying to do now is get it really nice and compact going around the outside of the pan with little flecks of butter you just slip them down the back gently and that gets the onions caramelised here's a great tip for turning your hash browns over quick and easy take a plate place it on top and just flip it over and then slide it back in very quickly you see the color we've got on there now got that nice crispy texture of the potato i'm going to use the hash brown as a bed for my baked eggs crack in your eggs nice and gently just a little sprinkling of the cayenne to make the eggs a little bit spicy then into a preheated oven for six to eight minutes meanwhile onto my bacon and i'm giving it a classic american twist now one thing i could never get my head around when i

are ready wow look at that beautiful just put your spatula underneath there onto your plate and that bacon sets beauty on top of the baked eggs and that hash brown underneath and you can see why the best breakfasts in the world are always in america [Music] this is an all-american superhero offer breakfast eggs baking hash browns with glazed bacon when it comes to cooking techniques barbecue is virtually a religion in america especially in the southern states down there the real barbecue pros use big open fire pits to get huge joints of meat super succulent and fantastically perfumed with smoke and spice so my ultimate american dinner has to include an amazing mouth in the mouth barbecue beef but i'm doing it the easy way cooked in the oven low and slow we're creating barbecue style beef brisket with crunchy coleslaw and sweet potato wedges which will be right up her street holly now you love barbecues right so you're gonna help me barbecue this delicious piece of brisket brisket

even vegetable stock once the stock has come to the boil cover tightly with foil and just pinch in the ends fat that down and then you just twist all the way so that's nice and tight that's the hard work done thank you simply pop it in the oven for three and a half hours and as it cooks you can get on with the side dishes first job sweet potato wedges with some serious flavor start by making a spice mix in a dry pan toast coriander seeds until beautifully aromatic then put them in a pestle and mortar add salt and grind [Music] next smoked paprika dried oregano cayenne pepper and mix spice

If you liked this clip check out the rest...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, birch muesli traditionally gets made the night before and left in the fridge i find that a little bit too heavy and slightly stodgy so it's the same principles but a lot lighter first thing the yoghurt i think live and raw milk yogurt are best they're packed with calcium enzymes and probiotics which help your body absorb nutrients it's interesting because the kids especially would prefer their muesli with milk but the yoghurt so much better for them i like making it literally 10 minutes before i want to serve it because it doesn't become stodgy yogurt in apple juice that's a great way of sweetening the muesli a couple of tablespoons in give that little mix now sprinkle in the oats i like putting two thirds in now to absorb and almost double in size and the last third of oats in at the end oats are low on the glycemic index which means they slowly release energy to keep you going right through to lunch i quite like it when it just falls off the spoon you can see literally in seconds it's got thicker the rest of the oats in so i've got different textures now mix that up nicely and it literally takes three or four minutes to put together let's get a dry pan on almonds incredibly healthy toasting them even better flavor flake them into the pan lightly toast them that gives a really nice sort of crunch to the top of the muesli [Music] roll them around the pan so they're evenly toasted out into a bowl the exciting thing about putting your own music together is that you're in control blackberries summer raspberries strawberries and so it changes berries don't just taste great they're packed with antioxidants and vitamins c and k so just dot the top of your muesli with your blackberries generous on the blackberries sweetness tartness acidic and then just sprinkle over your nice almonds i quite like a lot of crunch on top so be generous that looks fantastic perfect way to start the day my quick birch and muesli doesn't just taste incredible it makes you feel fantastic it's my ultimate healthy breakfast there really is no better way to start the day [Music] a healthy diet is an important one but we're pretty relaxed about it my philosophy is simple try and eat less of the bad stuff and eat more of the good stuff and joining me in the kitchen is my netball nut youngest tilly for dinner it's amiga rich teriyaki salmon with a bug wheat soba noodle salad brimming with healthy greens and a light apparel spritz jelly for dessert first job the teriyaki marinade for the salmon tilly gonna help daddy with the salmon please right teriyaki delicious sticky sweet salmon okay first of all i'd like you a little season on the salmon please with salt and pepper thank

kitchen gives you food in a budget that tastes a million bucks first up my flavor-packed lamb with fried bread whether i'm cooking high-end dishes or rustic dishes trust me it all has to be impressive so this lamb dish proves that you don't have to spend a fortune to create delicious food first off put the pan on this is a lamb steak and it's cut just above the leg just here because you can see that delicious bone running through the center and that's full of marrow so that just gives the lamb a nice added sweet flavor just take your knife cut through each end this stops the lamb steak from buckling so therefore it cooks evenly and colors beautifully salt and pepper lamb needs quite a lot of help with the pepper so be quite generous with the pepper and just pat that down the pan is just under smoke on the outside now put the oil in get that pan really nice and hot because this is a cheap cut so i'm depending on the color of the lamb steak to really sort of impart a lot of flavor that's the noise you want to hear you can't hear that noise don't drop a steak in put a little bit of garlic in there not chopped garlic just whole cloves the garlic lightly crushed don't even waste time peeling them in tongs lift up that bit of fat around the back that's the top of the leg tilt the pan and let all that fat render rendering is a chef's term that means melting the fat it works brilliantly when you're cooking a rib eye as well turn it over that color beautiful now it looks like an expensive cut and we've got that nice even sear all over as it's cooking just tilt the pan and vase and basting the lamb steak just means you're sort of adding all that nice scented garlic olive oil back into the lamb diesel now take the lamb out let the lamb restaurant [Music] now for the perfect rustic crouton so this bread's quite firm a couple of days old just slice it straight down the center dice it up put it into a bowl season it beautifully from there i'm gonna add some milk sounds strange adding milk to crouton but it just gives it that nice rich creamy texture and just let that milk sort of absorb into the bread while that's soaking i'm gonna make the dressing go back to that initial garlic that was in the pan look at that beautiful into the pest and water and chives anchovies go brilliantly well with lamb i want that nice salty vinegary flavor and a bit of kick some capers the little baby cats very sweet now just pound that to a nice paste that smells incredible next some dijon mustard a nice teaspoon and a half in a little bit of red wine vinegar two tablespoons and then our extra virgin olive oil now it's got that heat in there i've got a nice roasted garlic a real hearty chunky vinaigrette that sort of seeps into that lamb some fresh parsley crunch up the parsley delicious flavor parsley in nice now get your pan hot for the croutons olive oil in the pan grab the croutons and squeeze all that excess milk out not too hard i don't want them dry and in and then just fry them and the milk inside these croutons give it a nice spongy creamy delicious flavor that's the color i want nice now take them out and lightly drain them a little bit of kitchen roll onto the board out a plateman just take this amazing vinaigrette and spread it get those croutons listen to them like little boulders hitting the plate the lamb let's sit that one next one on the rest of the croutons on now use all those little bits and my chef in paris would kill me right now if you saw me using those because they're the ugly scraps that customers should never see but but they're the best bits croutons on and then just drop that sauce on all those little bits of the lamb and there that is a perfect way of taking a cheap cut into the premier league of dishes for dishes that always pack a punch without costing a fortune simple and cheap delicious ingredients like sausages are great and you don't need a lot of them to get stunning dishes that taste incredible so spend your money wisely and you can have amazing midweek meals that don't cost the earth my next recipe is all about great flavors and it's as cheap and easy to make as it is delicious spicy sausage rice whatever you're cooking the secret to making great food is to ensure you're locking every last ounce of flavor in that pan and this spicy sausage rice does exactly that [Music] take these spicy sausages and pierce that skin because i want all that delicious spicy sausage meat out of this casing and you get more flavor from the sausage when you take them out the casing sausage is ready turn on the gas bread onion less acidic than a big white spanish onion and a lot more flavoursome tablespoon of olive oil a tablespoon only because i want all that fat coming out the sausages to sort of really help flavor the onions onions in and the onions go in first because you can never rush cooking an onion it's really important to sort of give them five to six minutes in the pan so you can really start to caramelize them and now for my pepper slice around wasting nothing i want to see that sort of little core those pips in the center no fine diced pepper the rice is going to be cooking for 20 minutes so i want the veg to sort of have texture after it's cooked peppers in a bit of garlic two nice cloves just slap down off of the shell garlic in now i want to turn up the gas get the pan nice and hot because the minute that sausage goes in everything cools down and you'll end up boiling the peppers and the onions of the garlic so heat up to maximum and then just make a well in the center in now start stirring quickly this is where you get so much more bang for your buck out of sausages because the skins off and the real flavor of that spicy italian sausage is going to come through what's great about this recipe is that you can use any type of sausage to get the flavor and the heat you want i've gone for the spicy italian but it's just as good with merguez or sweet so a teaspoon paprika in give it that really nice smoky flavor rice in and we're gonna sort of basically sear the rice we call it in the kitchen blasting the rice where we sort of soda the rice for 30 seconds and it takes on all that flavor next white wine so the wine sort of deglazes the pan and washes all that flavor from the bottom of the pan into the rice stock in bring it up to the boil turn it down and let it simmer [Music] double stop to rice turn that gas down and let it simmer for 12 to 15 minutes and just give it the occasional stir keep an eye on it now get ready to finish it slice spring onions diced sweet juicy tomatoes and roughly chop earthy flat leaf parsley spring is in tomatoes in off with the gas really important otherwise everything becomes overcooked flat leaf parsley in but look at the volume in that pan now that is an amazing way to take spicy italian sausages to a completely different level [Music] beautiful you

If you liked this clip...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, keeping it simple in the kitchen doesn't mean you can't have amazing food that not only looks incredible but tastes fantastic too my first recipe is so easy it removes the stress from cooking and it's a pleasure to make chili beef lettuce wraps cooking should never be a chore the more you cook the more confident you become that way you actually start to enjoy it and that's the key to good cooking have a bit of fun along the way this is minced beef and minced pork the pork needs to sit in there otherwise the beef's gonna dry out it's really important to season the mince before you cook it pan nice and hot a touch of olive oil [Music] mince in breaking up like that really helps to sort of separate it so we can fry it off with a lot of color with your spoon just go through and start breaking that up the most important thing to remember is mince is made up of cheap cuts brisket belly short rib so it needs help and frying off the mince for color is so important if this pan wasn't hot your mince is going to boil it's a horrible gray color on there and there's no flavor on your mince taste a little bit [Music] tastes delicious it's seasoned beautifully see how crispy it's going take it much further than you ever taken mince before nice and crispy smells incredible i'm draining it it's crucial it keeps the mints nice and crispy let me get rid of that excess fat that's lovely now just wipe out the pan then wash it low gas now we're gonna add texture to the mince finely chopped chili ginger garlic and spring onions spring onions give this sort of mince a really nice freshness because it just gives that crunch nice and thinly now i'm gonna fry off the chilis the ginger the garlic first sesame seed oil teaspoon only in garlic chili ginger in fry that off nicely the sesame seed oil just lifts up the whole flavour brown sugar that starts to really caramelize the chili the garlic and the ginger mince in now my fish sauce that gives it the saltiness you can see now why it's so important to get that mince really crispy because nothing's going soggy staying really crispy fresh lime that makes the mince fragrant and then lime juice roll it and squeeze that in there incredible i've got the salty i've got the heat i've got the sweetness now i've got the acidicness as well and then finally my spring onions in right at the last minute so i've got crunch in there as well smells amazing literally cook the mince now with sort of 30 seconds to go off and take it out [Music] looks incredible smells so inviting [Music] to go with the chili beef i'm making a simple sweet and spicy dipping sauce so everyone can dress the crispy mince to their own taste dipping sauce a little teaspoon the brown sugar soy sauce gives it a nice sort of dark rich color sesame seed oil a tablespoon and just top that up with a tablespoon of olive oil that stops the sesame seed all becoming too rich a teaspoon of fish sauce and then a touch of chili leave the seeds in again i want the heat in that sauce so impressive and amazing show off centerpiece lime juice in in the coriander chop it through once give that little mix up just check the seasoning that's lovely nice and rich now the lettuce i'm going to use baby gem because it's really nice and durable and sort of quite strong so you just sort of sit these nice trimmed lettuce leaves around now the exciting part to serve take your lettuce up spoon in your mince and then a little touch of dressing just a little drizzle nice and that's the secret of having good easy relaxed food is that you just help yourself food that looks and tastes a million bucks doesn't have to be complex this dish is as fun to cook as it is to eat [Music] spicy tuna fish cakes i love this recipe why because it turns this humble ingredient a can of tuna into something delicious just open up and drain the tuna into a sieve just lightly flake that don't press it too hard otherwise you'll dry out the tuna now these are water chestnuts just slice them nice and thin you can buy them anywhere any supermarket chestnuts in fresh ginger get rid of that rough skin on the outside by grating the ginger you get to get all that really nice sort of juice in take your spring onions and just slice on an angle i like the texture of the water chestnut with a spring onion or touch of fresh coriander lovely next remove the seeds from a chili to reduce its heat without losing any flavor and finely chop chili's in kaffir lime leaves roll them up nice and tight run your knife down the center once and just chop and that makes the fish cake nice and fragrant touch of salt a touch of pepper fish sauce just lightly season the tuna to bind all those wonderful ingredients two whole eggs and give that a nice little whisk and then add your eggs get your hands in there and start mixing get the mixture roll it hand to hand and the palm pat them down nicely to cook add a little ground oil to a hot pan at the face of a clock i'm going to go from 12 all the way around first one in these fish cakes only take a few minutes to cook so keeping track of the order they go in the pan means you know which one to turn first [Music] give the pan a nice gentle little shake make sure that nothing's sticking to the bottom spatula two fingers on top turn them over beautiful that crackling noise is something you always want because the tunes are already cooked so we just lightly frying them and get a nice crisp outside and gently take them out smell incredible let them sit there we're gonna make a really nice delicious simple dipping sauce start off a little pinch of sugar fish sauce two tablespoons that gives it the saltiness one tablespoon of rice wine vinegar and some fresh lime juice squeeze all that lime in there your fresh coriander lots of coriander and then give that a little mix and then you have the most amazing spicy tuna fish cakes who would have thought something as delicious as that can come out of a can a simple supper in minutes that's so mouth-wateringly easy and delicious you're guaranteed to cook it again and again green papaya salad this is a great salad to serve at a party it's delicious and robust enough to last the whole evening without wilting first off these are a little dried shrimp you can buy them anywhere they smell almost sort of of the sea bed into the pestilence for this salad inspired by my travels across thailand i'm starting by making a wonderfully spicy paste a little salt in there in just break them up this paste is like a staple ingredient in thailand that's what we're looking for almost it's like a powder right next just one clove of garlic slice up the garlic and get that into the pest and water bird's eye chili incredibly hot powerful but wow it does give an amazing kick to the paste in to the mix now a couple of tablespoons of brown caster sugar that softens the blow with a chilli and then just to give that nice sour taste a little bit of hot water into this tamarind paste it's really tart but sweet paste one tablespoon in fish sauce now it's got that almost sort of pickly smell slightly salty but the flavor is intense two tablespoons in bring that together and give it a really good mix some lime juice in half another touch of tartness the paste is nice and thick and fragrant but it's got the heat the sourness the tartness incredible green papaya stand it up give it a little peel you can find green papaya and local asian shops and bigger supermarkets and as it doesn't work like more delicate veg it's perfect for robust salads like this i grate it look that's what i want these thin slithers next a nice rich sweet banana shalom [Music] nice some carrot carrot gives it another texture now little that and mix it [Music] finish that off with thai basil and fresh coriander thai basil is a much more fragrant basil it's stronger and it's slightly thicker as well like papaya and tamarind paste you can get thai basil in good supermarkets and independent asian stores but normal basil works well too next prepare the crunchy topping pan on and toast some peanuts chop the nuts but it gives a really nice crunch in they go roll them around the pan gas off and just stick them out now for the exciting part i'm going to dress the salad nice spoon of dressing in to the papaya mix that in and then finally a nice general sprinkling roasted nuts and that is one delicious very fragrant very robust green papaya salad so easy to make and guaranteed not to go limp a perfect party salad and with such incredible colors textures and bold exciting flavors it's sure to grab your guests attention for me the secret of a great brunch is fun and casual fuss-free cooking and everyone helping themselves this is the ultimate steak sandwich you want the rolls royce of beef it has to be fillet now season it beautifully i like to open up the top of the peppermill to increase the size of the pepper in the steak so it gives that bit of heat nice little chunks you just roll now nicely all the way around now slice the garlic in half pan nice and hot olive oil in [Music] hold the steak and just place it into the pan don't drop it at the front of the pan we're going to tilt the pan forward to cook the back of the steak dual purpose now roll it back and sear underneath next my garlic and roast that garlic thyme fry that time i want to hear it we're not looking for a lot of color because you're going to dry out the fill it so just one end turn it back down and steer the other end in lift up your time place it on top of the garlic there lift up your fillet and sit that on top of your garlic butter in take a spoon tilt the pan gently lift up and baste i've got that scented garlic thyme flavour the steak is going to cook evenly because it's sat on a little a little bed in the oven for 8 to 10 minutes [Music] pan on for the relish you think of a steak sandwich you think of a sort of nice heated tomato relish to make the relish finely dice a red onion three finger rule one in front two behind through and chop wow next roughly chop a chilli keeping the seeds in for extra heat start off with the olive oil into a pan onions chili [Music] generous with the olive oil i want a nice sort of rich silky relish from there take your tomatoes you can't just use red tomatoes but these yellow and red make the perfect combination now put your salt in and then roast those tomatoes off take a wooden spoon and just sort of break them up once the skins blister the whole tomato just starts to release all that really nice sweet texture a little teaspoon of cherry vinegar gives that nice acidic balance the sweetness of the tomatoes turn down the gas and just let them sort of stew perfectly now a steak sandwich would not be complete unless it had the most amazing mustard mayonnaise simply add three tablespoons of mayonnaise to three teaspoons of whole grain mustard now i've got the reddish almost down to like a really nice jam now i want to make that reddish a little bit more fragrant some basil slice it through sprinkle that basil in there [Music] beautiful look at this she is my crown jewels time to take it out smell is incredible just based one more time fill it touch is quite soft in the center so it's just coming up to mid-rare let it rest at the same time you cooked it it'll be nice and pink evenly throughout the steak to make my sandwich i'm going to char grill some sliced chipatta bread season it nicely just a little drizzle of olive oil i want to get that bread nice and crispy pan nice and hot bread in push it down smell is amazing that char sort of charcoal flavor once you've got those marks on the bread it just stops the bread from becoming soggy and look at this here it is stunning on slice it gently one beautiful slice wow it's nice and pink all the way through and the beef is so soft it's almost like slicing through butter let the knife do the work [Music] little bit of mayonnaise spread that the back of the spoon on both sides next lettuce take that beautiful slice of beef and then relish on top of that beef and just slice the sandwich in half beautiful now that's what i call a steak sandwich trust me serve the sublime sandwich for brunch and you'll put a smile on everyone's face you

If you liked this clip check...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, starting out as a young chef my biggest influence was definitely french cuisine and when i was 23 years of age i was determined to learn as much as i could so i set off for paris to work in some of the most demanding and exacting kitchens in the world and my passion and love for french food really took hold when i was living in france i got to know two very distinct traditions of french food on the one hand there was the delicious oil cuisine i cooked all day in the restaurant and on the other hand there was the food you ate in people's homes which is a lot simpler to make but still absolutely delicious my ultimate french-inspired lunch is very light bright and really takes me back to when i lived in paris it's my take on the salad nicoise serve with a delicious goat's cheese and pear tartine think of the nicoise as an assembly job of delicious ingredients brought together with a fantastic dressing the secret behind my salad nicoise is in the dressing room spoon dijon mustard into a pestle and mortar some people top the salad with anchovies and capers but in mine they're the base to the dressing we're gonna grind that to a paste and then get the garlic in there season well with black pepper it doesn't need any salt in there because of the anchovies add a couple of tablespoons of red wine vinegar olive oil and lastly flat leaf parsley to give the dressing freshness against those deep flavors it's a thick rich substantial dressing dressing done now for the salad ball potatoes green beans and eggs from a rolling ball seven and a half to eight minutes it should keep that nice yolky creamy texture in the center once the eggs are ready put them into cold water to stop them cooking and this is a great trick to peel them so much easier peeling eggs when you use the water that they've been cooling down in and the water will seep underneath all the shell so the whole shell just gets peeled off of one beautiful big layer now beans nice and crunchy season the beans and potatoes whilst they're still warm so they absorb more flavor a little drizzle of olive oil salt pepper and just let them sit there whilst the potatoes and beans cool down i'm doing a simple french open sandwich which is called a tartine this is delicious first i'm toasting baguette on the griddle lightly oil your griddle pan get your bread stick it on there take a pear it goes brilliantly well with goat's cheese slice the pear into finger width pieces that's the color we're looking for that dark crispy texture now for the ghost cheese give it a season it doesn't need salt because a little fresh goat cheese is already quite salty then a handful of crumbled walnuts they go under the grill whilst they put the tuna and these ones together my secret to assembling a great nisswa salad is to start in the middle of the plate and add ingredients layer by layer there's one thing i'm always missing the bottom of salad is dressing so i like to put it on the plate first baby gem lettuce is great because it's robust and holds that heavy dressing then add firm waxy salad potatoes and green beans i like them to have a bit of a crunch canned tuna can be fantastic i'm using a good quality one in olive oil which has been drained next baby plum tomatoes which have a lovely intense sweet flavor and then my eggs that nice dark rich yolk beautiful yolk's still creamy inside he's a little olive nicoise this will work just as well with other black olives and then your dressing drizzle that round gently beautiful that is a nicoise in heaven now tartine wow just a smell of those grilled walnuts that is beautiful a simple but very elegant tuna nicoise with a delicious ghost cheese sandwich wonderful [Music] my vibrant and gutsy nisswa salad with that incredible anchovy and caper dressing served with a pear and goat's cheese tartine too good to let the french keep all to themselves [Music] tilly would you mind helping daddy with the chicken fricassee please we're gonna start off with browning all the chicken off nicely pan on get that nice and hot what i want you to do for me first is to season the chicken with salt and pepper please thank you so that's on one side then we turn the chicken over so we season it on the other side salt good girl and pepper nice now this is almost like a chicken stew okay what's that there [Music] time time good girl what's that one there that one that's right rosemary and because this is quite a rustic french dish we don't need to chop everything so you get the garlic and you just bash it like that now smell mmm that's right so that's nice and hot put a tablespoon of olive oil in there a couple of lugs one two good girl put the chicken in it and you lay away you're like nice and brown i'm getting good at this you are skin side down so we got the color on the skin now just want you to cut the mushrooms in half the belly please okay these are chestnut mushrooms there are lots of different kinds of mushrooms out there there are lots and lots of different types of mushrooms which one's your favorite one of my favorites is the giro mushroom i like mushrooms that are a bit bigger than this and um some dinners with mum we cut out the middle put pesto and cheese in it and then we bake them uh-uh i want you to sprinkle the pancetta over the chicken please good girl nice mushrooms not yet because i'm gonna get some color on the chicken first okay and as that pancetta starts to cook down it puts a really nice flavor on the chicken yeah so we're sort of sauteing everything okay all right garlic in please good girl just throw them in and i want you to sprinkle the mushrooms on top of that good girl and then there's the rosemary you can get your fingers like that and you pull it down you take it all off hold it put it down good girl so now you've got the nice little rosemary sprigs and we do the same with the thyme now the time flower is a little bit smaller what different flavors do they give so the time is a little bit sweeter okay and the rosemary a little bit more savoury which one do you like i like them both because they both get a nice smell don't they so they leaf in i'd like you to put that rosemary and thyme in there please lovely sprinkle it over right i'd like you to stand back now because i'm gonna flambe this i do not want to get those little slippers caught on fire what are the names rumpel and judy julia nice okay great ready yeah in with a brandy and then just tilt the pan gently whoa whoa how cool is that magical beautiful bit like a cauldron all the cognac has been flambe so there's no raw alcohol anywhere so we've got a really nice deep rich flavor i'm gonna add my chicken stock you know rampo likes that not my slipper rumple run for the dog ah rumple the dog well he likes chicken stock yes when he's a good boy he gets um he gets it in his um with his biscuit it's gone in like wow really quickly simmer and reduce the stock for around 10 minutes now we're going to cook the most amazing potatoes soda potatoes are really simple to make and absolutely delicious start by slicing the potatoes into finger whipped pieces then parboil them for five to six minutes when you cook something like rosemary or thyme or basil does it slowly let off the flavor into the bottle very much so in a hot pan add a tablespoon of goose fat and saute the potatoes until they turn golden and add in shallots garlic rosemary and thyme that goes in over top and that goose fat now is starting to fry the potatoes you just leave that sat there to complete my ultimate french dinner my version of a classic a glorious lavender creme caramel for dessert the first job is the lavender sugar you can buy this ready-made or simply add dried edible sprigs of lavender to caster sugar and store you can also try this trick with vanilla pods and cinnamon to bring new subtle flavors to sweets and bacon [Music] for the creme caramel melt plain caster sugar until it turns dark golden pour into ramekins sprinkle with lavender flowers and cool now to make a simple custard gently heat whole milk in a pan until steaming meanwhile whisk together egg vanilla seeds and lavender sugar until golden and fluffy then gradually pour the hot milk into the mix whisking continuously until the custard is smooth and creamy to set cook in a water bath or bamboo a good tip is to line a roasting tin with a cloth to stop the ramekins jiggling around pour your custard then boiling water around the ramekins until halfway up the sides then cook in a preheated oven for around 30 minutes until set cool in the fridge then when you're ready to serve dip the ramekins in hot water to loosen the creme caramel [Music] ebola lavender

beef short ribs because i love their firm texture and nutty taste but there's a huge range of other mushrooms that are great for slow cooked dishes and when it comes to buying them there's one expert green grocer who's a fountain of knowledge borough marcus fred foster he started off on the memphis dead still in pimlico really he had a salad stall with other 20 years of experience he could actually write his own mushroom encyclopedia mushrooms as soon as you pick them the moisture starts coming out of them so you need to buy them when they're fresh certain products you smell for flavour and they tend to be fruits mushrooms don't smell nice at all they smell kind of metallic really so you have to use your eyes as your guide of what you buy with mushrooms really really important wild mushrooms are literally grown wild in the forest they're just quality wherever they are this is morel mushroom a fantastic product so hard to find in the world it's almost got an apricoty type of flavour earthy woody and of course as you cook it the flavour increases for extra flavor and texture highly prized morels are ideal when added to slow cooked stews and casseroles as are the trumpet de la more which have a deliciously rich flavor another wild type to try is the chanterelle its subtle fruity flavor is delicious and perfect fried with butter parsley and garlic when you're dealing with wild mushrooms you need to clean them it can be quite a slow process it's with a soft brush don't don't use water never use water with mushrooms it deteriorates the mushroom rapidly oyster mushrooms are very meaty mushroom just a lovely silky smooth flavour really nice how do you tell whether it's fresh those gills are bright never cut an oyster mushroom always tear it look at the whiteness of that beautiful that would be grey if it was old although also found wild oyster mushrooms are more commonly cultivated along with a similar type the enoki their delicate taste is great in salads and soups finally fred saved the best until last and of course the pinnacle is the truffle they are really really sought after the smell is so intense that smell it's hard to describe because it's such a unique smell the more expensive the truffle the more intense the smell so that's why you use such a small amount on a dish it's amazing the way they get these they used to use pigs of course they don't do that anymore they use dog steel but because the pigs used to eat them all this magical tasting fungi is by weight one of the most expensive foods in the world it's phenomenal eaten raw shaved over pastel or risottos or drizzle of truffle or turn slow cooked stews into something out of this world people are actually scared of mushrooms aren't they so it's amazing really they shouldn't be because take away the fear and just close your eyes and taste them they're just amazing they are amazing [Music] slow cooking is a brilliant way of getting lots of extra depth and intensity into your dishes the secret is to lock in all those flavors at the start and let the ingredients do their thing as it cooks these are beef short ribs and there's basically five to six bones across there and as the short rib cooks it sticks that bone the bone implants flavor and the meat just sort of melts cooks slowly gives it that nice level intensity slice alongside the bone straight down you can see that marbling that sort of disappears and disintegrates i'm cooking them in a roasting tray get it on the heat until nice and hot season these short ribs beautifully olive oil in bone on the top we'll start coloring that in [Music] really important to give the beef short ribs a really nice sear if you didn't brown the meat off it goes in the oven and it looks like boiled meat so you really want that nice dark rich coloring just cut the garlic in half slide that down the side that's going to give that beef an amazing flavor [Music] to give body to the sauce stir in a heaped teaspoon of tomato puree i'm just hitting the bottom of the pan with that tomato puree and we call it cooking out that smell of puree otherwise it just goes in there raw and it gives this sort of tartness to the braised short ribs red wine in don't use an expensive bottle of red wine there's no need bring the wine up to the boil and reduce it this burns off the alcohol and concentrates the flavor makes a big difference when you reduce the red wine down by half because it gives that nice dark rich intensity look at my garlic that is just gonna sweeten everything up incredible stock in beef stock perfect chicken stock fine just to about an inch underneath the beef short ribs bring it up to the ball to lock in all that flavor as the beef ribs slow cook cover them so they braised from the bottom and steamed from the top into the oven two and a half hours 170 to 180 degrees in she goes the great thing about slow cooking is you do most of the work in advance and then put your feet up five or ten minutes before the beef short ribs come out of the oven start your garnish this is light cured pancetta we want nice thick nice big thick sticks of crispy bacon [Music] these are delicious chestnut mushrooms i'm not going to slice them i'm just going to cut them in half but look at the color on those lardons now all the whites raw fat have disappeared the lardons have shrunk right down and all we've got there now is the proper bacon mushrooms in beautiful so the mushrooms get seasoned from the bacon i'm pan frying these separately to the beef so they remain crisp and have a different texture [Music] leave that to cool down now this is like christmas day for me when you unwrap that fall once you see what's underneath it [Music] wow they smell incredible lift and place on your tray beautiful to make a fantastic rich deep sauce press the soft roasted garlic through a sieve into the cooking juices all that nice pureed garlic coming through there because that is going to make the most amazing flavor scrape all of that off the sieve nice then just start sieving all that lovely brazing liquor in that smells delicious take your sauce and just glaze do them individually they deserve that respect spoon on your bacon and your mushrooms beautiful be generous with these mushrooms i'm telling you they taste amazing flat leaf parsley all that freshness over those amazing ribs incredible never ever be embarrassed about going to your butcher and asking for cheap cuts because the results are incredible amazing beef braised short ribs with bacon and mushrooms it's mushroom and leek pasta this fantastic fast and simple pasta dish made with everyday ingredients just goes to prove you can eat good food whenever you want really important put the water on first so you can just have it gently swimming away ready for the pasta while the water comes to the boil start the sauce by slicing mushrooms first off fingers one in front two behind up and down then add olive oil to a hot frying pan [Music] i want that nice color on the mushrooms off the heat literally 10 seconds and when you toss something really important you get all the ingredients at the end of the pan push down and pull back that noise that's that's all the water coming out of the mushrooms next finely chop a fat clove of garlic [Music] then prepare your leeks just take your knife and go down through the center turn it over and again into quarters see all that opening up and then just rinse the top of that to get rid of any potential dirt or sand it just breaks up into nice little quarters add all that leek into those mushrooms beautiful and now the secret is to get rid of that water inside the leek as it cooks down all the water's gone you just left that really nice intense flavor garlic's got nice and crispy now we're going to add a touch of chicken stock in there beautiful lasagna sheets i'm just going to drop the sheets in to the water lasagna sheets are an unusual choice for a dish like this but they work brilliantly although any type of pasta you've got in the cupboard will do and just twist that pan that stops any pasta actually sticking to the bottom of the pan chicken start to reduce down by half and it's almost delays the bottom of the pan basically washed all that wonderful flavor off turn the gas down and add a couple of tablespoons of cream this just enriches the dish bring it back up to the bowl and let it simmer for three to four minutes now the secret with the pasta is just taking it out a little early so you've got that nice texture hold up the sheet and just nip it and you can feel your fingers in the center it's ready turn the sauce down and lay these beautiful sheets of lasagna into that sauce i'm just going to turn the gas off now and let the pasta sit in there and absorb that amazing sauce finish with chopped fresh tarragon it's a delicious herb it goes brilliantly well mushrooms and leeks just let that sit and almost sort of infuse to serve i'm making a quick bruschetta by toasting fresh chipata bread two nice slices drizzle that in olive oil a little bit of garlic just rub the bread the crust as well crust is what really takes that garlic now pan for the bread little touch of olive oil as it starts to smoke bread in [Music] but look at the pasta now it's been stained by that amazing sauce to serve i want a nice spoon of my mushrooms leeks and cream then i'll take my pasta just twist it and let it sit on top that tarragon has just lifted everything bread on and that's the beauty about something so simple they can be done in 20 minutes with everyday ingredients a stunning pasta dish adding easy and versatile dishes like this to your repertoire is what cooking at home is all about so you can always make great tasting food at the drop of a hat you

If you liked this clip check...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, today i'm taking my queue from italy a country that takes home cooking family and fresh vibrant flavors extremely seriously the italians are brilliantly using good food to bring people together as well as being delicious today's dishes are also really quick and easy to make leaving you more time to sit down and enjoy them with your friends and family fennel sausage frittata [Music] the exciting thing about frittata is the fact there's no set recipe because it's basically eggs whatever else you have left for me the secret of a good frittata is in the sausage nice hot pan onions in general from the onions heat nice and high season fennel seeds to give the onions a really nice flavor everyone's used to cooking sausages whole but it's a really nice way of using them to take them out of their thin skin what we're going to do is crumple all that wonderful spicy fennel sausage into the onions it's going to release all that flavor a lot quicker pretty important to keep that gas nice and high and the longer you can rise the sausage the more flavor you're gonna gain six whole eggs give your eggs a really good mix flat leaf parsley a staple in italian cooking chop it quite rough some parmesan it gives a really nice seasoning fresh pepper a little touch of salt and then get it in there when you fork through it so when you slice it no one's complaining they've got less sausage gonna make it even more italian by topping it with some buffalo mozzarella dry it and then slice it nice and thinly twist it mozzarella in and then finally finish it with pans and cheese get the top just as tasty as it is the bottom my frittata needs three and a half to four minutes under a red hot grill to achieve the best results always ensure your oven or grill are preheated to the perfect temperature she's ready this is the thing i love about italian cooking it's about sharing but always focusing on the ingredients look at that i mean it's incredible a little shake the pan to make sure it comes out and then spatula underneath and just leave it it's light fluffy and it smells incredible and that for me is a dream come true it's amazing how far you can take six eggs and two sausages wow spicy fennel sausage frittata my ultimate italian breakfast it's a cracking start to the day for my ultimate italian lunch i'm cooking scrummy sardines topped with a fragrant gremolata dressing but first a deliciously fresh orzo pasta salad this is one of the hidden delicacies of italian pasta also because 90 of the time it's always hidden in a soup or broth or minestrone and it looks like large grains of rice but once they absorb that water they double in size it's a pasta that needs a lot of help season it nicely a pinch of salt and splash of extra virgin olive oil fresh bay leaf into the boiling water and that bay leaf really helps to flavor the pasta give it a little pan a turn left and right that stops any pasta sticking to the bottom and the secret behind cooking any pasta is having a nice gentle rolling boil you just have the gas up where the outside of the pan is just rolling and all that also is tumbling over each other gently boiling pasta rapidly tends to destroy the outside texture it doesn't take the marinade or the vinaigrette or the sauce for the dressing parmesan twist of fresh pepper the zest of the lemon squeeze your lemon in there through your fingers to catch all those seeds bring that together with some extra virgin olive oil pine nuts taste delicious toasting them just elevates them after eight minutes my orzo is perfectly al dente drain it a little bit of cold water through it flows the cooking process down but stops it from going mushy it's the size of pumpkin seeds now a drizzle of olive oil and into the vinaigrette whilst it's still warm just above room temperature because the warmer the pasta the more it absorbs the vinaigrette and now some texture rocket not finely chopped and the fresh basil as well roll them up like a big fat cigar slice in half and then chop the basil for crunch just sprinkle the toasted pine nuts it looks like a plate of jewels glistens is a delicious very fragrant orzo pasta salad now the sardines incredibly healthy and absolutely delicious grilled never ever be intimidated on looking for fresh fish it's about the condition of the fish bright eyes fresh gills nice bright red interior and the firmness of the flesh almost you could stand the fish up on its own it needs to be that fresh the best way to get flavour into a sardine is to grill it light seasoning olive oil and just roll the seasoning around get your rosemary peel off a few of the little shards at the end so it's a little bit sharp push the rosemary in almost like you're threading makes them so much more flavoursome they'll be scared those fine little bones i remember growing up with sardines tin sardines you didn't turn your nose up at the bone once the griddle pan starts to smoke lightly drizzle and then sardines on two and a half to three minutes each side now for the gremolata a vinaigrette that sits beautifully well on the sardines freshly parsley just run the knife once there's nothing worse when you overchop parsley and all that delicious flavors let on the board the zest and juice of an orange and the lemon i'm gonna turn them now gremolata is about fragrance natural flavors brilliant for grilled meats as well little touch of salt and pepper and then olive oil just to bring it together the garlic i almost want to be like a secret weapon in there rate it bring that together you've got a very fresh clean gremolata almost if we're sat on the amalfi coast off and then whilst the sardines are still nice and warm and just thinly coat the gremolata i'd like the path in the garlic to sit on top and that's citrus from the lemon and the orange to sort of dive underneath you can see why italian cuisine rides on the freshest and the simplest execution they allow their ingredients to become the hero not the chef also salad we're stunning grilled sardines wherever you eat this dish it will fill your senses with the sun and the sea of the mediterranean delicious [Music] we're hoping to wow the family with an amazing quick fig jam crostini with creamy barata and the heart in maine are beef cheek ragu with poplar deli beef cheeks just think the size of your little cheeks yeah imagine the size of a cow with them and the cheek is right underneath here yeah um i want you to give them a really nice season with salt and pepper on there please so beet cheeks very cheap i cut that takes sort of a long time to cook yeah but give it a bit of love let it cook in the oven it comes out like a dream a little touch of oil in the pan what we want to do is get them really nicely colored shade see it into the pan oh cool layer wave see what that is um [Music] sitting at the dock of the the beach beach and then i want the onion chunky because i'm going to cook it for like three three and a half hours so you go down down down and then again there and there so it doesn't overcook so a really good color on the cheeks like that so how do you cook these at our restaurants if they take so long they go in the oven literally half past six seven o'clock in the morning three and a half four hours to be ready for lunch and the longer you leave them in their juices yeah and the cooking liquor the better three nice cloves of garlic good onions in and garlic in please nice where's your baby there it is get those onions and that garlic really nicely colored put the cheeks back in please right red wine in cool okay and the red wine is going to deglaze the pan so delays will basically sort of rinse all that flavor off the bottom of the pan yeah okay because that's going to make the most amazing sauce now you could use tomato puree but chopped canned tomatoes you'll make a much better sauce i'm going to top that with some stock so the secret of brazing is having little of the meat exposed and 90 percent of it submerged see them now yeah they're like little crocodile heads popping up out the water turn the gas off and leave the lid just off at the end there if we had to cover it completely the steam hits the top yeah the lid and all that water comes very important solar still that's right in the oven 140 150 for about three and a half to four hours good job boom we're gonna now do the fig and broader crostini oh okay let's take the figs we're gonna make a nice slightly spicy fig jam take off the tops yeah in half and each half into three sugar the touch of salt in there okay we're making a jam but we don't want to be too sweet and then these little babies what are they ah what's the shape stars star nice stanley's taken from the hennessy plant yeah when you dry them like that so intensifies the flavor really important to count how we put in there okay yeah so one two three four five so they're just there for a flavor and then you take them out that's right secret here let's get that camera going so when i hear of jam i don't think of caramel no but this is a very fast jam caramel's starting to color i want you very carefully to drop the fig's in there good so the juice out of the figs is starting to break down the caramel you know what that is well sweet vinegar i love that on my salad you've got that sort of sweet and sour flavor leave that cooking for three four minutes now let's slice our chipotle in italian crostini means little bits of toast but it can be made out of leftover baguette sourdough or any crusty open textured bread we're staying authentically italian with ciabatta season them and then drizzle a little touch of olive oil on there both sides really important because we're going to grill the bread push it down put some lovely take it off with the chipata toasted we need to carefully extract the star in these pods from our piping hot fig jam my jacket we've got one little bugger to find oh no is it there yes it is right now we've got the green light to crush some of the skin's disintegrated in that camel that looks so nice while jack carefully spreads the crostini with our hot fig jam i can unveil the last element to our starter the creamy italian speciality burrata a little money bags they can delicious this looks fun doesn't it we need to season them lightly drizzle over a little olive oil and dust them with lemon zest can you imagine that sat there and you tear some of it off and you stick it on top of that back to the main course to match our hearty beef cheeks i've chosen to use papridelli rule number one when cooking pasta salt in first salting first good olive oil in pasta in twist it round so you don't break it no bring that back up the ball that's gonna take about three or four minutes flat leaf parsley scrunch it up for me yeah and chop him now wait to see these beef cheeks beauties look at them oh look soft they're very soft tiny to taste that's so good oh jack you just dribbled on your jumper joke really right drain the pasta salt pepper pasta little drizzle of olive oil i want to put your fresh pasta nicely chopped nicely chopped in this is the magic bit okay you take a little ladle of the juice put that at the bottom and you put the pasta on top of that sauce honestly oh my gosh your sisters are gonna love you

If you...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, slow-cooked fiery lamb cooking's all about being bold and adventurous and this dish is exciting because it's slowly cooked and the longer it cooks the more flavoursome it becomes marinating the lamb first chili's we're going to use a mixture of red and green take off the tops and just slice in garlic crushed don't worry about chopping these ultra fine just get it in there cooking for up to three hours everything sort of blends and almost sort of purees itself together smoked paprika goes brilliantly well with the chillies two teaspoons in a touch of dried oregano some little cumin seeds the blend and the fragrance that they give out is extraordinary they release a little oil as well and helps to tenderize the lamb a touch of salt pepper cinnamon that sort of sweetens up the lamb olive oil just a tablespoon and the olive oil helps to sort of stick all those wonderful spices to the lamb jump in just start really rubbing at this stage you can leave the lamb to marinade for anything from half an hour to overnight allowing the spices to really penetrate the meat giving amazing results when you tuck in delicious vegetables carrots and onions and that's it sliced secret slicing vegetables for braising is not getting too thin you slice the onions too thin they burn you've got that horrible char taste on that slow braised grazing it's just a chef's term that means cooking in liquid on a low heat making the meat incredibly moist and beautifully tender so the secret of braising is having a really nice thick durable pan get that nice and hot just a touch of olive oil lamb in hold the bone because you're in control then into the pan i want that white fat to start rendering so it'll add more fat therefore making it a lot more flavoursome as it braises chili's cinnamon in mix that up and don't be scared you're not burning this you're sort of searing the lamb shanks and this is the important part right at the very beginning we're getting the color on the lamb which washes off as it braises in the oven so be generous with that color vegetables in wow and then a couple of baileys so now you lift the lamb up and get the lamb sat on top of the vegetables now just glaze the pan with red wine deglazing means that you're you're cleaning the bottom of the pan and you're getting that amazing flavor washed off and lifted up into that sauce can really transform that dish always delays then bring to the boil and cook for about 10 minutes to reduce the wine is reduced down by half now for the stock bring that stock back up to the ball and then into the oven now don't cover it when you cover it all the condensation comes off the lid your lamb becomes gray all this effort and that exciting spice gets washed away no lid and into the oven for three a hours cook on a low heat of 160 degrees gives the spices time to work and transform the meat so it's mouthwateringly tender now look at those out on to a plate you can just see that meat sliding down juicy and then creamy tender grab it by the shank roll around that rich delicious sauce look at that and get your sauce nice beautiful just get some mint don't chop it just pick that fresh mint and let it snow and there you go a very spicy delicious melting of the mouth lamb shank amazing when you're cooking for a special occasion you want to nail some key things one your recipes need to be bulletproof you don't want a disaster on the big day two as well as tasting phenomenal they have to be easy to serve so you can relax and enjoy yourself three when you're out to impress food needs to look great too my first recipe fits the bill perfectly stuffed lamb with spinach and pine nuts stuffed meats are perfect for special occasions they look impressive taste amazing but more importantly they are so simple to do pan on for the stuffing it's a saddle of lamb basically a sort of rolls-royce cut perfectly shaped and it suits stuffing to an absolute tea for the stuffing finely chop an onion garlic nice thin slices oil in onions and garlic in salt and pepper make sure the stuffing is beautifully seasoned so it helps to season the inside of the lamb now we've got the color on those onions we're gonna throw in some pine nuts and that helps to give a bit of a texture here's where it starts getting really exciting spinach in and just lay the spinach over the pine nuts it looks like a lot of spinach that's gonna condense and disappear almost instantly there's so much more flavor and spinach when you saute it as opposed to steaming it or boiling it gas off look at that now to bring that together no eggs no breadcrumbs crumpled feta over the spinach feta cheese adds a beautifully salty sharp and creamy flavor what this does it brings our stuffing together now open up the lamb keep those little fillets to the side that's the channel that we want to stuff so i want to just open that up a little bit there salt and pepper lightly and before we put our stuffing in we're going to season it with soon sumac is a wonderful lemony spice that goes brilliantly with lamb and you can get it in most big supermarkets and it sort of cuts through that thick rich sweetness of the lamb open up that lamb there take a spoon if you're preparing this for the day ahead then let the stuffing cool down it's inevitable when you start rolling it and tying it something's gonna squeeze out so load up the ends take these beauties these little fillets and just support that stuffing and sort of increase that beautiful tunnel and then from there over there and bring that towards you and then roll like i said some of the stuff is going to come out now to tie it first off around the side and don't worry about some flash butcher's not just tie it one in the middle you can get butcher string from your local butcher or at cookware shops i got two ties go too tight it just forces all that stuffing out of the lamb when it's in the oven nice now we just season the top of it roll the joint to make sure all the skin gets seasoned now you think normally that just goes in the oven like that that's how my mum would do it but get your tray onto the gas oil in get it really nicely colored none of your stuffing is coming out the sides really important look at that color beautiful does kickstart the roasting process gas off into the oven cook for 45 to 55 minutes depending on how pink you want your lamb lift the lamb out of the fat to rest resting it raised up in the tin will stop it cooking but not cool it down too quickly and means you won't lose any of those lovely juices next i'm making a simple but sophisticated accompaniment for the lamb top and tail the cucumber peel it cut the cucumber into three and just core taking out all that it's just sort of watery seedy and it spoils the flavor slice cucumber cucumber in really nice way of making a cheap and cheerful cucumber look glamorous we're gonna dress that cucumber with a nice fresh yogurt couple of tablespoons next some fresh mint dressing a touch of salt a touch of pepper and then pomegranate molasses that just sweetens it up finish that with lemon mix that up lamb it's rested carefully take off the string and then just gently pull them back a straighted-edge knife that's going to cut through that crispy fat on the outside instantly i tied it purposely so i can get my portion control from the lines hold it nice and firmly look at your line where the string was and look this one is going to be amazing lay and down just in those two slices there it proves that stuffing for special occasions because that is a saddle of lamb at its absolute best stuffing meats and fish not only makes them look fantastic it also gives them an extra added flavor dimension too once you've mastered the technique you'll be able to turn out dishes that will guarantee you'll have an unforgettable feast you

long way my favorite bacon is traditional cured italian pancetta rich and strong in flavor it brings extra depth to salads stews and soups but a great cheap alternative is streaky bacon and it's what i'll be using for my thrifty lunch smoky bacon onions potatoes sweet corn it's amazing how cheap the ingredients are that go into this get your bacon and just cut into nice chunks i want these nice bite-sized pieces smoky chunky and just absolutely delicious it's almost like an american corn chowder potatoes give it starch thickness sweet corn gives it that glossy delicious flavor a couple of baileys they're always hanging around if they're not in your cupboard they're on someone's drive so ask to borrow them they are so powerful and it goes brilliantly well with the onions and the bacon bay leaves in a couple of potatoes it's incredible how far you can stretch something out especially when you bulk it with potatoes slice them and dice them nice and chunky soups are a fantastic way to use up leftover veg or meat that might otherwise go to waste and if you make it in bulk freeze it in individual portions and save on lunches throughout the week so you can see already how hearty and robust the soup is it's a delicious combination onions bacon potatoes and now some fresh leaks open up the leak into four give that a nice wash licks often have soil left in their tops so it's important to clean them thoroughly start sweating that down we haven't even got a corn in there yet and already it's looking and smelling incredible add salt but remember you've got bacon in there which is salty so proceed with caution really important to sweat those potatoes off i love getting that flavor from the smoky bacon in with the potatoes now once the leek is sweated off creamed corn a popular side dish in the states creamed corn is made from fresh frozen or even tinned corn cooked with onion butter and cream and can be bought ready made that starts to give the foundation the soup half the creamed corn add the sweet corn then your stock don't flood the soup just bring the stock to underneath the ingredients you can always add very difficult to take away homemade chicken stock is so cheap to make just boil up your roast chicken bones with a few fresh veg and freeze in batches for when you need it lighten the load with a touch of milk that gives a really nice bright color now bring that up to the ball turn it down and let it simmer for 12 to 15 minutes as it cooks slowly the starch thickens the soup the bacon renders and that leek onion starts to puree and the corn just shines okay next we're going to make the american cheese biscuits in the uk they're known as scones but in america they're called biscuits [Music] [Applause] first put plain flour into a sieve add baking powder and sift both into a bowl next add some salt pepper and grated mature cheddar cheese mix the dry ingredients then make it well in the center pour in double cream and gently combine with a wooden spoon turn your dough out onto a floured surface and knead for a few seconds only if you overwork it your cheese biscuits won't rise roll out your dough to about two centimetres thick and cut into four centimeter round biscuits [Applause] place well apart on a lined baking sheet and leave to rest on the tray for about 10 minutes then brush the top of each biscuit with melted butter and bake for about 30 minutes at 160 degrees c in a preheated oven when your cheese biscuits are well risen and a beautiful golden brown remove deliciously moorish served hot or cold time to dole out my thrifty lunch i always like to leave a soup to stand or rest it looks richer it gets rid of all the stock i like to have two thirds ingredient one third of the stock so it looks like a nice delicious chunky soup into the bowl [Music] beautiful tin sweet corn a leek potato and some streaky bacon but it doesn't look like it's just coming out of a stalker but that is proper hearty food [Music] served with my american style cheese biscuits this thrifty lunch may have been made on a shoestring but without an ounce of compromise on freshness and flavor [Music] the secret of a great hash brown are the potatoes i prefer using really nice waxy potatoes they cook better but more importantly hold themselves together we're not gonna slice the onion all the potatoes but we're actually going to grate them the potatoes get really nice and crispy i mean seriously crispy now the onion that way you get that nice balance of the onion flavor running through every little shard of potato [Music] season with salt pepper olive oil and km give that a really good mix through and then squeeze all that water out and look at all that juice we squeeze out there really important the more liquid you remove the crispier your hash browns will be nice large pan put that on once the pan is hot pour in a good glug of olive oil [Music] that sound confirms how important it is to have your pan nice and hot so seals the grated potato onion together so take the spoon and just pat it down what we're trying to do now is get it really nice and compact go around the outside of the pan with little flecks of butter you just slip them down the back gently and that gets the onions caramelised here's a great tip for turning your hash browns over quick and easy take a plate place it on top and just flip it over and then slide it back in very quickly you see the color we've got on there now got that nice crispy texture of the potato i'm going to use the hash brown as a bed for my baked eggs crack in your eggs nice and gently just a little sprinkling of the cayenne to make the eggs a little bit spicy then into a preheated oven for six to eight minutes meanwhile onto my bacon and i'm giving it a classic american twist now one thing i could never get my head around when i first started eating lots of american breakfast was the sweetness from the bacon i've grown up to love that combination of smoky sweet flavors and it's so easy pan on and simply heat olive oil brown sugar salt and pepper and butter bacon in and as it cooks it becomes irresistibly caramelized and golden brown toaster gas and my glazed bacon absolutely ready beautiful now my hash browns and baked eggs are ready at that beautiful just put your spatula underneath there onto your plate and that bacon sets beauty on top of the baked eggs and that hash brown underneath and you can see why the best breakfasts in the world are always in america this is an all-american superhero offer breakfast eggs bait in hash browns with glazed bacon [Music]

If you liked this clip check out the...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, [Music] chilis are a fabulous ingredient and one of my absolute favorites is the chipotle chipotles begin life as a green jalapeno pepper the process of drying and smoking lends an intense smoky flavor to balance their spicy heat dried chipotles can be brought as a paste powder or whole which is how i'll be using them in my big bold lunch chilis come in all shapes and sizes and heats and are used throughout the world but if there's one cuisine that has really turned cooking them into an art form it's mexican they're experts at building layer upon layer flavoured with delicious chilies and spices so for my ultimate big and bold lunch spicy mexican soup it's hearty delicious robust but served with some tortillas and a wonderful salsa it's almost like a complete meal in one starting with some finely chopped red onions for my soup let's get some heat going early these are chipotle so they're smoky rich they don't come with any warning signal and these are seriously hot so be adventurous but beware a nice teaspoon of toasted cumin oregano dried now start frying off spices the heat you'll see the chilies start swelling up delicious garlic be quite generous on the oil because that helps to blow out the chili right now those onions and garlic are on fire we're going to balance the sort of heat from the chipotle with sugar turn up the heat and really start caramelizing that sugar and the chili gives off the most amazing aroma next fry up a tablespoon of tomato puree add a can of chopped tomatoes cooked kidney beans and vegetable or chicken stock to cover there's something quite exciting about big and bold flavors because in the restaurants you have to be somewhat controlled you can't go crazy so cooking these kind of dishes at home gives me that kind of release chilies particularly when they're dried continue to swell and release their heat as they're cooked so the longer you cook your dish the hotter it will be [Music] but it's not as powerful it needs to be yet and every five six seven eight minutes that's gonna get stronger hotter and more delicious bring that up to the ball and cook that out for 15 minutes whilst i allow the chilli heat to infuse i'm going to crack on with quick crunchy tortilla chips and a fabulously fresh and spicy tomato salsa known in mexico as pico de gallo start by finely dicing three ripe tomatoes one or two deceeded fresh jalapeno peppers and half a red onion then chop a good handful of fresh coriander add the juice from two limes salt and pepper and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil for the tortilla chips rub a little olive oil onto six large shop bought wheat wraps sprinkle with smoked paprika and gently massage in cut each wrap into triangles and spread them onto a baking tray bake for three to four minutes in a preheated oven 180 degrees until golden brown and leave to cool to complete my mexican lunch i need to finish my deliciously fragrant spicy soup the spice is there it is absolutely spot on now for the cooling down process the mexicans are brilliant at building layer upon layer of flavor with delicious chilies and spices but they're also experts at tempering their dishes with cooling ingredients like avocado sour cream and cheese that's why you can take that amount of chilli you've got a spoon of richness spice and all of a sudden avocados almost like a little fire blanket over those chilies to further counter the chilli heat mexicans use a rich tangy crumbly cheese but i'm sprinkling on lancashire which is a great british substitute and last but not least cooling fresh coriander one delicious spicy mexican soup serve that with your tortilla chips and your pico de gallo salsa a phenomenal blend of textures and layers and spice and creaminess big bold and delicious spicy mexican eggs this is a very classic mexican style brunch dish bold kick-ass flavors slice the chili seeds in garlic sliced nice and thinly a tablespoon of olive oil i'm a big fan of brunches and if you get it right a great brunch can see you right through to dinner now to start the sort of spicy fragrant tomato sauce get your cumin in there garlic chili roasted cumin red onions already sounds mexican once that starts getting really nice and crispy in with your tomatoes never embarrassed using good canned tomatoes i do all the time cooking at home now by reducing that you sort of come down to a delicious paste leave that to simmer next canned beans called black beans these are authentically mexican but cannellini beans or chickpeas will work just fine just rinse them a little bit of water that is beautiful turn off the gas and just let it absorb leaving the dense beans to luxuriate in the spicy tomato sauce will allow them to soften and soak up all the flavor next oil and season an oven-proof dish from my spicy egg brunch to baking i'll just get some of that oil round the outside take your corn tortillas slice them in half and then just stick them to the side these are a staple in mexico take one and place that in the center get your mix and place that on top of the tortilla spread that out nice and smoothly lift up those little flaps i want that crisp shell on the outside now your eggs and cheese get the base of the egg and just make a little hole in there and then crack the egg into there again use a little point put your egg in there one two three four five and one in the middle gently crack and get the egg to sit inside almost like it's a little dug out and then one for the center get a really nice rich delicious strong montgomery cheddar i want to grate the tortilla shell as well so get generous with it on the top i'm gonna season that with these little babies little chili flakes they're my little secret weapon and they're going to spice up that egg just salt a touch of pepper sip that in the oven to bake for eight to ten minutes and 180. [Music] [Applause] that smells incredible it's a little bit of coriander to finish it off and that for me is what brunch is all about let's go a fantastic fiery brunch to get your party started spicy mexican eggs and a crispy tortilla shell

fiery and irresistible spicy pancakes one of the secrets to good cooking is learning to use your imagination when it comes to brunches you don't have to stick to the old standbys these delicious spicy pancakes are really great alternative but more importantly so easy to do start off by toasting your cumin [Music] it's a dry roast basically non-stick pan just a touch of seasoning the salt helps to dry out the cumin even more and then fresh ginger slice them nice and thinly stack it back up and then just slice nice little thin slices in there and then keep that bunched up shake the chilli removing the seeds will prevent things getting too hot now garlic nice now add olive oil to your toasted cumin seeds and then with the garlic ginger and chili lovely and it feels strange when you talk about garlic for breakfast but the time i spent in india everybody was eating something savory for breakfast it was extraordinary into your bowl and set aside next the pancake filling add olive oil to a hot pan mustard seeds in now they'll start dancing the minute they hit the pan then finely slice an onion onions in a little teaspoon of turmeric sprinkle that in and look at the color an instant change leftover potatoes just slice them the smell is incredible potatoes in now spread the potatoes across the pan all the potatoes stained i want them sort of absorbing all that really nice turmeric actually like a sponge season those potatoes and it really helps to bring out the spice beautifully [Music] they're ready turn off the gas and let them sit there and absorb all those flavors back to the pancake batter add plain flour to your cooled garlic chili ginger and cumin seeds a touch of salt and pepper nothing worse than the bland pancake one whole egg milk hold the jug with one hand and whisk we have a secret to get that really nice smooth paste but whisking that egg first and brings it together and then you're milking don't put all the milk in because then you're gonna get a lumpy pancake mix and if you put less milk in it really helps it not going lumpy look at that milk here and the secret for me is to have a nice thin mix now just a little teaspoon of oil that helps to bring a nice crispy edge to the mixture now just taste it that's the texture pan on the larger the pan the better it helps to create a nice thin even surface i want that mix going all the way around the pan before you put the mixture into the pan make sure you give your pancake mix a really nice stir pan it's nice and hot turn down the gas a touch of olive oil in get that nice whisk with one hand pan to the mix in one and a half ladles and then roll it around which is really nice and thin i want to see the ginger the garlic that's what i'm looking for in there now back onto the heat it only starts to remove from the bottom of the pan and lifts itself up once it's cooked these little bubbles confirm that it's just starting to lift off the pan a little shake that releases it and then just shake it to the end and toss if you haven't got the confidence tossing then use a spatula and turn it over now that's exactly what i want that nice sort of crisp edge around the side the color on the pancake is so important now roll it around and just let it slide out beautifully now for the exciting part filling them take your potatoes just sort of have a really nice imaginary line and then just very carefully roll that nice and tightly tuck it underneath there pull it back and roll the delicious pancakes are ready to eat but with a simple dipping sauce there'll be a real treat just mix chopped coriander with natural yogurt that's really nice cooling agent sit there on the side and that for me is a great brunch delicious spicy pancakes amazing [Music] addition takes as much time to write on a blackboard as it does to cook chickpea cumin and spinach koftas with tahini dressing [Music] in a blender put tin chickpeas cumin seeds paprika and turmeric and blitz to a paste [Music] next wilt spinach in olive oil and chop finely then add to the chickpea mixture sprinkle in gram flour made from finely ground chickpeas then shape golf ball-sized chunks of the mixture using a spoon and rest in the fridge when ready to cook heat oil in a frying pan shallow fry the coppers until golden brown on all sides then rest them on kitchen paper to absorb any excess oil for an easy dipping sauce mix yogurt with a dollop of tahini and a squeeze of lemon and stir in freshly chopped coriander a mouth-watering dish that's perfect for sharing chickpea cumin and spinach coffees with tahini dressing time is chili chicken with ginger and coriander [Music] start by chopping chicken thighs into pieces now on with the marinade chop garlic ginger red chili and lemon juice [Music] in a pan toast coriander and cumin seeds to release their flavors grind and add to the chicken then pour over plain yogurt add turmeric and season mix and leave to marinate from 2 hours to overnight next fry chopped onions in olive oil then add chopped garlic and ginger ground coriander garam masala and turmeric tomato puree and butter next add the marinaded chicken and all the remaining marinade and cook until tender finally topped with coriander marinated for flavor and cooked in 20 minutes chili chicken with ginger and coriander a simple stress-free wonder to keep old dishes fresh and exciting it's great to get spicy my next recipe is a time-honored british classic but with addition of spices it's given a new lease of life fragrant spiced rice pudding i love cooking with spices but you don't have to just cook savory dishes using aromatics and spices across desserts takes your puddings to a completely different level first off our spices this is a fresh vanilla pod fragrant and packed full of flavor use the back of the knife and flatten it that removes all those little seeds off the skin of the vinegar pod take your knife slice down the middle and then when you open that up the smell is incredible take the tip of the knife and you scrape inside and look all those seeds dying to come out that is incredible there are thousands of seeds still ingrained to the pods so put them in to the casserole cardamom powerful spicy take two little pods place your knife on top and lightly crack them cracking the cardamom pods helps release all the amazing flavor cloves gives it that kind of aniseed flavour with a lot of depth one two three cinnamon stick snap and in just smelling that level of fragrance you can imagine what the rice pudding's gonna taste of turn on the heat lightly toast those spices just a couple of seconds and what's going to happen is just going to sort of enhance those spices in a way that it just draws out an even more powerful fragrance coconut milk in sugar two tablespoons milk and then a couple of tablespoons of cream bring it slowly to the boil to allow the flavours to infuse and this rice pudding reminds me of my time in india where i got really into that chai tea fragrance because it was just so delicious and so comforting take a lime in the lime just cuts through the richness of the coconut gives it that nice little bit of acidity goes fantastically well with the cinnamon and that fresh vanilla nice have a taste now let's go up to the boil give it a nice little clean around the outside and in with the rice use 200 grams of pudding rice don't wash it beforehand because the starch helps thicken the rice pudding in the oven and just turn that down to a light simmer and the pudding rice starts to open up and it absorbs all that coconut vanilla cardamom clove and cinnamon bring up to the bowl gently and cook it out three to five minutes boiling it rapidly the rice opens up and it goes into mush so we want to keep that nice texture that sort of fragrant rice pudding on a gentle simmer next a little luxury i want to show you how i take this simple delicious aromatic rice pudding to a completely different level here's what i do take two egg yolks separate them now give that a really nice whisk two nice tablespoons of mascarpone cheese whisk that into the egg yolks just to it's nice and smooth it's almost like finishing the rice pudding in a delicious custard turn off the gas add that into the rice pudding what happens it starts to enrich and really thicken this rice pudding and takes it to a completely different level the rice is still not cooked it's starting to go nice and soft you can just see how it's opening up but looks like rich aromatic lava bubbling away finally great more citrus zest the lime on top roasted caramelized lime zest on top of a rice pudding is phenomenal then put it in the oven for 15 minutes at 200 degrees to finish cooking the rice and develop the intensely aromatic flavors look at that an incredibly fragrant rice pudding how beautiful is that look spices are a brilliant way of helping classic dishes come alive i'll guarantee you'll never ever have had a rice pudding like this before you

disappear it'll be delicious trust me now good spring onions we'll chop up and that's going to go through the mashed potatoes it's going to sit on top of that nicer i like that savory yeah delicious mince that's laced with all that red wine nice so sprinkles into there please mum and i'm going to drain off the potatoes hi there hello hello oh hi jack hi hi hello hello jack have a nice day school yeah yeah so we'll dry out those potatoes and then mash them no oh can i mash them would you okay um holly slice a little knob of butter in there for jack please so what was the restaurant you worked out there were you a chef cook i love the diplomacy were you a chef i was a cookie exactly that not really you used to help me as little right you kids do no potatoes these are nice and fluffy are they aren't they and do you want mom look delicious mashed potatoes yeah with no lumps in there hey weren't you getting it huh it's great having you back in the kitchen mommy now yeah seriously brings back good memories no just why'd you do that dad i just wanted to fork it to get it nice and spiky so i want that nice crispy topping and then lightly grate that cheddar cheese on top and that goes in the oven literally 20 minutes 180 minutes jack can you on the door please that looks lovely doesn't it even though you said you didn't like it earlier okay back in the day mama's meals all came with two veg and this is no different but with a modern twist braised peas and carrots with a fantastic homemade mint butter shepherd's pie glazed on top that looks lovely doesn't it and then the carrots that's why i didn't put carrots in let's put them on the side i'll see last job before serving pour that gorgeous butterscotch sauce over the pudding okay i'll take one at a time that smells incredible this is my ultimate childhood dinner shepherd's pie with crispy cheese champ topping sweet buttery peas and carrots that is the rib eye we've had that in the fridge not wrapped so it sort of almost air dries and it intensifies the flavor gross so much quicker and there's less water in the beef for me the only downside to perfect roast dinner is the fight about who washes up afterwards so meg and i are going to avoid that by cooking everything in one roasting tin starting with the spinach and mushroom stuffing [Music] a little bit of salt and pepper please here we go some of your left shoulder left shoulder thank you in with the garlic and the mushrooms to toss the pan you push down and pull back down and push back off you go take your time push it down and flip back good that's it push down nice that was lovely and again nice oh i'm gonna drop let's see well done well done well then right we're gonna sort of make a little well a little touch of butter in the middle now we need to start putting the spinach in the middle please so you can push that down spinach is cold so you're not gonna burn yourself be confident in the pan toss it and you'll see it wilting and disintegrating away wow who would have thought all that spinach could fit in this pan because it's a very delicate leaf it sort of cooks so quickly put this all on your board now and then i just want you to go and give that a nice chop then when you're confident with one hand we need to pick up the other knife the other hand chop it nicely good now outside and come in gently good regroup and take your time good mmm right i love that smell what is that lemon thyme lemon tan that's right so you get your little thyme stalks and you pour down you sort of strip lemon thyme in now tarragon taste brilliant with the beef fantastic with chicken and fish roughly chop the tarragon when i sprinkle the fresh breadcrumbs so the breadcrumbs almost sort of bring the stuffing together next we're gonna get an egg yolk now with the beef this is the exciting part slice with the bone and then come inside and go two thirds of the way down hold that open for daddy salt and pepper and then look we pack our stuffing in there this is amazing it's incredible now just gently hold that there like that okay yeah i'll see you tomorrow what tying string around the rib will keep it all together during roasting not too tight if we tie it too tightly what happens the stuffing will come out that's right that's ready for roasting but we're gonna protect it and sit it on a trivet so trivet basically is almost like a sort of little little bed a little bed that's right if you want to enjoy these delicious roast vegetables at their best make sure you remove them from the hot oven after 35 minutes and reheat before serving with your beef a little mix for the top a couple of teaspoons of mustard powder in salt a couple of tablespoons of olive oil mix that in i'm gonna pour my mustard powder over the beef so this forms a really nice glaze my one pot roast dinner goes into a hot oven 15 minutes at 230 degrees then down to 170 degrees for another two hours for a delicious twist on traditional yorkshire puds i'm going to lace mine with fresh horseradish [Music] start with plain white flour in a bowl and crack in the eggs adding only half of your milk at this stage makes it much easier to whisk all the lumps out and if like me you like your puddings a little lighter and crispier add a dribble of cold water and add salt to season when you're happy your batter is lump free whisk in the remaining milk peel and grate horseradish and add a handful to the mix we can leave the batter to rest while we get the meat from the oven that is beautiful and this is where you really need to let it rest how long would you say to rest it for um i like to rest the meat for at least 20 minutes just the right amount of time for us to whack up the oven and to get our yorkshire puddings in i love using the rich dripping but vegetable all is a healthier option to get the fluffiest yorkshires your tray and fat must be piping hot for best results take your jug of batter to the oven and pour the mixture in there it takes just 15 minutes for our yorkshire puds to puff themselves up and turn a delicious golden brown that up place that onto the board parsnips parrots you can see why we kept them in half they've got all that flavor one beautiful big slice for daddy one for maggie and then from the side the stuffing the stuffing the bit that's the best to die for now fantastic yorkshire they're amazing aren't they beautiful mm-hmm that's for you my daddy on that one that's for me beautiful roast beef with a twist wow [Music] i go fishing a lot and scotch eggs are the perfect all-in-one mini picnic breakfast first thing get your eggs cooked bring the water up the boil onto the spoon and lower them into the water that way they don't hit the water and crack four and a half minutes that'll keep the center nice and slightly runny now ground sausage meat i'm gonna make mine a little bit spicier i'm gonna crumble in black pudding that helps to season the scotch eggs inside a little touch of salt and pepper and then just to make it a little bit sweeter and a lot easier for the kids to eat some grated apple [Music] combine that blend in the apple and the black pudding eggs once they're cooked drain them and then run them under cold water cracking and cooling the eggs quickly will prevent the yolks turning gray tap them on the side of the pan put them back into the water and what happens the water seeps underneath the shell see the shelf come off so much easier eggs still slightly soft in the center i want that little bit of richness with the yolk next you need to get yourself organized with a mini assembly line seasoned flour a little egg wash and breadcrumbs take your mince golf ball size spread the pate manipulate with your thumb and then sit your egg in there and spread the sausage over the egg and you just seal that over it's really important to keep that nice even coating of sausage meat around the egg you don't want it too thick otherwise it gets too dense and it's unappetizing give them a light dusting in the seasoned flour if you don't put the flour on the egg wash won't stick and if you don't put the egg wash on the breadcrumbs won't stick into the egg roll it round shake off any excess egg wash and roll it into your breadcrumbs you can use this same three-stage method to breadcrumb anything you like from chicken guzons and fish fillets to fina schnitzel these are panko breadcrumbs japanese white breadcrumb so no crust you can experiment by adding flavours to your breadcrumbs like parmesan herbs or citrus zest i always like to push the actual breadcrumbs into the sausage meat so it gets that really nice golden brown and stops any of the outside burning once breadcrumbed lower the eggs carefully into a four centimetre deep bath of hot vegetable oil for 10 to 12 minutes the eggs are actually cooked soft and running the center so the objective is just to cook the sausage meat and the black pudding looks great don't they go and grenades there's something so magical about a scotch egg on a picnic because it's like this little mini breakfast beautiful drain them onto the paper roll them round just to get off any excess oil and then to transport them some greaseproof paper that for me is the perfect start to the fishing trip it's no wonder i never catch any fish because i'm always too busy eating my scotch eggs [Music] my ultimate black pudding lace scotch eggs an irresistibly delicious picnic breakfast you

onions good girl now look at the color of the onions right now time for a little drink for the brisket okay one bottle of beer in please so you go in you put yours in there i'll put mine here good uh good health to you and your brisket good health bring that to the ball okay now this is where it gets really exciting i want you to lift the brisket up and put it on top of the onions in she goes good girl and then i want you to pour the stock all the way around please i'm using beef stock but it will work with chicken stock or even vegetable stock once the stock has come to the boil cover tightly with foil and just pinch in the ends flatten that down and then you just twist all the way so that's nice and tight that's the hard work done thank you simply pop it in the oven for three and a half hours and as it cooks you can get on with the side dishes first job sweet potato wedges with some serious flavor start by making a spice mix in a dry pan toast coriander seeds until beautifully aromatic then put them in a pestle and mortar add salt and grind [Music] next smoked paprika dried oregano cayenne pepper and mix spice mix done now simply cut your sweet potatoes into wedges toss in olive oil and thoroughly cover with the spice mix onto a baking tray and into a preheated oven for 30 minutes turning halfway irresistible sweet potato wedgies are ready now to finish off my beef see that smell just sort of travels everywhere oh ah now look at that so we can leave that to rest what does resting mean resting means where you've cooked a joint and you just leave it to relax so it'll make the meat so much more tender okay right coleslaw traditionally you would mix slaw with what mayonnaise that's right mayonnaise this time we're gonna do it a little different so i'd like to put the yogurt into the bowl for me please all of it i'll start slicing the white cabbage and the red cabbage now from there a nice tablespoon of mustard in there please give that a nice mix up nice little touch of salt and pepper okay now a little cider vinegar so a little splash of cider vinegar in there okay as i shred this okay i'd like you please then to get the red cabbage and just open up

look at that and here's the thing about helping daddy cook here's the perk you get to taste it first before anybody that is so good that tastes delicious see all that wonderful flavor in there last job is to create an incredibly quick and delicious sauce gas on and reduce the spicy juices and onions the beef cooked in then add in cider vinegar and you've got a brilliant tangy barbecue sauce that

flower going to do dad the flower helps to brown the beef our seasoned flour will also help to add flavor and thicken the stew i feel a bit like marshmallows they do feel a little bit marshmallow don't they look at the size of the chunks of the beef i'm going to cut my carrots literally be similar similar size that's right does that mean they'll cook equally that's right now these are little pearl onions i'm going to put them in hole as well everything has to stay the same otherwise it could burn oh we've seen burned garlic before oh matilda she promised you weren't going to mention that what is that time time and what are they bay leaves bailey's good girl tablespoon of oil in the beef goes in first okay in a really nice color got a beautiful color remember the carrots thyme in good girl garlic pearl onions in good give that a really good mix up [Music] daddy stews are very easy to make providing at the beginning to give it a little bit of love now that's all beautifully browned that bin that is beer and that's going to deglaze the pan adding beer or stout helps to tenderize the beef and give it a hearty delicious flavor and that's the only way i want you to taste beer in a stew yeah i'm going to add in a couple of teaspoons of tomato puree please in fact three please because it's so nice there's one final thing in there cover the steering state with the bee stock give

you can focus on your homework fun time to knock up two delicious hearty potato classics in one twice baked bubbling squid jacket potatoes start by baking large potatoes in a preheated oven at 180 degrees shred one third of your savoy cabbage and saute in butter and add a dash of water until tender [Music] after about half an hour your potatoes should be crisp on the outside and cook through in the middle slice them in half and scoop out the soft potato center then mash with a couple of knobs of butter mix in the cabbage and season to taste spoon this mixture back into your potato shells and into the oven for a further 10 minutes or until the tops are nice and crispy and golden two delicious hearty potato classics in one twice baked bubbling squeak jacket potatoes [Music] right homework

you stem ginger and fresh ginger next add your stem ginger a little of the stem ginger syrup good girl and some brown sugar to your quartered pears and then just grab some fresh ginger off you go so it's a bit of a different one to grate this because it doesn't really come through like the cheese no i'm gonna make that a little bit zesty now we've got some lemons some lemon zest in there right what we need to do now is give that a nice little mix now this is a sweet pastry you can buy this stuff where you make it it's so easy to do so give me your finger that's my center point i want you to

flour then add coconut for texture and a pinch of salt sounds strange in the dessert but it works brilliantly especially with the fritters makes the batter nice and crisp start crushing and use the back of the fork and just push it against the side of the bowl and then once you've mixed that through i'm gonna make that mix now slightly fragrant with some lime zest now the lime just really elevates the sort of richness and the denseness of the banana a couple of tim film so it doesn't get a skin on top sit that in the fridge for 15 minutes batter now is ready use a metal spoon to drop the batter to the bottom of the pan i mean they hit that oil they puff up that's why it's important to put your spoon into the oil so the mixture runs off and creates this lovely little fritter and then gently fry get a slotted spoon and nice and carefully turn them over the smell of that lime is extraordinary fry for two to three minutes as they start floating it signifies the fact that they're cooked off with a gas and just let them drain are those beauties lovely sprinkling when they're hot with the sugar actually sticks to them they're done ready to go gazpacho for dessert sweet and refreshing pineapple like you've never tasted before first job the gazpacho soup for me the secret of a great gazpacho is overripe tomatoes peppers cucumber a little bit of heat with a garlic we've got to leave it to marinade first peppers cut around the flat edges to minimize waste [Music] then chop the nice thing about making the gazpacho there's no set recipe because you can put it together purely all tomatoes half peppers half tomatoes i like the flavor of the cucumber in there as well that gives it that freshness the secret of a great gazpacho is the longer you leave it marinating the better the flavour so if you can get this done the night before and left in the fridge the results are stunning the green and red peppers have subtly complementary flavors and go well with ripe tomatoes start off by removing the bitter core get a little knife and just put it in where the core is and twist it around and you get this little core out i remember my first experience eating a gazpacho in spain mind-blowing i've never forgotten that quarter your tomatoes keeping the juicy seeds that add so much depth of taste nice then from there cucumber just peel that the seeds i'm gonna leave in that gives it the flavor and the texture cucumber and gazpacho does exactly what it does in a pims it sort of freshens it up and makes it mouth-watering slice that in half again into quarters and chop now to give gazpacho its unique texture and thicken the soup bread and the crispy the crust the better then garlic thinly sliced next spring onions nice and roughly chopped and basil stalks and all we can use stalks and basil stalks parsley stalks tarragon stalks they have the most amazing flavor basil in and now we're gonna start marinating salt black pepper and a good coating of olive oil this gives it a glossy creamy flavor and the cherry vinegar that's the perfect vinegar for the gazpacho it's a strong acidic complement to the flavors then just mix it up and the smell already is incredible it doesn't look like a gazpacho but by the time this marinades and all those flavors start getting to know one another all of a sudden you've got this huge explosion of contrast now push that down in the restaurants we press the marinade down overnight a couple of big pans on top and we crush all the ingredients and then blitz it the next day flavor is extraordinary leave all those fresh ingredients packed with goodness to marinade from half an hour to even overnight and then when you blend it it just comes together like this sumptuous rich delicious chilled soup to go with my super tasty soup i've got an ultra healthy and exciting dessert carpaccio of pineapple which is a chefy way of saying super thinly sliced it's done with a twist we're gonna have a delicious flavoured salt has to be flavored with vanilla simply scrape out the vinegar seeds and add to sea salt along with the pod to store now that basically keeps forever there's no sale by date because it's salt and vanilla so so fragrant so delicious you don't need much of this fragrant salt to intensify the sweetness of the pineapple pineapple sliced peeled pineapple into wafer thin pieces it's almost like nice little discs slightly transparent [Music] once you've sliced the pineapple take the flavor to another level a light sprinkle of vanilla salt and arrange the pineapple in a flower shape [Music] it's a beautiful way of finishing a meal the fragrance other than the crunch with the salt and the vanilla salt just marinades the pineapple beautifully then scatter nutrient rich pomegranate seeds over the top to finish finely shredded fresh mint just slice them really thin and then give that nice cool minty flavour pineapple my carpaccio is ready and my gazpacho has been marinating in the fridge time to blend the soup in onto your blender and start off nice and slowly blend until super fine and gloriously silky and serve refreshingly cold get your bowl and pour it in now to finish it get some fresh basil roll it nice and tight and shred it and then drop it into your bowl fresh chopped basil and then finally just a touch of extra virgin olive oil just to give that really nice additional freshness and look at that healthy and delicious gazpacho soup to me is a taste of mediterranean sunshine in a bowl followed by the wafer thin carpaccio of pineapple with jewels of pomegranate goodness for dessert practically all of your five a day in one incredible healthy lunch you

#GordonRamsay #Cooking...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.926159, you think of the flavor and the texture of avocado rich phenomenal i want to make it a little bit more vibrant black sesame seeds a nice pinch of chili flakes i quite like it hot a touch of salt and a touch of pepper so that nice dry combination of the lemon zest black sesame seeds and the heat the chili this is light healthy quick but so tasty sourdough bread three nice chunky thick slices open them up lightly season them little touch of olive oil brings the whole crust to life rub all that seasoning in but you can use too bad you can use a baguette but the richness from the sourdough with the silky creaminess of avocado is mind-blowing and then get the grill up to temperature and push these down go the extra mile we've all put bread in a toaster of a difference of grilling the bread this way is extraordinary that nice smoky charcoal flavor off with the gas beautiful now the avocado you've got to treat them with love respect press on the end here and if your thumb softens you can tell that avocado's ripe never press here you just end up bruising it slice down until you feel that stone in the middle and then just roll around and then it's just a little gentle twist off stone and out cut them into quarters the back of your knife peel back that skin if the avocado is nice and ripe it should just all fall away slice just take your quarters fan them out and push them into the bread the ripe of the avocado the better the flavor but look for ones free from soft spots and blemishes which can suggest bruising get your lemon squeeze that will stop the avocado from discoloring and then get your crunch ready to go on top sprinkle a very generous light way got the fragrance from the lemon zest the crunch from the sesame seed the heat that little chili flake which just wakes up that avocado they look expensive that for me is a delicious light start to the day avocado on sourdough toast with lemon and black sesame sprinkle every time i put a healthy recipe together a healthy dish it needs a bit of a treat so this is a lovely stunning get up and go fresh granola first thing in the morning the treat here is in that little baby honey so that sweetens it so just start off with 200ml of delicious honey into a pan just to warm up in she goes now i know these are a chef's favorite but it makes all the difference especially for breakfast a fresh vanilla pod and i think of the way that i use herbs to add flavor to soups and salads i'd like to think vanilla does exactly the same scrape out all those wonderful seeds in now the staple of the granola is the oats [Music] next puff rice delicious crunchy but light and fluffy next add wheat bran and your seeds pumpkin sunflower and linseed and then almonds incredible that nice heavy weight from the nut bunch now bring the honey to the boil slowly drizzle that amazing honey in give that a really good mix coat the granola with the hot honey just slowly churn it using the outside of the bowl you can see it just getting nice and sticky once the granola is completely coated in honey it's ready to bake now spread the mix on baking paper i'm gonna season it lightly with a touch of salt on top the salt throughout dries up the oats and the honey will roast color and glaze the granola nice into the oven for 25 to 30 minutes [Music] 10 minutes into the cooking simply run a spoon across the top to turn the mix and ensure it's crunchy all over smell that light roast look at the color honestly look it's crispy it's delicious now i'm gonna tart it up and put some lovely dried cranberries that just gives us chewy sweet flavor delicious and then finally these beautiful berries goji berries goji berries are high in antioxidants and have been eaten china for centuries for their healing properties but you can add any dried fruit you like the cranberry and the goji berries gives it that nice chewy rich texture to the granola now this is the best way to store it it looks incredible really incredible look at that that eat well stay well right milk my homemade crunchy granola it looks good tastes good and it's packed with healthy grains superfood berries and seeds it's incredibly good for you too a breakfast for champions start off with a chili now give it a little rub so you can hear those seeds being released get your knife and come all the way down turn it over and just slice it into four and then finely chop that chili i want this salad slightly hot so i'm gonna use all the chili but a half the seeds the seeds are where the heat is so the less you use the milder your dish nicely chopped next one of my favorite pastes tamarind paste this is quite tart quite sour but it's a wonderful compliment to the sweetness of the fruit and it goes brilliantly well with the chilli palm sugar and this is where it sweetens up the dressing because it enriches it then the zest and the juice of the lime cut it into quarters and then twist the lime to maximize and all that juice out now to finish that dressing off some toasted peanuts get the pan nice and hot a little touch of salt that'll help dry roast the peanuts even quicker make sure you get a really nice dark color on those peanuts because it will really transform that dressing to crush your roasted nuts the mess free way simply wrap them in a clean cloth and use a rolling pin or a pan to bash them crush that's the hard bit done now for the fruit and here's an easy way to prep a pineapple pineapple take off the top take off the bottom and stand it up use the corner of your knife and follow down basically like shaving the pineapple don't worry about these little spikes there the secret behind doing it this way is not losing half the pineapple there's nothing wrong with a few brown bits it's all good fiber slice the pineapple in half and then slice down each quarter slice across and chop delicious pineapple chunks next apples and pears diced then to give a lovely fresh light note the seeded cucumber i don't want the seeds in the fruit salad the cucumber seeds will make it very watery and dilute the strength of that wonderful chili in there cucumber in with some sweetness delicious mango just slice it nicely get your dressing and just drizzle that over the fruit salad in secret of a good fruit salad is not drowning in the dressing but really make sure that you've got that nice coating on all the fruits don't worry about just having for breakfast because this is the kind of tangy fruit salad you can have for lunch a healthy snack in the afternoon but it transforms a traditional fruit salad into something really delicious spicy fruit salad with a kick of chili trust me it's an incredible breakfast and a guaranteed pick me up in the morning

If you...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.927159, my first recipe is so quick and easy but seriously impressive and deceptively cheap homemade gnocchi making your enoki is so simple to do yet the results are absolutely stunning and it's a great way of using up leftover baked potatoes you can make noki just with flour and eggs however the potato gives it a nice light sort of creamy fluffy texture cut them in half take your spoon and scoop the inside of those potatoes i'm using leftover baked potatoes but this really works as well with leftover ball potatoes two choices you can get a fork and sort of mash the potato and get it nice and light and fluffy or this little gadget it's called a ricer i suppose it's a posh word for a potato masher just squeeze gently you can see how nice and light it is almost like fluffy little strands of potato you can do this when the potatoes are hot it'll go through the rice just so much quicker just slice that off there now a nice spoon of okata a little touch of salt and pepper it's really important to season the mixture as we go along otherwise the nokia becomes really bland flour over the ricotta sieve so there's no lumps one delicious egg give that a little whisk now make a little well in the center you want a nice soft pliable ball of dough give that a really good mix get some time flowers in there and this time is light fragrant and it's just a really nice herb and with the ricotta it tastes brilliant just pick the little tips the time flowers next flour your hands generously and knead the mixture into a dough fold in and push and basically what it's doing is get it nice and smooth as it starts to get a little bit wet and just add a little touch of flour we want something really nice and soft now don't overwork it it stops the nokia from expanding when it hits the pan that's exactly what i want a nice sort of soft fragrant ball cut the ball in half lightly flour the hands and just roll it gently just think of a big long cigar the mixture will start getting a little bit sort of wetter but do not add lots of flour now lightly flour the knife so when you slice the gnocchi it doesn't stick cut the dough into bite-sized pieces just take your finger dip it in the flour and push down why i want my nokia to look like a pillow and for me the most important part there is that not one of them are identically the same shape water on bring up to the boil little touch of olive oil in there lightly flour your hand lift up the gnocchi in to the rolling boiling water turn that pan to stop them from sticking at the bottom and let them simmer and they start to sort of tell you they're cooked when they start floating get a pan on get that nice and hot now they're just starting to come up to the top and you can continue cooking them like that i like blanching them in the water taking them out and then frying them to study the gnocchi heat olive oil in a frying pan gently lift up and look they've doubled in size drain it get rid of the excess water and straight in to the hot pan [Music] this is where they start to take on a completely different texture nice crisp sauteed texture on the outside nokia loves fresh pepper so pepper in you can see as i start turning them you've got this really nice little sort of brown color and they're almost popping up now like little parcels so i want them nice and sauteed both sides but light and creamy in the center fresh garden peas in and the butter gives it that really nice sort of bernoullisette flavour on the end beautiful a little bit of fresh thyme over the peas and then finally i want to lift it up fresh lemon zest the lemon over [Music] smells incredible and then finally seal the deal with a touch of grated parmesan cheese give your vegetable attitude and you'll get amazingly elegant dishes on a budget that are always guaranteed to impress what more do you want from great cooking keep to make easy to cook and absolutely stunning i absolutely love bacon bread there's something really satisfying about doing it and this focaccia recipe is very hands-on but the end result is something really really tasty first off start with the dough tip 500 grams of strong bread flour into a mixing bowl and add 20 grams of semolina that gives the focaccia its sort of rustic charm now there's one thing for catcher needs it's really good seasoning you can't season bread after it's baked so it's got to go in right at the very beginning sprinkling 15 grams of dried yeast take some warm water and then 50 ml of olive oil top of that water that gives it this really nice silky rich texture make a little well mix up that yeast water and oil in start off with your fingers keep your fingers nice and open it's like a little sort of whisk going in there i'm looking for a really nice sort of relaxed dough now that's just starting to come together touch more water with oil in there give it a little swirl and then again the secret is to sort of knead it gently don't overwork it it's a sort of easy bread to make a nice one to start off with when you're making bread for the first time basically kneading means just knit it together just hanging lightly flour your board and let's just knead that focaccia into a nice smooth dough make sure you don't over add too much flour otherwise it sort of dries out the dough something quite magical about making bread you can switch off and lose yourself my first job for a three mission style establishment was a baker i was 22 years of age i used to start at midnight i was under such a tight schedule one o'clock white bread done two o'clock brown bread three o'clock sourdough four o'clock cheese bread five o'clock prove bake six o'clock crack them open and taste it was amazing beautiful yeah looks stunning it hasn't even risen yet leave your dough to rise in a warm place until it's doubled in size we call this proving [Music] look at that beautiful a lot of chefs sort of need it for the second time but i'm looking for a really nice light aerated for catcher take a tray a touch of olive oil in there season it at the bottom really important that's the exciting thing about focaccio you've got that really nice sort of salty top and salty bottom and just with a touch of olive oil on your hands gently push that in and almost massage it into the corners it's possible to put sort of olives and tomatoes and garlic through the dough but it never really allows the dough to sort of bake properly when you put so much ingredients in i'm going to stick mine on top use your finger and sort of just push them in salt on top some pepper on top as well i want some nice fresh amazing rosemary just hold the stalk and just pull off and then just sprinkle down generous on the rosemary really important to have that nice fragrance on top of the fuckacha finish it off before it goes in with a little drizzle of olive oil so it almost sinks in those little pockets of flavor olive tomato rosemary and olive oil into the oven [Music] bake your focaccia at 200 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes smells delicious [Music] beautiful [Music] you can hear how crispy that is you can't beat a nice warm fresh slice of home-cooked focaccia it's rustic charming and it's the perfect way to start baking making homemade for catcher is so addictive [Music] my next amazingly aromatic recipe is roasted squash hummus [Music] start with my take on razal hanut a classic moroccan spice blend in a dry pan toast cinnamon cloves coriander fenugreek and fennel seeds then add mustard seeds and cumin when the seeds start to pop they're ready add paprika and grind into a fine powder for the hummus peel and chop butternut squash put on a baking tray and add garlic simply bashed and chopped ginger drizzle with olive oil season and sprinkle over the spice mix then roast in a hot oven for half an hour until soft allow to cool and place in a blender add tahini a nutty paste made from sesame seeds cooked chickpeas a dash of lemon juice and a drizzle of olive oil blitz until luxuriously creamy and textured spices toasted for maximum flavor amazing roasted squash hummus my next recipe takes the humble pancake to a whole new level of flavor and excitement soft fiery and irresistible spicy pancakes one of the secrets to good cooking is learning to use your imagination when it comes to brunches you don't have to stick to the old standbys these delicious spicy pancakes a really great alternative but more importantly so easy to do start off by toasting your cumin [Music] it's a dry roast basically non-stick pan just a touch of seasoning the salt helps to dry out the cumin even more and then fresh ginger slice them nice and thinly stack it back up and then just slice nice little thin slices in there and then keep that bunched up shake the chilli removing the seeds will prevent things getting too hot now garlic nice now add olive oil to your toasted cumin seeds and then with the garlic ginger and chili lovely [Music] and it feels strange when you talk about garlic for breakfast but the time i spent in india everybody was eating something savory for breakfast it was extraordinary into your bowl and set aside next the pancake filling add olive oil to a hot pan mustard seeds in now they'll start dancing the minute they hit the pan then finely slice an onion onions in a little teaspoon of turmeric sprinkle that in and look at the color an instant change leftover potatoes just slice them the smell is incredible potatoes in now spread the potatoes across the pan while the potatoes stained i want them sort of absorbing all that really nice turmeric actually like a sponge season those potatoes it really helps to bring out the spice beautifully they're ready turn off the gas and let them sit there and absorb all those flavors back to the pancake batter add plain flour to your cooled garlic chili ginger and cumin seeds touch with salt and pepper nothing worse than the bland pancake one whole egg milk hold the jug with one hand and whisk we have a secret to get that really nice smooth paste but whisk in that egg first and brings it together and then you're milking don't put all the milk in because then you're going to get a lumpy pancake mix and if you put less milk in it really helps it not going lumpy look at that milk here the secret for me is to have a nice thin mix now just a little teaspoon of oil that helps to bring a nice crispy edge to the mixture now just taste that's the texture pan on the larger the pan the better it helps to create a nice thin even surface i want that mix going all the way around the pan before you put the mixture into the pan make sure you give your pancake mix a really nice stir pan it's nice and hot turn down the gas a touch of olive oil get that nice whisk with one hand pan to the mix in one and a half ladles and then roll it around so it's really nice and thin i want to see the ginger the garlic that's what i'm looking for in there now back onto the heat it only starts to remove from the bottom of the pan and lifts itself up once it's cooked these little bubbles confirm that it's just starting to lift off the pan a little shake that releases it and then just shake it to the end and toss if you haven't got the confidence tossing then use a spatula and turn it over now that's exactly what i want that nice sort of crisp edge around the side the color on the pancake is so important now roll it round and just let it slide out beautifully now for the exciting part filling them take your potatoes just sort of have a really nice imaginary line and then just very carefully roll that nice and tightly tuck it underneath there pull it back and roll useful the delicious pancakes are ready to eat but with a simple dipping sauce there'll be a real treat just mix chopped coriander with natural yogurt that's really nice cooling agent sit there on the side and that for me is a great brunch delicious spicy pancakes amazing

you know where everything is stock spatula pan etc it becomes less stressful but more importantly the end results are incredible [Music] first off get your pan on whisk and stock start off with this amazing fermented soy bean puree into the pan three nice tablespoons gas on now get your fish stock and whisk into the puree be generous with the stock you want this nice light broth basically you can buy miso paste from big supermarkets and it works brilliantly with salmon poaching the salmon in the miso stuff gives it a really nice sort of sweet earthy creamy flavor it's incredible bring it to the i'm going to infuse the broth and make it a little bit more fragrant kaffir lime leaf is very lemony inside the miso broth then chopped chili chili's in and finely sliced ginger that's simmering beautifully now we're gonna poach the salmon poaching means cooking it in liquid but it's cooked gently and the secret here is to keep that salmon skin on if we take the skin off now the salmon can actually break up whilst it's poaching skin side down i'm just going to slide that in under nice the minute that stock starts boiling turn it down let it simmer take a little ladle and just every couple of minutes pour over that makes sure the top of the salmon is cooked evenly and keeps it nice and moist and poaching is one of the most delicate ways of cooking so you have to handle it with care whilst the salmon's poaching in the miso broth start preparing your vegetables i'm using tender stem broccoli and bak choy i always like to cook the leaf and the stem separately the leaf is like sort of spinach and the stem is so much thicker it's almost as thick as a stick of celery so i like to get the stems sliced just so i've got that nice sort of place the leaves together nicely roll them up nice and tight and then slice them down now my salad already the flavor in that broth has been elevated now it tastes really fishy got the heat the chili spiciness the ginger and the caffeine lime leaf take your fish slice and place it very gently underneath the salmon and push it down fish slices are flexible for that reason bend it lift it up just touch looking for a springy firm texture and just sit there on top a little touch of the broth over it it stops it from drying out leave that to cool down for two minutes bring the stock back up to the boil broccoli and bak choy stems in a little taste it's getting better and better and better cook the broccoli and the bok choy stems for one minute and then add the tops in turn the salmon into your hand and just peel all that skin off the skin also helps to keep the salmon nice and moist then gently flake the salmon that's the secret behind poaching everything just stays so moist wonderful long shards of pink now just before we serve we're going to add our mushrooms these are enoki mushrooms you can buy these in oaky mushrooms in big supermarkets and good grocers slice them off i'm going to put half in and the other half i'm gonna serve with the salmon toasted sesame seed oil put a little drip in there just rub and you're just lining almost like a little coat of varnish start off with your mushrooms and then my salmon

mama's meals all came with two veg and this is no different but with a modern twist braised peas and carrots with a fantastic homemade mint butter shepherd's pie glazed on top that looks lovely doesn't it and then the carrots that's why i didn't put carrots in let's put them on the side i'll see last job before serving pour that gorgeous butterscotch sauce over the pudding okay i'll take one at a time that smells incredible this is my ultimate childhood dinner shepherd's pie with crispy cheese champ topping sweet buttery peas and carrots [Music] that is the most amazing pork butt butts away butts away now this is incredible there's the shoulder yeah and look there's the shoulder blade if you go through here there's a knuckle there that's connecting the top and that's why it's called a butt the slower you cook it the more juicy it is and it's great for big parties because you just come along and get your fork and shred it a delicious smoky mayonnaise and you're away onions into half and half again okay i'm gonna leave the roots on okay because i want this to sit underneath the pore it gives it a chance to cook evenly and doesn't get dry in the bottom really important okay now i'll peel the garlic okay i'd like you and to crush the garlic we're gonna make a really nice little paste okay go on maggie come on come on come on nice good girl one more crush come on miggy now this is a beauty paprika smoked paprika i love it so three nice tablespoons in okay two large tablespoons of brown sugar salt please and pepper could go [Laughter] so gonna form a nice paste now olive oil in mix that some thyme in there so we've got a sort of fragrant rub time stalks underneath so that's even more flavor going on on the bottom pour that all over it now this is where you've got to be really quick okay and sort of rub that mashed sausage in almost exactly that smells amazing honestly you just drizzle a little touch of olive on top of that for me i keep the pork nice and moist lovely like some of the best party dishes the marinading of the pork shoulder can be done days in advance so if i was doing this for a sunday and start marinating thursday friday so it gets even tastier right quite easy as well to make it's very easy five and a half to six hours in the oven at 140. while our pork butt slowly roasts meg and i are going to pimp some shot-bought mayonnaise i don't like just plain mayonnaise there's so many things you have to twist to us yeah there's so many things something exciting you can do with it right salt pepper and little touch of honey sweetness yeah sweetness but there's some heat coming okay and i've got a little bit off you love this chipotle smoked chipotle paste i love that once you've made this dressing you know it can sit in the fridge great for open sandwiches yeah you can use it for any sandwiches really any sandwiches but goes brilliantly well with pork now just have a little taste i've never had this before it's so good a nice spoon of mustard so that's our nice spicy mayonnaise after five and a half hours in the oven our pork is nearly ready just time to knock up a couple of tried and tested party favorites first deliciously simple cheesy crushed potatoes cut potatoes into even chunks and submerge in salted boiling water skins and all meanwhile finely dice sweet pickled gherkins or cornichons trim and finely chop spring onions and grate some nutty gruyere cheese when the potatoes are cooked through drain roughly crush and add your spring onions and gherkins [Music] season to taste and gently combined before a final sprinkling of grated greer these simple cheesy crushed potatoes are equally delicious served hot or cold now i want something sort of raw like a slaw something quite refreshing yeah so i'm gonna make a really nice fresh broccoli salad now these are called florets and that's the best part of the broccoli okay the bit that everybody wants once they're off i'm going to slice the broccoli okay mm-hmm never had raw broccoli before it's always been cooked really when you dress this with the dressing it's incredible now a little season early on yeah okay now for the dressing fresh yogurt in a teaspoon of sugar please daddy a little smell cider vinegar mmm there you go finely chop shallot in with the broccoli so delicious roasted almonds into the broccoli currants i love them that gives that nice sort of chewy texture all right lift up your bowl please nice and gently half of that in the middle please thank you and stop and then mix that up with me a little taste so good and this kind of salad it doesn't wilt a couple of hours later it's still crunchy because the broccoli is raw raw broccoli salad chipotle now let me be the poor cow for this look at this megan honestly that is amazing it's beautiful that is incredible [Music] now that goes to the table like that i thought let's have a tiny bit just before we go to the table just a little bit honestly meg don't tell mom thank you honestly do i do it i'm gonna do it that is incredible so good you promise me you don't give the recipe to your boyfriend let's go come on this is my ultimate easy party dinner melt in your mouth slow cook smokey pulled pork with a spicy chipotle mayonnaise first job i have pomegranate marinade for the quail which have been cut in half and flattened so small aren't they small yeah it's tiny so it's almost like a sort of nice entrance into eating something slightly gamey okay if you give them a nice season for me salt and pepper and all spatchcock means is the rib cage has been taken out and they're flattened down and because the bird is so delicate it's flattened to cook evenly and it really is a nice sort of light gamey dense chicken flavor so we're toaster spices when you think of middle eastern food it's packed with amazing flavors tablespoon of coriander a teaspoon of cumin and a nice little seasoning of salt so we toast them now intensifying the flavor when they start smoking lightly that's a nice indication that they're ready okay if you grind away so the best thing there let's just stand up close today thank you oh look your tummy's out i thought it was a quail tummy this hand here keeps it nice and firm and you grind that into a nice powder for belly please smells so good doesn't it yeah so to get that in really go around the outside and that grinds it up i've gone around the pestle mortar more times than you kiss boys squeeze the garlic in next a little glove okay then i want you to pour six tablespoons please so that is pomegranate molasses so it's like an aged parsley vinegar but really reduced down give that a nice mix up is it going to be very sweet dad a little taste it's sweet but sour yeah it is it's so good though no take a nice spoon put it inside the quail you can even do this the night before because you pop them in the fridge let the quail marinate anywhere from half an hour to overnight for my ultimate middle eastern dessert it's got to be baklava start by melting butter in a pan chop pistachios in a blender [Music] then combine with caster sugar and lemon zest [Music] brush the melted butter around a small baking tray place half a sheet of phyllo pastry on the base brush well with melted butter and sprinkle with a pistachio mix repeat and press down between layers you're looking to create 30 to 35 layers [Music] then cut the baklava into bite-sized rectangles and bake in a preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes meanwhile make your delicious citrusy syrup simply add water to a pan along with caster sugar and the zest and juice of a lemon simmer for seven to ten minutes making sure the sugar has fully dissolved now to give the cloud a wonderful sweetness remove from the oven and whilst hot pour over the syrup so each layer is gloriously sticky leave the paklava to absorb the syrup for at least 12 hours these delicious sticky treats will keep for a week but they're so moorish they'll be gone in a flash the quails have marinated now they're ready to cook nice hot pan pick up your quail and skin side down first okay get all that nice color and always open them up as well in the pan okay we'll get that skin crisp crispy that's right smell that pomegranate i can really smell it it smells so good you get all that marinade in there you know cook with it as well don't waste it how long on average does it take to cook could you say literally 12-15 minutes in the oven a little touch of water in bring that up to the ball into the oven 180 so 12 to 15 minutes [Applause] okay the final job before serving a herby butter bean salad to go with my quail in pomegranate molasses now one of the things that i love about middle eastern salads is the sort of crunch and the color as well butter beans it's gonna be the base of our salad from their little radishes and sort of top and tail them get them like that and throw them in there's nothing small and dainty in there okay yeah so with the spring onions nice we're gonna use the greens and the whites i'm gonna slice along that way this time to get those nice light shards okay yeah now the croutons are made out of these little pita breads just slice lengthways in with the salad oh yes so this salad is all about texture so cucumber okay and take out the seeds how come you're taking the seeds out it just makes the salad very watery like a shower okay cucumber juice delicious i guess you go yeah you got me going you really got me going no no no oh yeah i've got revision to be doing don't worry this is far more important trust me who needs exams where you can cook for a living you gave me with my exams it's fine it's fine it's fine be a chef for a living have a proper job don't take your things out like that you'll be thumbless let's go now your cucumber in from there take your nice vibrant tomatoes slice down it almost looks like a greek salad as those colors it resembles that that's right and with the celery like before yeah lengthways so we need some mint and parsley i want you sprinkling it in there and really mix it through the herbs give it that nice kind of freshness but i want a bit of a bite in there now i love pomegranate so just carefully open that up okay and then just dot them on top so we got a bit of fruitiness now into the salad for crunch simply cut up whole pita breads fry in a really hot pan with olive oil until wonderfully golden crispy and irresistible out into a sieve okay next a sprinkle of sumac that's a dried fruit from middle east the zest of a lemon and the juice then a drizzle of olive oil and last but not least my crunchy pitter croutons let's make the croutons on well they've gotten hard oh just lift that up and mix in your hands there nice and juicy just with fingertips there you go so you just mix there you go it doesn't crush anything it doesn't crush anything but then let's just take a little bean wow isn't that delicious mm-hmm nice now quail it's got that really sort of toasted almost like a sort of light smells so good barbecue flavor can't wait to try it beef wow and then just finely a bit of lemon zest it just lightens everything up a little bit and it goes so well with the pomegranate now just wow that'll smell better than any boyfriend you'll ever have oh my god i beg to differ okay good let's go how delicious is that so delicious my middle eastern feast of quail with a pomegranate molasses and butter bean salad with batava to follow when dishes are this aromatic and colorful there's no wonder that middle eastern food is always a

Gordon Ramsay's Ultimate Fit Food/Healthy, Lean and Fit...",2022-12-04 22:16:02.927159, kicking things off with a beautiful breakfast of eggs benedict with crispy parmesan the secret behind a great eggs benedict is in the hollandaise so get your pan on because i'm going to cook our hollandaise over a rolling boil with a glass bowl butter just put it on to melt three egg yolks separated from the white tarragon vinegar pop that into the eggs if you can't get tarragon vinegar any white wine vinegar will do just as long as you've got that acidity in there give some bite to the hollandaise put your bowl over the rolling water and just start whisking if the eggs had direct contact with the gas hollandaise will become scrambled egg once you've got that nice creamy texture a nice thick savion start adding your butter nice and slowly a couple of tablespoons of butter in and give that a really nice mix if you don't whisk it enough the egg yolks don't take the butter it causes it to split with more butter using a big balloon whisk like this one makes it easier to incorporate air and helps prevent your mixture from separating all the butter in and the best way to keep hollandaise nice and warm is just leave it to sit over that nice warm water bath and it just keeps at a really nice room temperature a nice pinch of salt fresh pepper and then fresh lemon juice that just really makes it vibrant exciting i want it's like a sort of thick custard i just want it to coat the back of the spoon so it's like you're giving the a nice glossy texture to your beautiful poached egg now as the base for the egg benedict you cannot beat english muffins but the ham i'm gonna change i'm gonna use the most amazing parma ham get your pan nice and hot into the pan it's like posh rashes are bacon beautiful [Music] while i am fried nice and crisp like that is incredible beautiful in salads fantastic for eggs benedict [Music] now keep that pan nice and hot i want all that flavor from the parma ham left in there and rather than toast my muffins i want to put the muffins into the pan and i'm sucking up all that wonderful flavor from that crispy parmesan make sure your muffins are toasted nicely this will prevent them going soggy later look at that nice and crisp now water on to boil for the eggs nicely seasoned really important and then just a little splash of vinegar in the water that helps to set the egg white the minute you crack it in while the water heats up in the pan there's time to get organized lay a nice slice of ham on the base now water's brought up to the ball turn it down and then spin your water around like a little whirlpool then get a little cup so you just drop the cup in and look what happens to the egg gets caught up in the turbulence of the water the secret is not the ball the water rapidly because the strength of the ball can literally explode your egg as they start to move the way up to the top of the water that's a indication that they're cooked take off any excess little bits of egg white and then out onto a piece of tissue paper that just drains off excess water that stops your muffin from getting really soggy but look they're like little beautiful mozzarella balls give them a little season lift them on to your crispy parmesan useful now get a nice spoon of your hollandaise glaze over try and do it in one glazing over the whole egg [Applause] when i tell jack holly and megan and matilda that we're cooking eggs benedict for breakfast they bolt down the stairs and let's be honest who wouldn't run to sit in front of those [Music] special occasion breakfast that would make anyone feel spoiled eggs benedict with crispy parmesan [Music] i'm going to start with the pasta sauce i love the indulgence in this dish if i was doing this for the kids i'd scrap the vodka and just do like a virgin mary but it's a bit of a grown-ups dish now pan nice and hot splash of olive oil onions in seasoning touch of salt and pepper garlic be nice and generous with the garlic it's not just your average tomato sauce it's a royal stunning tomato sauce and you're in for a big treat season your onions and garlic the tabasco that'll give that really nice lift little pinch of celery salt spice that up with worcester sauce it instantly colors the tomatoes goes brilliantly well with a celery salt tabasco and that nice caramelized garlic a little light sprinkling of sugar all the worcester sauce has reduced down we've got this nice sweet spicy sticky garlicky onion base glaze with a couple of spoons of vodka in lovely chopped tomatoes in little touch of water look at the color of that sauce check the seasoning that's delicious bring that up to the boil and cook it out six to eight minutes reduce it down slowly turn down the gas let that simmer with my sauce simmering i can move on to a delicious breadcrumb topping to dress my linguini i'll fry off my breadcrumbs get them nice and crispy but don't put too much oil in there otherwise the bread will just absorb it they become greasy beautifully season them and they go really nice and golden brown 30 seconds before they come out flat leaf parsley roll that through your breadcrumbs and that is going to finish the linguini on top you can hear how crispy they are before i cook the linguini i'm going to make the chili butter that will flavor my lobster get your chili and slice it i want to take advantage of all those seeds chili in a touch of salt a nice clove of garlic i get some parsley [Music] start breaking that down but i'm looking for a lovely garlic chili paste exactly like that now don't overdo it with the butter herb butters are a great way to flavor fish and meat they can be used as a stuffing in dishes like chicken kiev or added towards the end of a dish as a delicious glaze lobsters they're already cooked so firmly place the lobster flat on your board there's a little crisscross here line there and line going across put the point of the knife in and just push through the head turn the lobster around cut through the lobster snap the legs off snap the claws off just get the back of your knife crack them spread that beautiful butter on go into the heads as well and then the claws take off bits of the shell and get little bits of butter in there this can be done way in advance for me the longer that chili butter sits on top of that lobster the better the flavor especially when they hit the grill while my lobster firms up in the fridge i can finish cooking my linguini water brought up to the boil seasoned nicely and a little touch of olive oil now linguine in first that's going to take the longest eight to ten minutes in as linguine starts softening at the bottom just gently turn that around always wait the linguine is nice and soft that way you don't break those nice strands give that a good mix get your lid back on [Music] and bring that to the ball rapidly after eight to ten minutes my linguini should be perfect you want it al dente slightly firm not too chewy absolutely spot on drain that into a colander shake a little bit of water from the pasta into my sauce and she goes start twisting the linguini around i want that bloody mary spicing up the linguini always hold up the center of the pan first and place it onto the plate let go of that nice big lump by doing this you'll get a mountainous pile of spaghetti with more body then generously cover that with your crispy breadcrumbs absolutely beautiful last but not least i need to cook my chilled herb buttered lobsters on a smoking hot griddle that butter's gotten really nice and firm so the idea is snapping that down and grilling the smell of that chili and garlic butter is extraordinary because the lobster's cooked all you're doing is grilling that delicious spicy chili butter you just want that mark of the char quickly on the lobster turn that over smell is incredible now get that on [Music] you can understand why it is proper special occasion food because that is mind-blowing [Music] griddled lobster with chilli and garlic butter served with a boozy bloody merry linguine a sensational special occasion lunch on the menu is a succulent rare beef fillet with salsa velvee served with roasted truffle new potatoes dishes designed to make your special occasion one to remember and to end our ramsey get together with a bang i've enlisted willing sous chef jack to help me make a sublime chocolate and pistachio semi-freddo i know you love chocolate right we'll break this up so it melts nice and evenly all right that goes over a memory and you can't put the chocolate in direct contact with the gas yeah okay otherwise it will split crack four eggs in every blue one of course hold on like that on the side and then your fingers in and pull out okay good nice now you're cracking eggs with one hand nice one i need some muscles okay start whisking and i'll fold in a bit of sugar come on let's do 30 seconds each ready okay come on jack give it some 13 year old welly come on some muscles 10 seconds to go nine eight seven six five four three two one all right here you go you're telling me sugar let's go you see the secret to whisking vigorously is changing hands every ten seconds yep now i'm gonna start the chocolate i'll stir that for you i'm just showing up no just shut it off now the secret behind this is getting it really nice and thick and that's like a stabbing on okay your turn come on change change again yeah of course also the chocolate leave that to slightly cool down a touch from there cream in why putting the cream in separately because i'm gonna get it nice and thick first if you start whisking that i'm gonna get in the vanilla to maximize the flavor from a vanilla bean cut the pot in half lengthways and scrape out those wonderfully aromatic seeds for extra flavor put the pod in as well but remember to take it out once it's infused so we've got three components the melted chocolate yes sugar yes and the eggs whipped up and the cream with the vanilla next mix in your melted chocolate with the sugar and egg saber on so you got a nice rich chocolate ganache smell how delicious i'm now i'm putting the cream and so you just whisk that in now look at that how gorgeous is that looking and that my son is a chocolate semifreddo now they taste [Music] pistachios right sprinkle them in now get your baking tray you line that with cling film so it's easy to pull out once it sets and then you just pour that in that is a real treat so you fold that over okay is this like ice cream in any way yeah as it sets you slice it it's like this nice chocolate ice block delicious then put your semifredo into the freezer for around three hours to set right jack get that pan nice and hot recognize

look great too my first recipe fits the bill perfectly stuffed lamb with spinach and pine nuts stuffed meats are perfect for special occasions they look impressive taste amazing but more importantly they are so simple to do pan on for the stuffing it's a saddle of lamb basically a sort of rolls-royce cut perfectly shaped and it suits stuffing to an absolute tea for the stuffing finely chop an onion garlic nice thin slices oil in onions and garlic in just salt and pepper make sure the stuffing is beautifully seasoned so it helps to season the inside of the lamb now we've got the color on those onions we're gonna throw in some pine nuts and that helps to give a bit of a texture here's where it starts getting really exciting spinach in and just lay the spinach over the pinenuts it looks like a lot of spinach that's gonna condense and disappear almost instantly there's so much more flavor in spinach when you saute it as opposed to steaming it or boiling it gas off look at that now to bring that together no eggs no breadcrumbs crumpled feta over the spinach feta cheese adds a beautifully salty sharp and creamy flavor what this does it brings our stuffing together now open up the lamb keep those little fillets to the side that's the channel that we want to stuff so i want to just open that up a little bit there salt and pepper lightly and before we put our stuffing in we're going to season it with sour sumac is a wonderful lemony spice that goes brilliantly with lamb and you can get it in most big supermarkets and it sort of cuts through that thick rich sweetness of the lamb open up that lamb there take a spoon if you're preparing this for the day ahead then let the stuffing cool down it's inevitable when you start rolling it and tying it something's gonna squeeze out so load up the ends take these beauties these little fillets and just support that stuffing and sort of increase that beautiful tunnel and then from there over there and bring that towards you and then roll like i said some of the stuff is going to come out now to tie it first off around the side and don't worry about some flash butcher's knot just tie it one in the middle you can get butcher string from your local butcher or at cookware shops i got two ties go too thai it just forces all that stuffing out of the lamb when it's in the oven nice now we just season the top of it roll the joint to make sure all the skin gets seasoned now you think normally that just goes in the oven like that that's how my mum would do it but get your tray onto the gas oil in get it really nicely colored none of your stuffing is coming out of the sides really important look at that color beautiful does kickstart the roasting process gas off into the oven cook for 45 to 55 minutes depending on how pink you want your lamb lift the lamb out of the fat to rest resting it raised up in the tin will stop it cooking but not cool it down too quickly and means you won't lose any of those lovely juices next i'm making a simple but sophisticated accompaniment for the lamb top and tell the cucumber peel it cut the cucumber into three and just core taking out all that it's just sort of watery seedy and it spoils the flavor slice the cucumber cucumber in really nice way of making a cheap and cheerful cucumber look glamorous we're gonna dress that cucumber with a nice fresh yogurt a couple of tablespoons next some fresh mint dressing a touch of salt a touch of pepper and then pomegranate molasses that just sweetens it up finish that with lemon mix that up lamb it's rested carefully take off the string and then just gently pull them back straightened edge knife that's going to cut through that crispy fat on the outside instantly i tied it purposely so i can get my portion control from the lines hold it nice and firmly look at your line where the string was and look this one is going to be amazing lay and down just in those two slices there it proves that stuffing meats is for special occasions because that is a saddle of lamb at its absolute best stuffing meats and fish not only makes them look fantastic it also gives them an extra added flavor dimension too once you've mastered the technique you'll be able to turn out dishes that will guarantee you'll have an unforgettable feast here are three more of my favorite easy stuff dishes that are perfect for any feast first up chicken with garlic and chestnut stuffing packed with flavor and earthy richness for the stuffing fry finely chopped onion garlic and celery in hot olive oil next add pine nuts which have a lovely creamy taste and chopped earthy cooked chestnuts both add a wonderfully chewy texture and richness to stuffings season and add chopped parsley [Music] then stir in cooked wild rice next take a whole debone chicken it's fitting to do at home but if you ask your butcher will do it for you and pile the stuffing mixture along the center now simply roll the chicken up tightly and tie it with your butcher string then roast in a hot oven for just over an hour [Music] simply carve into magnificent thick slices so impressive so easy and trust me this is a dish guaranteed to get a fantastic reaction on any occasion whole stuffed fish will always make an impression my next recipe is sea bass stuffed with fennel lemon and capers first place a whole gutted sea bass on foil and season the fish inside and out sea bass is known as the king of the seas and has a wonderful sweet white flesh start the stuffing with sliced fennel its aniseed flavour works brilliantly with the fish next add capers fresh dill and slices of lemon then dot in knobs of butter lastly add a splash of white wine which helps to steam the fish and creates a lovely sauce and seal tightly into a parcel this locks in all the juices and flavor then simply bake in a medium oven unwrap and hear your guess ooh and ah with delight prepared in 10 minutes wrap for intense flavor a stunning sea bass that's bound to create a stir [Music] my next dish throws a spanish twist on a classic english roast pork stuffed with manchego and mandrillo use a pork loin roasting joint lay the joint skin side down and cut three quarters of the way into the flesh creating space for the stuffing next thinly sliced spanish manchego cheese this has a wonderful buttery nutty taste and is fantastic for stuffing as it melts brilliantly sliced spanish mimbrello quince jelly sweet and perfumed is the perfect partner for the saltiness of the cheese then simply layer your cheese and quince jelly into the pork add sage leaves for a strong and deliciously bitter flavour roll the meat up and tie with butcher string next add more sage leaves and some aromatic fresh thyme to a roasting tin then lay the pork on top skin side up cut a bob of garlic in half and wedge it under the meat the garlic wedges help lit the pork so it roasts to perfection and will add a sweet depth of flavor to your gravy drizzle with olive oil season and roast for just over an hour with the heat on high for the first 20 which helps get the skin crispy and golden once cooked leave the pork to rest as you make a stunning gravy simply place the roasting tin over a medium heat add a lug of sherry and delays using the roasting juices gives your gravy maximum flavor simmer and reduce for a few minutes then pour in the incredible resting juices from the pork finally strain the silky rich gravy over the stuffed loin and serve immediately stuff through with incredible flavor rich sweet and aromatic a stunning centerpiece fit to grace any table anywhere anytime three dishes stuffed to perfection proof you can have food that's simple to pull off but looks incredible and tastes a million bucks amazing

dishes that will guarantee you'll have an unforgettable feast cooking's all about being bold and adventurous and this dish is exciting because it's slowly cooked and the longer it cooks the more flavoursome it becomes marinating the lamb first chilis we're going to use a mixture of red and green take off the tops and just slice in garlic crushed don't worry about chopping these ultra fine just get it in there cooking for up to three hours everything sort of blends and almost sort of purees itself together smoked paprika goes brilliantly well with the chilis two teaspoons in a touch of dried oregano some little cumin seeds the blend and the fragrance that they give out is extraordinary they release a little oil as well and helps to tenderize the lamb a touch of salt pepper cinnamon that sort of sweetens up the lamb olive oil just a tablespoon and the olive oil helps to sort of stick all those wonderful spices to the lamb jump in just start really rubbing at this stage you can leave the lamb to marinade for anything from half an hour to overnight allowing the spices to really penetrate the meat giving amazing results when you tuck in delicious vegetables carrots and onions and that's it sliced secret slicing vegetables for brazing is not getting too thin you slice the onions too thin they burn you've got that horrible char taste on that slow braised grazing it's just a chef's term that means cooking in liquid on a low heat making the meat incredibly moist and beautifully tender so the secret of braising is having a really nice thick durable pan get that nice and hot just a touch of olive oil lamb in hold the bone because you're in control then into the pan i want that white fat to start rendering so it'll add more fat therefore making it a lot more flavoursome as it braises chilies cinnamon in mix that up and don't be scared you're not burning this you're sort of searing the lamb shanks and this is the important part right at the very beginning we're getting the color on the lamb which washes off as it braises in the oven so be generous with that color vegetables in wow and then a couple of baileys so now you lift the lamb up and get the lamb sat on top of the vegetables now just glaze the pan with red wine the glazing means that you're you're cleaning the bottom of the pan and you're getting that amazing flavor washed off and lifted up into that sauce can really transform that dish always delays then bring to the boil and cook for about 10 minutes to reduce the wines reduce down by half now with the stock bring that stock back up to the ball and then into the oven now don't cover it when you cover it all the condensation comes off the lid your lamb becomes gray all this effort and that exciting spice gets washed away no lid and into the oven for three hours a slow cook on a low heat of 160 degrees gives the spices time to work and transform the meat so it's mouthwateringly tender now look at those out on to a plate you can just see that meat sliding down juicy and crazy tender grab it by the the shank roll around that rich delicious sauce look at that and get your sauce nice beautiful just get some mint don't chop it just pick that fresh mint and let it snow and there you go a very spicy delicious melting in the mouth lamb shank amazing one of the secrets to slow cooking is to be robust and really get stuck in big bold flavors work really well so don't be precious this is gutsy cooking at its absolute best these are lamb breasts a beautiful cheap cut and it's sort of tucked alongside the rib they've been boned out the skin has been taken off we're going to roll them stuff them and braise them braising simply means cooking in liquid on a low heat making the meat divinely tender now open them up and give them a really good season season them both sides inside and out really important it doesn't look like a real weighty dense cut of meat but once it's beautifully slow braised it's just like melting lamb it's incredible i'm going to season the breasts with some dried oregano put a heat in there some chili flakes [Music] lemon zest put some amazing salted anchovies in there now they almost melt inside the lamb so the balance of flavours work beautifully now pull it down towards you and roll that nice and tightly that's what i'm looking for string i just need to tie them three times one at each end and one in the middle i fell in love with this dish years ago when i first started working in paris because we had all the lamin from the pyrenees the nice thing is they can be done the day before pan on olive oil in get their oil nice and hot lamin really important to get some nice color on there whilst they're browning slice the onion the lamb's gonna be cooking for two and a half hours so don't slice the onions too thinly otherwise they'll burn garlic and leave whole got a color on them look at that beautiful take them out onions in and garlic straight in lovely that's the secret about slow braising you never change pans why all the goodness is in that one pan a few chili seeds in there oregano nice pinch a little bit of lemon in there i'm gonna do the onions what i did to the lamb [Music] next my capers fry them off get them exploding at the bottom of the pan they get nice and crispy next my black olives now white wine mmm bring that up to the boil deglazing the pan as well i rinse in the bottom of that pan and now the flavour in there is just extraordinary now where that tomatoes [Music] puncture those plum tomatoes [Music] then simply place the lamb breast back in the pot and remember to taste [Music] that's nice lid on into the oven 170 two two and a half hours and forget about it [Music] wow beautiful all that has reduced down to this amazing nice tomato sauce and the lamb has kept its color look at that it's braised beautifully very carefully get your little bits there slice off pull off the little bits of string this is why i get really excited the secret is not to slice it too thinly look at that i can smell the lemon it's hard to believe when you slice through the center there that that is a very cheap cut of meat i'm salivating i love this i mean it's just incredible pick up the tomatoes and the olives and the onions an amazing rich sauce take your lamb sort of just sit it on it looks incredible and that for me is why chefs get so excited with cheap cuts because the end results are incredible breast of lamb with lemon anchovies chili and oregano you

baby you can do it now time you peed off all those wonderful little buds see so as we stuff the chicken with the fresh thyme the chickpeas become sort of fat and juicy from all that wonderful flavor chickpea stuffing done next we're going to make the herb butter to flavor the skin now what's that tarragon what's slightly vinegary yeah yeah a little bit anna cd yep so imagine that flavour going into the chicken that's going to be delicious now nice soft butter in with the tarragon is that lovely yeah now i want you gently to put your fingers through there and just so we get that butter under

at that please open them door thank you there she goes beautiful good job thank you really good nice to see holly get our hands there do i i think we all agree for dessert it's an incredible but easy hazelnut meringue tower guaranteed to wow your mates start with the basic meringue separate four egg whites [Music] and whisk [Music] gradually add caster sugar [Music] until the mix forms stiff glossy peaks gently fold in ground and chopped hazelnuts a trick we use in the restaurants is to use the mix to stick baking sheets down which makes them easy to spread and stops the sheets blowing around [Music] top your meringues with more finely chopped hazelnuts and bake for 25 minutes and the trick to stop them cracking is to turn the oven off and let them cool inside for the filling melt dark chocolate in a bowl over simmering water and slightly cool whip the cream until it forms soft peaks and gently fold in three quarters of the melted chocolate until combined build your towel with alternate layers of chocolate cream and meringue [Music] finally drizzle over the remaining melted chocolate to decorate a simple yet luxurious dessert your friends will love but be warned they'll all

do we have to use a whisk not just a spoon the purpose of using a whisk is so it can emulsify and more importantly you're bringing all the ingredients together taste it's so yummy that is delicious

chickpeas and that is a roast chicken fit for a kingdom this looks really yummy this is my ultimate home-cooked french dinner first job my chicken frigge tilly would you mind helping daddy with the chicken fricassee please we're gonna start off with browning all the chicken off nicely pan on get that nice and hot what i want you to do for me first is to season the chicken with salt and pepper please thank you so that's on one side then we turn the chicken over so we season it on the other side salt good girl and pepper nice now this is almost like a chicken stew okay what's that there [Music] um time time good girl what's that one there that one's real that's right originally and because this is quite a rustic french dish we don't need to chop everything so you get the garlic and you just bash it like that now smell right so that's nice and hot put a tablespoon of olive oil in there a couple of gloves one two good girl put the chicken in and you lay away you got that nice and brown i'm getting good at this you are skin side down so we got the color on the skin now i just want you to cut the mushrooms in half the belly please okay these are chestnut mushrooms there are lots of different kinds of mushrooms out there there are lots and lots of different types of mushrooms which one's your favorite one of my favorites is the giro mushroom i like mushrooms that are a bit bigger than this and um some dinners with mum we cut out the middle put pesto and cheese in it and then we bake them ah so i want you to sprinkle the pancetta over the chicken please good girl nice mushrooms not yet because i'm gonna get some color on the chicken first okay and as that pancetta starts to cook down it puts a really nice flavor on the chicken yeah so we're sort of soaking everything okay all right garlic in please good girl just throw them in and i want you to sprinkle the mushrooms on top of that good girl and then there's the rosemary you can get your fingers like that and you pull it down you take it all off hold it put it down good girl so now you've got the nice little rosemary sprigs and we do the same with the thyme now the thyme flour is a little bit smaller what different flavors do they give so the thyme is a little bit sweeter okay and the rosemary a little bit more savoury which ones you like i like them both because they both get a nice smell don't they so bay leaf in i'd like you to put that rosemary and thyme in there please lovely sprinkle it over right i'd like you to stand back now because we're going to flambe this i do not want to get those little slippers caught on fire what are the names rampa and judy julia nice okay great ready yeah in with a brandy and then just tilt the pan gently [Music] whoa whoa how cool is that a magical like a cauldron all the cognac has been flambe so there's no raw alcohol anywhere so we've got a really nice deep rich flavor i'm going to add my chicken stock you know rampo likes that not my slipper rump for the dog ah rumple the dog well he likes chicken stock yes when he's a good boy he gets um he gets it in his um with his biscuit it's gone in like wow really quickly simmer and reduce the stock for around 10 minutes now we're gonna cook the most amazing potatoes soda potatoes are really simple to make and absolutely delicious start by slicing the potatoes into finger whipped pieces then parboil them for five to six minutes when you cook something like rosemary or thyme or basil does it slowly let off the flavor into the bottle very much so in a hot pan add a tablespoon of goose fat and saute the potatoes until they turn golden and add in shallots garlic rosemary and thyme that goes in over top that goose fat now is starting to fry the potatoes you just leave that sat there to complete my ultimate french dinner my version of a classic a glorious lavender creme caramel for dessert the first job is the lavender sugar you can buy this ready-made or simply add dried edible sprigs of lavender to caster sugar and store you can also try this trick with vanilla pods and cinnamon to bring new subtle flavors to sweets and bacon [Music] for the creme caramel melt plain caster sugar until it turns dark golden pour into ramekins sprinkle with lavender flowers and cool now to make a simple custard gently heat whole milk in a pan until steaming meanwhile whisk together egg vanilla seeds and lavender sugar until golden and fluffy then gradually pour the hot milk into the mix whisking continuously until the custard is smooth and creamy to set cook in a water bath or bamboo a good tip is to line a roasting tin with a cloth to stop the ramekins jiggling around pour your custard boiling water around the ramekins until halfway up the sides then cook in a preheated oven for around 30 minutes until set cool in the fridge then when you're ready to serve dip the ramekins in hot water to loosen the creme caramel [Music] ebola lavender clean caramel [Music] look at that chicken now so i'm just gonna turn the gas right down and put the lid on just like that but leave a little bit so it can net out some stuff so i can let out some steam that's right now what i'd like to do is to chop daddy some parsley crunch it up nicely tuck your fingers in and take your time [Music] now my hands have got lots of different flavors all those wonderful flavors you could almost be french sprinkle that on there good girl nice messy buckle nice now potatoes i can tell jack's gonna love this is he looks the nest doesn't it smells delicious look at that i could smell that even before you took the lid off let's kill my darling good job by the way thank you i can't wait for the others to try it i hope that i love it this is my ultimate french dinner chicken fricassee

If you liked this clip...",2022-12-03 22:16:02.927159, more exciting than breakfast and a lot more enjoyable to cook brunch is ideal for sharing first up my simple and delicious frittata eggs are great they are so versatile and once you've mastered how to cook them trust me the door then opens to a wide range of delicious options this is like a triple omelette but a lot more ingredients than a normal mesh we'll start off with some lovely smoked bacon slice the bacon bacon in no salt little touch of pepper start off on a high heat get that bacon really nice and crispy otherwise you just boil the bacon and it's got that soft unpleasant texture in the frittata turn down the gas and now start adding your veg roughly chop a red pepper and add it to the pan the peppers and the bacon take the longest so they've always got to go in first now soak them off and the peppers have been cooked now from that sort of rendered fat from the bacon and then the spring onions just bunch them up slice them i want them on an angle so they come like little green diamonds spring onions in now for the eggs cracking the eggs for that size pan seven or eight eggs i want to fill it right to the very top and more importantly when i turn this out i want it like a gato nice and thick so slice through and seal those wonderful verge [Music] i'm gonna season the eggs with some parmesan cheese be quite generous because it adds a really nice saltiness [Music] fresh ground pepper and then whisk whisk up those eggs nicely then add peas to the pan and to give the dish a wonderful aromatic freshness some fragrant chopped basil i want to chop that sort of roughly because i want to see those flecks of green going in i want it looking charming and how many times have you seen a dull omelet frittatas in my mind really helped encapsulate the magic of having savory eggs cooked beautifully but with texture now just before we add the eggs i've got this beautiful little goat's cheese and it's strong and powerful so i want to slice it into little chunks and then just have it dotted around i want to discover these little pockets of creamy goat's cheese now slowly add the eggs fill that right up and get your spoon now just let all that egg go down to the bottom bring it back up to the boil and sort of clean around the sides and then some of this delicious salty creamy goat's cheese over the top now i want it melting like a perfect slice of cheese on toast nice now from there turn the grill on for four to five minutes now just looking at that delicious take a little paring knife and just make sure it's released on the sides just take your panel tap that will hopefully release the frittata from the bottom of the pan now the board over the pan turn that gently and just shake say a little prayer and lift off beautiful now from there on there it's there look now slice through you can see how soft and creamy that is in the center and that goat's cheese is just melting almost like a little sauce inside it's so exciting but more importantly so easy to do it's got texture it's got creaminess and that for me will beat any omelette for brunch serve with a stack of hot buttered toast and a steaming pot of coffee this easy frittata turned the humble egg into the perfect dish for kicking off the weekend [Music] soft fiery and irresistible spicy pancakes one of the secrets to good cooking is learning to use your imagination when it comes to brunches you don't have to stick to the old standbys these delicious spicy pancakes are really great alternative but more importantly so easy to do start off by toasting your cumin [Music] it's a dry roast basically non-stick pan just a touch of seasoning the salt helps to dry out the cumin even more and then fresh ginger slice them nice and thinly stack it back up and then just slice nice little thin slices in there and then keep that bunched up shake the chilli removing the seeds will prevent things getting too hot now garlic nice now add olive oil to your toasted cumin seeds and then with the garlic ginger and chili lovely and it feels strange when you talk about garlic for breakfast but the time i spent in india everybody was eating something savory for breakfast it was extraordinary into your bowl and set aside next the pancake filling add olive oil to a hot pan mustard seeds in now they'll start dancing the minute they hit the pan then finely slice an onion onions in a little teaspoon of turmeric sprinkle that in and look at the color an instant change leftover potatoes just slice them the smell is incredible potatoes in now spread the potatoes across the pan while the potatoes stained i want them sort of absorbing all that really nice turmeric actually like a sponge season those potatoes and it really helps to bring out the spice beautifully [Music] they're ready turn off the gas and let them sit there and absorb all those flavors back to the pancake batter add plain flour to your cooled garlic chili ginger and cumin seeds touch salt and pepper nothing worse than the bland pancake one whole egg milk hold the jug with one hand and whisk we have a secret to get that really nice smooth paste but whisking that egg first and brings it together and then you're milking don't put all the milk in because then you're gonna get a lumpy pancake mix and if you put less milk in it really helps it not going lumpy look at that milk here and the secret for me is to have a nice thin mix now just a little teaspoon of oil that helps to bring a nice crispy edge to the mixture now just taste it that's the texture pan on the larger the pan the better it helps to create a nice thin even surface i want that mix going all the way around the pan before you put the mixture into the pan make sure you give your pancake mix a really nice stir pan it's nice and hot turn down the gas a touch of olive oil get that nice whisk with one hand pan to the mix in one and a half ladles and then roll it round so it's really nice and thin i want to see the ginger the garlic that's what i'm looking for in there now back onto the heat it only starts to remove from the bottom of the pan and lifts itself up once it's cooked these little bubbles confirm that it's just starting to lift off the pan a little shake that releases it and then just shake it to the end and toss if you haven't got the confidence tossing then use a spatula and turn it over now that's exactly what i want that nice sort of crisp edge around the side the color on the pancake is so important now roll it around and just let it slide out beautifully now for the exciting part filling them take your potatoes just sort of have a really nice imaginary line and then just very carefully roll that nice and tightly tuck it underneath there pull it back and roll useful the delicious pancakes are ready to eat but with a simple dipping sauce there'll be a real treat just mix chopped coriander with natural yogurt that's really nice cooling agent sit there on the side and that for me is a great brunch delicious spicy pancakes amazing

Gordon Ramsay's Ultimate Fit Food/Healthy, Lean and...",2022-12-03 22:16:02.927159, now we're going to make an amazing butter and this is sort of the start of the the most important part keeping that bird incredibly moist soft butter a touch of salt and pepper little touch of olive oil in there that stops the butter from burning next add the zest of two lemons and their juice this gives the flavored butter a wonderful citrus zing three cloves of garlic turkey's a very delicate dainty meat and that's why i want the garlic pureed so it sort of disintegrates and flavors a turkey gently without becoming too overpowering then add a generous handful of chopped parsley wow that smells incredibly light give that a good mix turkey's a very very very lean bird and it dries out so it's so important to make sure that we help it to cook perfectly butter done now prepare the turkey we'll season the bird inside the cavity and pepper next half two onions and pop them in as they roast they steam inside the bird giving it a lovely sweetness put in the lemon and a couple of bay leaves for their bittersweet spicy flavour [Music] we're sort of lining the inside of the turkey with these fantastic sort of flavors you can see the bird is upright and it's looking sort of like it's standing to attention now it's time to add the flavoured butter just very very carefully open up the skin go through over the back of the breast and keep the skin intact the idea is to gently loosen the skin with your fingers so the butter can be stuck underneath it now once you've loosened all the skin off the top of the thighs turn the bird round and just go through here again hand up and just release a little bit but don't completely break it because i don't want all that butter to run out right from there now take your butter put it into a bowl it smells amazing lemony citrusy and just sort of flatten it and stick that in there underneath one side now once you've got it in there pull back the skin and just use that to sort of slide all the way down what we want to do now is line the top of the breast with all that butter there that butter is going to keep the turkey breast really seriously moist turn the bird round and finish covering the breasts with the butter turkeys originally came from north america and they are best young and plump my favorite breed for christmas is either north of black or norfolk bronze both of which have a wonderful gamey taste take the rest of the butter and carefully massage over the breast legs and wings you can do all this the night before and simply cover the turkey with tim fall and keep it in the fridge ready to be cooked on christmas day into the tray a little touch of olive oil now olive oil on top again that protects it gets that skin really nice and crispy and it stops the butter from burning now in the oven at 220 for 10 minutes to get really nice and brown quickly in she goes beautiful [Music] that smells fantastic after 10 minutes take the turkey out of the oven and baste then cover the breasts with smoked streaky bacon what i want to do is add a little bit more flavor i'm already starting to think about my gravy so the bacon protects it stops it from drying out but it's going to start to really give my gravy a wonderful base turn down the oven to 180 degrees this five kilogram bird will feed eight people comfortably it needs roasting for two and a half hours or half an hour per kilo basting every so often [Music] back in and now she's on the way look at that beautiful that smells fantastic wow look at that beautiful that is 90 of your work done there to test the turkey is cooked stick a knife into the bottom of the thigh and if the juices run clear it's done the secret now is to let the turkey rest uncovered for two and a half hours as the meat relaxes it reabsorbs its juices making it succulent and tender plus it'll be easier to carve it might seem like a long time to let it rest but remember the turkey doesn't need to be piping hot because i'm serving it with hot gravy that looks like a million dollars let that rest because the flavor will be 10 times more exciting once it's rested as that turkey's resting i want to make the most amazing gravy when i say amazing i really do mean amazing drain the excess fat from the roasting tray and put it back on the heat then remove the bacon from the top of the turkey and the roasted onions from the cavity look at them my god they smell amazing finally take out the roasted lemon first of all cut up the bacon lovely bacon into the tray you know how crispy that is that's the start of our gravy the onion look at it beautiful doesn't get any better than that chop that up onion and bacon in that smells incredible when i first got the chance to cook christmas lunch for the chefs in paris they taught me one crucial thing i was only 21 at the time and they made me rest the turkey for as long as i cooked it so i cooked it for three hours and i rested it for three hours what a difference incredible next chop up the roasted lemon and add to the tray put in a couple of sprigs of rosemary to give it a lovely aromatic punch and fry then add three chopped tomatoes which helps thicken the gravy and give it a lovely fresh taste [Music] now it's time to really get the turkey flavor into the gravy snap off the wing take off all your little trimmings all these little bits here add that into your crafty these are the bits we never use everyone throws them away off there that little baby there take him off i want that bang flavor delicious try that off it smells incredible next pour in the dry cider this adds a lovely subtle apple flavor that really lifts the taste of the turkey meat as the cider starts to reduce pour in the delicious resting juices from the roasted turkey wow there you go the most amazing flavor [Music] when the liquid has reduced by half crush the vegetables and the turkey pieces with a masher to extract the maximum amount of flavor and basically what's happening now is that we're giving the gravy a little bit of body pour in the chicken stock and reduce again in now a little taste wow i mean just close your eyes and wow it oozes flavor and turkey now sieve it use the back of the ladle to push it through the sieve extracting every last drop of flavor pop in a sprig of rosemary and leave to infuse ready for the finishing touch [Music] simply add crushed walnuts to the bottom of the gravy boat and ladle in the hot gravy i'm just going to do again a little twist the potatoes we do need some goose fat no no goose fat and we're going to do a really nice lightly spiced roast potato okay little chili flake really yeah chili flake just put a little bit of heat in there for the christmas lunch yup chili flake and a little bit of turmeric i can't believe you're doing roast potatoes for chili now would you be so kind just to give them a little cuts cut their peeled potatoes into quarters and put into salted cold water in they go okay bring them up to the boil and simmer for around eight minutes drain and let them steam then season with salt and pepper on there and just a little teaspoon of chili flake no that's the sort of thing i would make for supper and a saturday night or something really chilly flakes in add a teaspoon of turmeric turmeric is a member of the ginger family it stains the potatoes a wonderful golden color and has a lovely earthy taste next drizzle in a little olive oil and shake to coat them just let them roll around yeah that smells nice beautiful could you get me the stuffing please from the fridge put in a preheated baking tray with extra olive oil and cook at 200 degrees celsius for about 40 minutes give it a little shake to make sure they don't stick and then i'll just stick the stuffing up on top yeah now that will take roughly about the same time as potatoes stuffing in potatoes done nice why are you gonna play with the kids i will do here okay see you shortly thank you bye-bye now they look and smell fantastic look at that beautiful chicken with garlic and chestnut stuffing packed with flavor and earthy richness for the stuffing fry finely chopped onion garlic and celery in hot olive oil next add pine nuts which have a lovely creamy taste and chopped earthy cooked chestnuts both add a wonderfully chewy texture and richness to stuffings season and add chopped parsley [Music] then stir in cooked wild rice [Music] next take a whole deboned chicken it's fitting to do at home but if you ask your butcher will do it for you and pile the stuffing mixture along the center now simply roll the chicken up tightly and tie it with your butcher's string [Music] then roast in a hot oven for just over an hour [Music] simply carve into magnificent thick slices so impressive so easy and trust me this is a dish guaranteed to get a fantastic reaction on any occasion turkey the one hit wonder i'm absolute amazing bird stuff onion orange garlic thyme and bailey season truffle butter this little beauty helps to take the turkey to a different division these cost 50 quid for that size yes it's expensive but boy is it worth it [Music] [Applause] don't chop the truffle too small because we want to taste and identify the truffle parsley tarragon salt touch of pepper tablespoon of olive oil and that stops the butter from burning take your piping bag and fill it separate skin from meat [Music] bag in butter massage salt pepper olive oil roast citrus breadcrumbs [Music] pancetta [Applause] onion [Applause] thyme good old chef trick and pull down and just peel it off his lovely flowers pine nuts butter [Music] [Applause] bread orange lemon [Music] [Applause] and to start browning sprinkle the orange and lemon breadcrumbs lemon juice [Applause] there we go beautiful rest tin foil keeps it nice and warm and it cool down slowly so the breasts become really nice and moist calm what you can smell of course is that amazing truffle absolutely beautiful turkey with truffle butter and citrus breadcrumbs done

place it on top olive oil season leave that to marinade and that's ready for the pan cooking the venison you've got to be a lot more delicate than you were if you're cooking a fillet of beef because it's very lean hardly any fat on there hot pan olive oil keep on rolling it around should become nice and springy and slightly bouncy and that indicates that it's slightly pink but a little bit firm in the center butter baste the venison and then just take it out of the pan and just spoon it over there leave that to sit now for the sauce we're gonna do a really nice sweet and sour pepper red and yellow pepper just stand the pepper up on its base and just cut around like we're segmenting an orange and look you've got the seeds there fit for the bin olive oil in peppers into the pan a little bit of salt and by having the skin on the peppers it doesn't allow the peppers to become too soft and overcooked it keeps them really nice and robust thyme this is where it gets really exciting white

cooked let's go on there like that let's go it's olive oil let's go time to kill some giant crabs they're big they're ugly and they're coming together it's the invasion of the monster king crab king crab is the largest crustacean in the world and they're heading for britain norway has a massive problem with these huge giant king crabs they're just breeding and breeding and breeding reducing the fish stocks and causing a huge problem all the king crab that come to england are frozen so i'm now going to catch one kill one and see what it actually tastes like fresh from the sea two flights and eight hours later i landed kirk and s where i met my local crab hunter lars peter oy welcome to northern oregon thank you yeah very happy to be here never been this far up it's [ __ ] freezing here there's only one way to get around in norwegian lapland and it's not my car we're heading over the mountains and down to the frozen fjord which is where the crabs hang out unbelievable you get like a child again you know yeah that was extraordinary good to see you 50 000 crabs live under this ice and if you want to catch one we're gonna have to dive down beneath it did you ever try ice diving i've never been nice diving i've done lots of diving but it's a special kind of diving and you need the special skills but uh we will try now don't make the hole too small i want to get out easy just in case those [ __ ] things are huge will we stay completely dry hopefully yeah so i've never dived in a dry suit before that's one leg there's not any water get in there is that feel like a big [ __ ] condom at least you're very safe oh god bloody condom oh that was hard work though yeah right ice diving can be extremely dangerous as it's so easy to get disorientated in the freezing dark water i'm [ __ ] myself when you fetch a crab you should just grab one of the legs the claws are very strong so they can snap your finger and even uh yeah more so if i'm swimming over one yeah watch out for my widget yeah it's gonna be cold down there it'll be frozen i don't know what it snapped off okay [ __ ] me it's freezing oh [ __ ] my [ __ ] boots we could get hypothermia if we stay down too long so we've got to be quick but that's easier said than done i can see the crabs but i can't see the surface these freakish beasts grow up to six foot wide and have no natural predators so it's down to us to bring their invasion under control so a lot harder than i thought it would be yeah the size of the thing good sizing and look at her beautiful my balls feel like two big [ __ ] ice cubes laza showed me how to catch a giant crab now i'm going to show him a new way to eat it but first i've got to kill it okay yeah yeah then it's dead actually now it's bleeding out yep yep we cut off the legs and boil them in seawater for 15 minutes discarding the body which isn't that good to eat because the quality of the king crab is so delicious it doesn't need much more no so i'm just going to do something very very simple with the creme fresh mayonnaise and some tarragon and some lime okay i'm making the sauce by mixing equal amounts of mayonnaise and creme fraiche with some lime zest salt and pepper roughly chopped tarragon and freshly squeezed lime juice delicious nice lovely you can try to to break the main joint here and if you're lucky keep it whole the meat will come out like this lovely it's the size of a lobster tail isn't it now look at that that smells and looks amazing this is what i've been waiting for beautiful that's delicious my god i actually now think i prefer it lobster so much softer and sweeter is there any more what do i have to go back down and get another one maybe you have to go down again okay now i'm pregnant right what do you think of the venison i liked it very much the texture was fantastic it melted in your mouth really good i quite liked how crispy it was on the outside um do you get a chance to watch food programs on telly um i do a bit uh-huh but i i to be honest too many men uh there is the sort of saint denia of these worlds yes there is dania fantastic yeah but let's be honest she does seem a little less steady on her feet nowadays yes ready there is nothing wrong with that delia is passionate lots of people think delia are very controlled is passionate and she's passionate about football but if a man was passionate about football you'd be going yes that was a difference the reason why i'm sort of concerned about the dealers of this world is the fact that we've got no one else coming through no that's right no young ones coming through i knew the younger ones yeah have a quick look at this oh bless fabulous hair look at that yeah then you add a little tawny port i'm not going to explain to you why now it'll be quite clear to you in a moment move that candle will you johnny love this worth a ton thank you to me who did you support didn't you of course one small wine glass full of tawny poor that's all right then she was ahead of the time she's knowledgeable and she was she was out there yes i'm gonna search high and low to find a talented female that's good enough to fill the shoes of funny credit and then finally get her own slot on the f words i need somebody with triple a fanny factor unique discipline tenacious and some of them love beating the cup out there for this top top fanny right andy all we have to do okay is visit the website and log on get details and send me a three minute segment of their fanny credit action funny videos is that what you're actually asking people to send in show me that they can cook talk understand and they've got a lucid funny factor yes okay would you be interested in my fanny i can't wait for you to find this person yeah i can't wait it's right time yeah yeah okay all right gordon one last place no i just thought the mate was absolutely stunning it was well cooked it was well seasoned and um i'm never gonna eat venison again because i don't think that can be surpassed it took a very long time for it to come to be honest i think that would put me off pain it tastes really nice i don't think the peppers are that sweet and sour but they taste very good okay result of the main course come over tom please yeah okay tom i think we did 50s 50 okay the dining room decided to pay for 34 out of 15 main courses that means 16 refused to pay why um mainly the meat was right the meat was dry yeah i'd like to think that i stopped all that stuff going out so i think that's a little bit harsh in terms of 16 yeah not agreeing to pay for it i listen it's not perfect but it's a comeback on the back of the starters yes yes okay so now dessert 50 out of 50. okay let's go next on the menu i take on natasha kaplinsky the recipe challenge would

piping bag right finger in and just put it on top of that little point there yeah that stops the point from burning right time for dessert for fiddler rolls with chantilly cream and chocolate sauce for fitter rolls throwback to the 80s something that we've all forgotten about how to make the perfect shoe pastry first and foremost important turn the oven on 125 mils of milk 200 ml of water in to the pan it's important that we bring it to the boil slowly butter caster sugar salt it stops it from becoming over sweet and gives a really nice sort of rustic flavor to it off the heat 150 grams of plain flour vigorously fold that flour in back onto the heat like that look beautiful just hanging off the spoon cool eggs it's really important you put the eggs in one at a time therefore you get this really nice incorporation of the white and the yolk look beautiful piping bag one nice lump and look just coming through there she is there greaseproof paper stop them from sticking to the tray down push and twist away perfect now finger into a bowl of water and just push down those little pointy bars this stops with it all from burning into the oven 18 to 20 minutes chocolate sauce we use between sort of 60 and 70 percent pure cherry the better the chocolate the better the sauce simple as that and the secret now is to melt this chocolate over a pan of simmering water that will melt within three to four minutes butter honey just look now that's beautiful smooth and just this wonderful texture there take it off the heat and that that looks perfect milk out creme chantilly basically a really nice flavored cream icing sugar vanilla and then mix it nice piping bag push in fit a roll generously fill up to see the cream bouncing back at you and just stick them together lovely icing sugar chocolate sauce into a jug buffet rolls with chocolate sauce and chantelle cream done come on guys the customers are waiting yes come on and the secret of using fresh minted of course it's a thousand times more exciting than vanilla extract and the flavor is extraordinary yes yes chef you're a possible you should always be using fresh cheese yeah good now i use that for my caster sugar afterwards there you go good all right guys start playing up two break away play it up two back up please let's go okay quickly i'll break away let's go come on fight please yes chocolate leaves right a question four four of you yes while storm french was waiting for her main course yes yeah her and the table played shag or died which one do you think won the horn dawn has definitely got the horn tom it was really cool what do you think lenny would think of that congrats right be afraid the teeth are back and the voice fast food i hate it a big mac will never pass my lips i'm a food snob there you are i've said it now i've always associated salt and sugar with dreadful common fast food until now when prince charles allegedly called for mcdonald's to be banned the press claimed that his very own dutchy originals range was even worse than mcdonald's but do people believe it so if you had a choice between a big mac and a dutchy originals organic pie which one do you think is the healthiest i think this one if i said to you you could have a big mac or a dutch european big macs never ever okay i'm far too healthy for that i would probably say the pie touch the originals yeah i'm confused and what to find out for myself what duchy food is really like i'm going to dutchy supersize me and for the next 10 days eat exclusively from prince charles organic range so let's get the sausages on the go a couple of rashes the bacon well chutney you'd like to do instead of tomato sauce oh that is so sweet so now i'm going to eat this for breakfast every day fresh tomato soup with rosemary organic parsley organic sugar what's sugar doing in soup sugar what's sugar doing in my cornish pasty fresh gravy obviously for people who don't cook [ __ ] gravy raw cane sugar caramelized sugar there's no sugar in my chicken and mushroom pie i can't eat it i can't face it i mean my body is a temple i can't stomach the thought of another nine days of duchy nosh so i'm handing the challenge over to two younger fitter identical twins to make things more interesting i'm putting lisa on the mcdonald's diet can i have a bacon egg and cheese bagel please well julie is chuffed that she gets to choose from the posh duchy range the twins will be attempting the diets for 10 days during which time they'll be closely monitored by a doctor now i ate opacity and then i discovered that there's more fat saturated fat in that pasty than there is in a big mac this does contribute around 90 percent of the guideline daily amount of saturated fat for an adult woman that's an incredibly large amount a duchy's cornish pasty contains as much saturated fat as four ginster's scotch egg bars or three rustlers microwave bbq ribs sandwiches or one and a quarter tesco's micro donna kebabs unlike me the twins managed to stick with their menus for 10 days what i want to know is how has the royal regime measured up to mcdonald's it was time to find out what effect it had had on their health well really the key thing is the cholesterol now it's the same sort of news for both of you the percentage of good cholesterol that you've got has absolutely dropped like a stone oh really so the ratio of good cholesterol to bad cholesterol is now in the range that would be potentially dangerous long-term in fact the cholesterol ratio of the twin on the duchy's diet had changed even more than her sisters if she continued eating her royal regime it could have had some unexpected side effects lost concentration loss of libido loss of to tell libido all we can say is that in this little experiment that we've done with you too it has had a profound effect on your cholesterol yeah right so i've [ __ ] up your sex life you can't remember anything you kept putting your phone in the fridge otherwise okay i see all of that in a nutshell really janet i do feel bad about it pretty shocking stuff but when i tried to talk to prince charles about it he passed it on to duchess who said duchy's originals are designed to be enjoyed as part of a balanced diet all our products use pure and natural ingredients with no artificial ingredients or flavors they clearly state the ingredients and nutritional content on the packets we are considering adding nutritional information on our website not good enough charlie i've decided to issue my very own f word asbo to prince charles for anti-social food behaviour prince charles this is what you've got to do stop adding sugar to your savory products stop making products with high levels of saturated fat and finally start giving your customers a full nutritional breakdown of all your products i took charles's asbo to his mansion on the mao but he didn't answer the door there you go charlie there's your ass bow hello what's that you've got there this is a special pie duchy pie how are you fine considering i had tweaked that stuff 10 days no i lasted one day and you know the reason why i lasted one day on the dutch original dart nothing to do with my loathing of the monarchy no nothing to do with the fact i couldn't give a toss whether i'd get a night or not unlike you honestly yes thank you i ate that food for one day and i felt unbelievably awful pretty sweet it's really sweet why is the pineapple why is that i got sugar in it i make a chicken pie i don't put sugar in it do you put a chili out pasty that

If you liked this clip check...",2022-12-03 22:16:02.927159, beef cheeks just think the size of your little cheeks yeah imagine the size of a cow with them and the cheek is right underneath here yeah i want you to give them a really nice season with salt and pepper on there please so beef cheeks very cheap i cut that takes sort of a long time to cook yeah but give it a bit of love let it cook in the oven it comes out like a dream a little touch of oil in the pan what you want to do is get them really nicely colored sid sid into the pan oh cool lay away you see what that is um [Music] sitting at the dock of the the beach baby and then i want the onion chunky because i'm gonna cook it for like three three and a half hours so you go down down down and then again there and there so it doesn't overcook so a really good color on the cheeks like that so how do you cook these at our restaurants if they take so long they go in the oven literally half past six seven o'clock in the morning three and a half four hours to be ready for lunch and the longer you leave them in their juices and the cooking liquor the better three nice cloves of garlic good onions in and garlic in please nice where's your baby there it is good get those onions and that garlic really nicely colored put the cheeks back in please right red wine in cool okay and the red wine is going to deglaze the pan so delays will basically sort of rinse all that flavor off the bottom of the pan yeah okay because that's going to make the most amazing sauce now you could use tomato puree but chopped canned tomatoes you'll make a much better sauce i'm going to top that with some stock so the secret braising is having little of the meat exposed and 90 of it submerged see them now yeah they're like little crocodile heads popping up out the water turn the gas off and leave the lid just off at the end there if we had to cover it completely the steam hits the top yeah the lid and all that water comes very badly solar still that's right in the oven 140 150 for about three and a half to four hours good job boom for pudding i'm making one of my absolute favorite italian desserts banacotta with that quintessentially italian flavoring espresso [Music] start by immersing two leaves of gelatine in cold water and leave to soak into a small saucepan add caster sugar cream milk sugar and a shot of good strong coffee [Music] gently bring to a simmer and remove from the hob [Music] squeeze out the soaked gelatine leaves and stir into the hot cream until completely dissolved pour your cream mixture into a jug and fill your moulds just short of the rim rinsing your molds in cold water before filling will make it easier to get your panna cotta out once it's set [Music] leave in the fridge for at least two to three hours or overnight [Music] to make your cinnamon hazelnut brittle pour caster sugar into a pan and cook over medium heat until the sugar melts to a deep golden brown scatter toasted hazelnuts into the caramel dust with ground cinnamon and leave to set at room temperature when your panna cotta is firm giving each mold a quick dip into boiling water should ensure a perfect stress-free exit onto the plate [Music] dress with a shard of crunchy hazelnut brittle nothing could be so deliciously elegant right captain jack quick run through panna cotta's are nearly set beef cheeks are nearly cooked we're going to now do the fig and crostini oh okay let's take the figs we're going to make a nice slightly spicy fig jam take all the tops yeah in half and each half into three sugar the touch of salt in there okay we're making a jam but we don't want to be too sweet and then these little babies what are they ah what's the shape stars star niche meat it's tarnished taken from the hennessy plant yeah when you dry them like that so intensifies the flavor really important to count how we put in there okay yeah so one two three four five so they're just there for a flavor and then you take them out that's right secret here let's get that camo going so when i hear of jam i don't think of caramel no but this is a very fast jam caramel's starting to color i want you very carefully to drop the figs in there good so the juice out of the figs is starting to break down the caramel you know what that is well sweet vinegar i love that on my salad you've got that sort of sweet and sour flavor leave that cooking for three four minutes now let's slice our chipotle in italian crostini means little bits of toast but it can be made out of leftover baguette sourdough or any crusty open textured bread we're staying authentically italian with ciabatta season them and then drizzle a little touch of olive oil on there both sides really important because we're going to grill the bread push it down put some lovely very lovely take it off with the chipata toasted we need to carefully extract the star in these pods from our piping hot fig jam my jacket we've got one little bugger to find oh no is it there yes it is right now we've got the green light to crush some of the skin's disintegrated in that camera that looks so nice while jack carefully spreads the crostini with our hot fig jam i can unveil the last element to our starter the creamy italian speciality burrata a little money bags they can delicious this looks fun doesn't it we need to season them lightly drizzle over a little olive oil and dust them with lemon zest can you imagine that sat there and you tear some of it off when you stick it on top of that back to the main course to match our hearty beef cheeks i've chosen to use papridelli rule number one when cooking pasta salt in first salting first good olive oil in pasta in twist it round so you don't break it no bring that back up the ball that's going to take about three for four minutes flat leaf parsley scrunch it up for me yup and chop him now wait to see these beef cheeks beauties at them oh look soft they're very soft tiny want to taste that's so good oh jack you just dribbled on your jumper joke really right drain the pasta salt pepper pasta little drizzle of olive oil i'm going to put your fresh pasta nicely chopped nicely chopped in this is the magic bit okay you take a little ladle of the juice put that at the bottom and you put the pasta on top of that sauce honestly oh my gosh your sisters are gonna love you even more now you know uh what about when you cook this with your girlfriend one day uh just tell her where you got the recipe from william promise promise i don't want you stealing daddy's thunder one beautiful jaw on there two beautiful jaws on there and then the third jaw and then you go over with the sauce how cool is that delicious you've got the porra i've got the cheeks let's go please [Music] my ultimate italian dinner quick thick jam crostini with creamy borata a main course of slow cooked beef cheek ragu with papadely and for pudding espresso panna cotta with cinnamon hazelnut brittle a stunning meal to bring the whole family together in the best italian tradition first things first i'd like you to season the stewing steak a nice spoon of flour mix yeah good girl what's the flour going to do dad the flour helps to brown the beef our seasoned flour will also help to add flavor and thicken the stew i feel a bit like marshmallows they do feel a little bit marshmallow don't they look at the size of the chunks of the beef i'm going to cut my carrots literally similar similar size that's right does that mean they'll cook equally that's right now these are little pearl onions i'm gonna put them in hole as well everything has to stay the same otherwise it could burn oh we've seen burn garlic before oh matilda she promised you weren't gonna mention that what is that time time and what they bay leaves bailey's good girl tablespoon of oil in the beef goes in first okay [Music] got a beautiful color remember the carrots thyme in could go garlic purl onions in good give that a really good mix up [Music] easy to make daddy stews are very easy to make providing at the beginning you give it a little bit of love now that's all beautifully browned that thing that is beer and that's going to deglaze the pan adding beer or stout helps to tenderize the beef and give it a hearty delicious flavor and that's the only way i want you to taste beer in a stew yeah i'm going to add in a couple of teaspoons of tomato puree please in fact three please because it's so nice and there's one final thing in there cover this chewing steak with the beef stock give that a little mix with daddy please wow that's really nice it's not even cooked yet do you keep all these vegetables in when you serve it oh yes is the garlic going to be burnt no excuse me right and we always put the lid with a little bit just a little bit so it can breathe that's right i cannot make the stew all watery into the oven at 150 please teals for about two and a half hours and now you can focus on your homework fun time to knock up two delicious hearty potato classics in one twice baked bubble and squeeze jacket potatoes start by baking large potatoes in a preheated oven at 180 degrees shred one third of your savoy cabbage and saute in butter and add a dash of water until tender [Music] after about half an hour your potatoes should be crisp on the outside and cook through in the middle slice them in half and scoop out the soft potato center then mash with a couple of knobs of butter mix in the cabbage and season to taste spoon this mixture back into your potato shells and into the oven for a further 10 minutes or until the tops are nice and crispy and golden two delicious hearty potato classics in one twice baked bubbling squeak jacket potatoes right homework done yeah beef stew is chewing stewing let's get on with our delicious hearty pet art i've been looking forward to this you and i chef i'm gonna prep the pears so if you peel i'll top and tail into quarters pears go soft in the oven very very quickly so we're gonna put them on a tart you'll need to leave them whole half or in quarter what's that in there ginger that's right a stem ginger so you stem ginger and fresh ginger next add your stem ginger a little of the stem ginger syrup good girl and some brown sugar to your quartered pears then just grab some fresh ginger off you go so it's a bit of a um different one to grate this because it doesn't really come through like the cheese no i'm gonna make that a little bit zesty now we've got some lemons some lemon zest in there right what we need to do now is give that a nice little mix now this is a sweet pastry you can buy this stuff where you make it it's so easy to do so give me your finger that's my center point i want you to get the pears going around like that a really nice circle it's difficult isn't it because the pears keep on sliding all over the place yeah so egg wash the outside and i'm going to show you a little trick so you lift that up so see egg wash acting like a bit of a glue that's right crimple this with our finger and the pastry forms this nice little shelf like a little money bag are you going to do anything with the spare pairs oh yeah you start building that up then you see the fresh ginger and those nice little bits of stem ginger let me go around mike with your glue we might glue just on top tilly's last job is to give our tart a good dusting of icing sugar so that caramelises it and colors the pears beautifully it's a bit like snow isn't it now that glazes the pastry so the pastry has this really nice shine on there as well finally the lemon on top and then put that there 180 and in she goes you smell the beef smells delish wow it's even gone down a bit more hasn't it look at that i want you to just i was hoping you'd

If you liked this clip check...",2022-12-03 22:16:02.927159, [Music] some of the best food i had in india was street food and every little food stall was cooking up something spicy something delicious a little teaspoon of oil gonna toast off a teaspoon of cumin mustard seeds a touch of salt and pepper lightly fry them off it's really important to cook off the spices it intensifies the flavor but really draws out that nice spicy deep rich flavor so onion three fingers one in front two behind nice and fine onions in now we're going to caramelize those onions mustard seeds have started to infuse cumin has that nice kick now with a little touch of butter in there get it nice and sort of rich gas up nice and high and really caramelised onions now once the onions have turned a rich golden color that's what i'm looking for that is beautiful add baby spinach keep that pan nice and hot if you don't cook it out the actual breakfast ends up watering when the spinach is cooked set aside and it's onto the spicy eggs now the breakfast really starts to come alight four nice eggs now give those eggs a little whisk a little touch of butter into the pan a little teaspoon of oil so the butter doesn't burn when the butter and oil are hot add a teaspoon of garam masala and turmeric cook that out now take your eggs into the pan almost gonna make like a really nice spicy scrambled egg turn the gas down now as the scrambled egg comes together just finish that with a little bit of butter i quite like the sort of creaminess makes it so much more delicious and then from there you get my spinach chop up and then fold in the spinach to your scrambled egg something quite exciting about eating spice for breakfast but it's served in these wonderful little thin naan breads this will work with any flatbread or wrap you fancy and then lightly toast your naan take the eggs off the heat whilst you get on with the last job add quick mint and spice yogurt dressing couple of tablespoons of fresh yogurt in there's always something to take out the heat then add chopped mint salt and turmeric mix that in now take a scrambled egg and half fill banana it smells incredible get your yogurt down on top and lift that over and for me that's what really stands out with street food in india how delicious they can make street food with a little bit of spice amazing [Music] once you try this spicy wrap i promise you scrambled eggs will never taste the same the secret to a really good madeline is it's light fluffy delicious and it's perfect with the coffee in the morning so melt the butter gently next crack three eggs that was one of the most exciting things about living in paris there was always something there in that little pastry shop that used to live above gotta incorporate the sugar and then give that a really good whisk because it's important to incorporate some air now the secret to whisking is a big beautiful balloon whisk the bigger the balloon whisk the more aeration you'll get in the mixture so best thing to do is just go from left to right and then change hands every 15 or 20 seconds so your hands never get tired and tilt the ball to your advantage as well now you can see the mixture starting to air it's almost double in size the more you whisk this the lighter it becomes so it starts to almost look like a light whipped cream gone is that dark rich egg yolk color beautiful once the eggs and sugar become pale creamy and thick sift in the self-raising flour sieve in the flour now i'm giving my madeline's a twist by adding poppy seeds for a crunch and lemon for flavor the zest of lemon in there generous on the lemon lime is wonderful orange zest again beautiful i've even made pink grapefruit madeline's with poppy seeds delicious but lemon for me is the best pour the melted butter down the side of the bowl so it cools down even more and then combine start mixing that in it's really important at this stage that we don't beat the mixture i want to keep that nice aerated texture across the madeleine mix so i'm going to use a spatula now and just gently mix my butter in now give that a good mix and they say that the longer you make them mix up in advance the higher they raise in the oven look at that it looks beautiful leave that to sit there [Music] and we'll butter and line our moulds you can make these in little miniature yorkshire pudding molds i've even seen madeline's been cooked in espresso cups so if you haven't got the traditional madeline tray yorkshire pudding trays are just as good lightly butter the inside of the tray take a tablespoon of flour and the secret now is to lie in the mould with a flour that stops any chance of the madeline sticking tap the sieve into all the little grooves and this will ensure that they'll come out instantly then all you do then is just stand up the tray and tap it two or three times and you'll see the flower roll out so there you go the baking sheet lined beautifully no excess butter and no excess flour the beauty of this recipe is that you can make it the night before and then simply bake it in the morning when you're ready to go put the mixture into a jug to make it really easy to pour into the tin give it a little stir so you've got that nice even distribution of those poppy seeds and just gently lovely film up to the top oh beautiful so much easier pouring this from a jug because you get the exact amount in in the oven 180 degrees do not open that door before 10 minutes and wait for that wonderful surprise [Music] they smell amazing now a little tap on the side of the tray and this would just all pop out beautifully that smell is unique that nice soft crisp outside with this lovely fragrant fluffy center and the secret of a great madeline as the french would swear by it is this lovely little mound on top they call it the nipple but that is the confirmation that is perfect my poppy and lemon madeleines are a sophisticated continental start to the day and take me straight back to paris the secret of a good chip butty is in the potato now these are desiree potatoes one of my first ever jobs was working in a chip shop i used to put sacks and sacks of potatoes into the rumbler which will send the potato peeler all day long today i'm gonna do something a bit healthier for my oven chips with a twist simply peel slice and blanch for three to four minutes drain season and cover well with propeca spread evenly over an oiled baking tray and place into a preheated oven for 20 minutes simple as that next up easy fish fingers this is pollock a really nice firm delicious fish got the fish in finger size batons of fish put them onto your plate and just lightly salt them you can do that literally 20 minutes 30 minutes before you start cooking the fish it firms the fish up beautifully and it allows it to become a little bit more durable especially in the pan now for the coating start by thoroughly coating the fish in seasoned flour and then just roll it to get rid of those little sharp corners because then it stops those corners almost burning in the pan in to your egg wash and really coat them wonderful and then this is dill goes brilliantly well with a fish and run the dill through my breadcrumbs that makes it more aromatic lay them onto your breadcrumbs nothing wrong with the chip butty nothing wrong with fish fingers just give it a lovely modern twist beautiful once the fish fingers are thoroughly coated they're ready to pan fry and they'll need around three minutes on each side i want the fish fingers to be nice and crispy get a really nice color on them first and then we'll flip them over and finish them with butter bring the heat up into the pan nice little knob of butter that'll work wonders with the breadcrumbs and the dill nice and carefully take them out they look and smell incredible stay nice and crispy now to assemble my chip butty starting with buttered thick crusty bread a slice of bread mop up that amazing flavor on slice in half never slice in an angle my mouth is salivating beautiful on with the ship butty there's one thing missing and it signifies that i've never forgotten the joy i've come for food but my god that makes me feel like a nine year old excuse me for a moment when you want to stuff my face [Applause] [Music] homemade fish fingers and my ultimate chip buddy so simple to make but trust me it tastes amazing

spanking fresh shellfish never fails to make an impression and when you want the best crustaceans it pays to ask an expert 19 pound it's a bargain at 20 pounds fishmonger roger barton really knows his shellfish inside out hello he said can he go back home so i'm sorry brother you're with me he's been in the fish game at london's billings gate market for over 35 years glean some of his knowledge and you'll never be at a loss when it comes to shopping for shellfish right what we've got here are corvettes some people known as prawns and these are a picture they've got to be lovely and shiny you'll find if they're too limp the head starts coming away from the body not a good sign looks a bit like me worse for the whale chop your old garlic up get the old wok lovely bit of olive oil lovely lovely jubbly lovely lovely jubilee in they go absolutely fantastic and if you like prawns as much as me then you'll love all these different kinds here are my favorites brown shrimps might be tiny but punch well above their weight in terms of taste i love them potted in spice butter and spread on toast atlantic prawns are great value and packed with flavor fantastic as tapas or in curries small tiger prawns are also good value and great for asian salads stir fries and fish stews whereas these massive ones are so spectacular i just keep them simple marinated in garlic oil and chili char grilled and served in their shells and longustings are one of my favorites you can buy the succulent beauties whole just roast or boil and serve with garlic mayonnaise [Music] people used to eat winkles goggles they're not doing it anymore it's such a shame they should be more daring all due respect you wouldn't make love the same way for the rest of your fat life wrinkles there they are lovely they smell of the seed a little bit of pepper and salt and a dash of vinegar then that does enhance the flavor in this country we have got the finest oysters in the world i die for these the only thing you have to look for with an oyster that is tightly closed if it's open avoid be adventurous come on try it nothing ventured nothing going get the right recipe and the freshest shellfish and you'll guarantee success in the kitchen whether it's in one of my restaurants or back at home i know that as well as delicious food one of the fundamentals to making guests happy is creating a great atmosphere vietnamese style fresh prawn rolls one of the keys to cooking for crowds is creating the atmosphere and that buzz getting your guests to sort of almost get involved and dip in and dip out this is an exciting fragrant wrap that is so easy to do first off soak the noodles these are thin glass noodles basically bring the kettle up to the boil and just pour just let them steep there for a couple of minutes the noodles are for my prawn rolls as they soak i'm gonna make a spicy dipping sauce to go with them start off with sugar we're trying to create that sweet sour salty but a really nice sort of heated sauce as well rice wine vinegar that will dissolve the sugar fish sauce now that's going to give it saltiness next the chili i want the seeds left in because i want some power chilli in a little bit of garlic don't need to chop it too finely just slice it take a spring onion just top and tail them slice the slices bring it in nice and thinly so it sort of almost permeates that dipping sauce i grew up with the love of spring rolls but on the back of my visit to vietnam it sort of transformed my respect for a spring roll give that a little mix a little bit of coriander and fresh mint roll them up and chop herbs in there's no olive oil in there there's no cream there's no butter it's just a really nice light dipping sauce and wow all those senses going on now we're gonna make the filling for the wraps a really nice fresh noodle salad rinse the noodles in cold water then chop them into bite-sized lengths prawns peeled and cooked slice them up the prawns give a really nice sweetness next the vegetables i want crunch freshness texture baby gem lettuce and just shred that lettuce next spring onion the good news about these wraps is that you can make them up in advance sit them in the fridge and then take them out literally seconds before you guess arrive peel the carrot so you got really nice fresh crunchy carrot now fresh mint fresh basil and fresh coriander together it sounds a little bit bizarre but it tastes amazing don't hold back with the herbs they'll really help make the filling vibrant fresh and aromatic finally touch a lime just squeeze that fresh lime juice over there a couple of tablespoons of your dipping sauce don't put too much in there it just makes all the filling too wet just give that a really good mix that's a very quick simple salad to eat now but let's get it into a wrap now take your rice paper wrap literally 30 seconds in warm water you can get rice paper wraps from your local asian supermarket or buy them online gently lift it out the water there beautiful lay it carefully onto your board [Music] place the mixture at the bottom don't overfill it because it'll be a nightmare to roll fold them over first nice and tightly halfway then tuck in the ends make sure nothing's coming out the sides beautiful it's so light fragrant incredibly simple to do and there you go a very delicious fragrant asian wrap certainly different to the chinese spring rolls i grew up with to prep it get the head and twist keep hold of those heads make the most amazing stock and then with your thumb get underneath the shell and just peel off that beautiful little layer now with your thumb on your finger push and shake and look the whole tail comes off you don't have to peel the whole thing from there get your knife and just gently cut the surface of the prawn and what we're looking for there is that little dirt sack that's got to come out otherwise if you cook the prawn with that sack in there it's crunchy it's not very nice and it ruins that sweet flavor and there you go the most amazing prawn ready for cooking

...",2022-12-03 22:16:02.927159, my shopping mantra is simple first rely on your senses make sure whatever you're buying it looks smells and really feels good and if you get the chance taste it before you buy it second is to recognize that knowledge is crucial the more you know about where your ingredients come from and how they produce the better so ask lots of questions and learn you're never too old to learn from experts and when it comes to buying great birds one person knows what to look for is award-winning fifth generation master butcher danny lid gain poultry is a great meat because there's many different types of birds it's worth tasting the variation of flavours between different first to birds is massive turkey's a great lean meat that's available all year round not just for christmas anybody who's worried about eating fatty meats it's a really healthy flavoursome meal game birds people don't try them often enough once they're shot they're hung up for a little while but a few days at least it means the meat's going to be more tender it all adds flavor to the birds we've got a wood pigeon and a red leg partridge both really good and cook really quickly when you're buying a chicken some of the things to look out for is obviously the smell and when you're smelling a good quality chicken you can tell the difference the skin's a nice white color and it smells like a fresh chickeny smell when you're buying from a good butcher you'll find you tend to get the giblets as well which is basically the neck and other organs this is great for making gravy once you have cooked it you can use all the offcuts for other things stir fries curries pasta dishes save the bones use the bones for stocks and soups they're really packed full of flavor and remember there are lots of different breeds of chicken all have different characteristics and flavors so shop around and find the ones you love here are three of my all-time favorites the label anglais these come from an old british breed they've got smaller breasts but the meat's delicious the black leg a fantastic french variety succulent with bags of flavour and really meaty thighs and the pulley divorce this is the rolls royce of chickens rich gamey and delicious one for special occasions i think people should maybe try and buy less meat but aim for the best quality you're only going to get out what you put in by putting the best quality into a dish you're going to get the best results my next recipe is an old classic roast chicken but with a simple twist it takes on a new life and is guaranteed to impress one of the things i love about cooking and that keeps me excited after 25 years behind the stove is that there's always something new to learn every day new ingredients new techniques and new cuisines start off with the stuffing it's amazing how exciting a stuffed roast chicken can be because it keeps the chicken incredibly moist and gives a delicious texture inside the bird i'm going to start off with cured ceriso this is a traditional spanish sausage and it's garlicky spicy incredibly meaty that gives a little bit of sort of richness to the stuffing get our chorizo in start cooking that down and getting all those oils out a little touch of olive oil in there to get it going right onions chopped add the onions to the cerezo and in a matter of seconds they'll change color as they soak up all the flavor that lovely spiciness has been stolen from that sausage now the onions smell incredible garlic garlicky fresh thyme just hold it down and put your fingers on there and it's a really nice way of taking off all those nice fragrant little time flowers you can hear it crackling in the background these are cannellini beans they're waxy very soft and so delicious but very dense but for stuffing they're so robust nothing breaks down drain them off in they're going to take on all that juice as well from the freezer i'm going to season them now because they're very dense so it needs some help i mean that looks like it's a dish on its own good enough to eat now i want to sweeten things up a little bit tomatoes half dried in that sweetens up the stuffing beautiful the stuffing's ready look at the color everything looks spanish it looks delicious now stuffing the chicken i like taking off these little knuckles as the chicken cooks the skin stretches over the bone you can get a really nice drum and take off those little wingtips as well salt pepper so important now you're stuffing i'm gonna go right inside the chicken push it down this really helps to cook the bird evenly because you're pushing out all the empty spaces in the carcass and take a nice large lemon push the lemon in pick up the person's nose pull the skin over olive oil on top salt and pepper a teaspoon of paprika sprinkle it on and then get your hands and sort of rub that in and see what the paprika is doing to the chicken putting this like sweet spicy marinade it's not even roasted yet but it looks delicious [Music] 400ml of white wine same quantity of water that helps the chicken to steam chicken in be generous with the time sprigs [Music] make sure the fall is folded tightly around the roasting tray so the chicken steams in the oven keeping it moist and juicy into the oven [Music] cook for one hour at 180 degrees with a foil on nice take it out and remove the full lid then give it another 30 minutes to crisp up that skin look at that it's so important to make sure you take that tinfoil off with half an hour to go beautiful pierce that open squeeze it in that delicious gravy mix that into the tray and sieve that that's really nice fragrant lemony spiced roasting juices to finish before we cut up the chicken take out that amazing stuffing [Music] incredible i'd have that with chicken over potatoes any day and then just get your chicken roasting juices now to cut the chicken up hold the drum and slice straight through and there's a wonderful drum and a thigh through the wishbone off slice with the point at an angle so you can see the texture of that amazing roast chicken just take my cooking juices just want to give a nice sort of lemony flavour over my chicken and there you go a delicious very charming stuffed roast chicken you

If you liked this clip...",2022-12-03 22:16:02.927159, when you think of a burger what you need is a great sauce and a light smoky barbecue goes hand in glove with a great burger start by finely chopping one onion and three cloves of garlic nice hot pan tablespoon of olive oil onions and garlic into the pan nice seasoning salt and pepper now the secret of a good barbecue sauce is that really important caramelization to begin with a nice tablespoon of brown sugar it darkens the onions but it really starts to sort of give that nice syrupy body to the sauce and put a little bit of heat in there now a nice teaspoon of smoked paprika that's the important part of working with spices you've got to cook them out and almost sort of burn off that rawness especially with a smoked paprika that's exactly where i want it to go onions and garlic beautifully caramelized cider vinegar in reduce that down now i've got a fantastic smoky base to complete the sauce i'm making my life really easy and adding pre-made worcester sauce and tomato ketchup cook that out for two to three minutes now depending on how thick you like the barbecue sauce that determines how long you cook it out for i don't want it to be too runny but i don't want it too thick either that's the consistency we're looking for lovely turn down the gas charger seasoning now take that out it's the kind of sauce that i like to have sort of bottled up in the fridge it's great for sandwiches but goes brilliantly well with these sliders homemade smoky barbecue sauce [Music] give the pan a little wipe now start the mix for the sliders to give my mix a really interesting flavor and texture i'm gonna be using unsmoked back bacon i travel all over the world and i spend a lot of time in the states they know how to make a great slider pork sliders beef sliders chicken sliders and it's almost like a way of having a burger but on a much smaller miniature level a little teaspoon of olive oil i want that bacon to get really nice and crispy bacon in this just gives the really nice sort of chunky delicious mix i want texture and pork is perfect for slider [Music] and choppy shallot [Music] shallots are a lot sweeter than your normal white onion fine fine fine and in [Music] now that bacon's getting really nice and crispy i want a bit of heat in there a little teaspoon of smoked paprika in there when you see these sliders in the states for one portion there's like four or five of them little mini one biters incredible now take your pork just open up and give that a really nice seasoning so important you can't season a slider after you've cooked it it's impossible so season it nicely bake it now that's nice and crispy just take a little touch kitchen roll and just drain that off there nice pat that nice and dry i want all that nice sort of crispiness in there beautiful mix all that in take a nice ball and sort of roll it the size of a golf ball get it nice and round first and then three fingers just pat that down don't flatten them too thin otherwise they overcook and they go sort of dry because sliders are bite-sized burgers designed to go in small buns you don't want to make them too big good get the pan nice and hot tablespoon of olive oil when a slider is literally that thick about an inch thick we're going gonna take two and a half to three minutes to each side in turn them over lovely once you've turned them tilt the pan and just spoon all that juice back into them keep my mouth watering now very easy to dry the pork out so just feeling it now your fingers is nice and firm it's a little touch of springiness in the center i'm happy with those add your cheese now so it gets nicely melted i'm using wedgies or smoked cheddar and it has that nice sort of soury smoky creaminess to the slider finally shredded baby gem lettuce just take those buns make sure they're sliced nice and evenly take your lettuce be quite generous with the lettuce just a nice thin slice of tomato take your burgers you see that cheese you feed melted your bbq sauce place the top on and that is my version the slider that is small dynamic but packed full of flavour i'll take that over a hamburger any day [Music] first off get that pan really nice and hot these are sirloin steaks sear it in the pan with all that fat on i'll add flavor salt and pepper couple tablespoons of olive oil in pan nice and hot hold up the steak and lay it in always lay away give the pan a little shake and it stops the steak from sticking we're looking for color and if it sticks it's gonna burn [Music] while the steaks are cooking i can get on with my super quick marinade now two tablespoons of misood paste that's a fermented soybean that gives a really nice sort of rich sweetness tablespoon of sugar a couple of tablespoons rice wine that gives it a really nice vinegary kick a couple of tablespoons of olive oil salt and pepper i'm looking for a nice sort of thick rich marinade marinade done it's time to turn the steaks sort the pan and to give the steak a little base all we're doing every time is just adding more and more flavor take your tongs and sort of lift the steak on its back and really melt all that fat down offer the gas take them out just take your knife it's all that fat there just slice that off i don't want any of that now in to the marinade [Music] beautiful tacos are one of mexico's most popular street foods they've been made from beef pork chicken or fish and are loaded up with amazing sauces and spices now i want something sort of pickly cabbage these are um chinese cabbages slice it in half and look at it really crisp and really tasty we're gonna slice that into quarters and then just shred it and take your time you think of cabbage hair and you think of sort of braised overcooked cabbage nothing worse but at a taco you want freshness a little season chili flakes they sort of discreetly give it a little bit of heat a little touch of rice wine vinegar if you haven't got that fresh lemon juice a small drop of toasted sesame seed oil give that a really good mix now i need something to sort of bring it together we take some wasabi paste very hot very spicy a sort of thumbnail size i'm gonna mix and that couple of tablespoons of mayonnaise and give that a really good mix these are basic corn tortilla the trick is to sort of color them and then shape them actually place it on the gas ring use some tongs so it's not to burn yourself you can also toast your tacos in a frying pan from there i'm just gonna place it on the rolling pin literally 30 seconds as it cools down the great thing about serving tacos is people can fill them themselves just the way they want them cabbage just squeeze out wet marinade a nice rustic little mountain mayonnaise on wait you see how soft and delicious and almost sort of melting in the mouth texture we've got on this amazing sirloin it's look at that really nice sear around the outside it's just nice and pink in the middle start off with my crispy shell back of the spoon with the wasabi mayonnaise inside taco and just sprinkle that delicious pickled cabbage and then just start lining my taco three or four slices touch more on my spicy layer and that is how i'd make the perfect attacker [Music] just open up and drain the tuna into a sieve just lightly flake that don't press it too hard otherwise you'll dry out the tuna now these are water chestnuts just slice them nice and thin you can buy them anywhere any supermarket chestnuts and fresh ginger get rid of that rough skin on the outside by grating the ginger you get to get all that really nice sort of juice in take your spring onions and just slice on an angle i like the texture of the water chestnut with a spring onion or touch of fresh coriander lovely next remove the seeds from a chili to reduce its heat without losing any flavor and finely chop chilies in kaffir lime leaves roll them up nice and tight run your knife down the center once and just chop and that makes the fish cake nice and fragrant touch of salt a touch of pepper fish sauce just lightly season the tuna to bind all those wonderful ingredients two whole eggs and give that a nice little whisk and then add your eggs get your hands in there and start mixing get the mixture roll it and hand the hand into the palm pat them down nicely to cook add a little ground oil to a hot pan at the face of a clock i'm going to go from 12 all the way around first one in these fish cakes only take a few minutes to cook so keeping track of the order they go in the pan means you know which one to turn first [Music] to the pad a nice gentle little shake make sure that nothing's sticking to the bottom spatula two fingers on top turn them over beautiful that crackling noise is something you always want because the tune's already cooked so we're just lightly frying them we get a nice crisp outside and gently take them out smell incredible let them sit there we're gonna make a really nice delicious simple dipping sauce start off a little pinch of sugar fish sauce two tablespoons that gives it the saltiness one tablespoon of rice wine vinegar and some fresh lime juice squeeze all

james good to see you and you're mike and this is steven steve thanks for showing richard richard how are you welcome the most important thing about the food tonight is straightforward and easy but the real key is cooking for 50 diners right yes if they're not happy with the food they've got the right not to pay for it that makes you look stupid that's my reputation going down the [ __ ] pan that's not gonna happen you know i don't care quite frankly whether you hate my guts but between now and 11 o'clock i just want it right nothing more than that yeah let's go the starter tonight right it's a very simple seared crusted tuna with a watercress salad okay guys here we go richard james and steve now you're working the city yes yeah you'll handle pressure yeah yeah now it's time to [ __ ] prove it yes first order four covers away table four four seeded tuna four sea bass four apple donuts yes chef thank you the brigade have been shown how to make the starter but to ensure they know what they're doing i'm going to run through it one more time yeah it goes in the soy sauce first yeah that starts to season it yes then from there we get our wasabi we brush it on all over then get your seeds and sprinkle your seeds over there we've got a sesame seed crusted line of tuna pans really nice so it'll sear it and not boil it okay you focus on the tuna yeah nothing more turn that round see the color of the seeds oh you're nice toasted color so watch not too thin my slice is down look at that if all that tuna goes out like that yeah i can guarantee we'll have 50 customers i'll be paying for that now let me ask you a question all of you yeah now you may be from essex and [ __ ] tight and too interested in [ __ ] drinking however would you pay for that yes yes yeah i would [Music] listen to it that's searing the tuna in yes what's the matter the olive oil bottle is lifted off melted oh [ __ ] hell um everywhere on that stove is [ __ ] piping hot yeah if we do it again the whole [ __ ] place is gonna go up in fire okay you guys work under pressure each and every day get organized yes golden ripping it's [ __ ] it's because it's cooked to [ __ ] that's why in the bin i need two seconds two seconds what do you need more olive oil more olive oil come on stop stop stop it's burnt my man if you just follow me yeah and you ask me questions i'm there with every step of the way that you're going through okay but you know quite frankly that's nearly 20 quid worth of tuna in the [ __ ] bin yes so start again sell it away please yes because that's gonna be like a [ __ ] limp dick let's clear down we'll do the whole [ __ ] thing again yes [Music] my name's richard and i'm a greedy bastard therefore i love the cook i'm half italian so i tend to cook a lot of italian food my name's steven i enjoy cooking thai japanese classic english dishes with like a little twist you know maybe a bit of horseradish in the match just to flare up a bit you know my name's james i can't see the stress of the kitchen being any worse than what we're already used to i get called a prick all day long so golden ramsay called me a freak i really kind of affect me in a pressurized environment isn't anything new to any one of us it's got to be done it's got to be done there and then and if you make a [ __ ] up it can be costly as long as government sermon says you boys have done a good job i'm proud of you that's going to make me happy i think we pull it off we're fematic so clearly we're better than everyone else so um yeah it won't be a problem all we've got now is four portions each to do that's all watercress leaves bean shoots in there yeah some coriander yeah spring onions in there yeah a little bit of dressing yes add a touch of ginger honey and sesame oil dressing and place it on a bit of thinly sliced radish because it's so thick yeah what we'll do is put two nice slices on there now are you happy with those yes yeah because i am they look fantastic

crispness so i'm very impressed okay good here guys here comes jb with the results obviously slow how many customers are going to pay for their staff very good news everyone everyone everyone is picking yeah that's [ __ ] good news yeah what's not good news for me on a personal front without the customers known is what went in the bin that's nothing to be proud of however well done now that doesn't mean to say we've got to start pissing our pants and [ __ ] up the sea bass because 50 customers can refuse to pay for the pass yeah it's a good start but do we get [ __ ] harder let's go next on the menu a delicious sea bass with soy sauce it's easy to cook but will it be too much for the brigade jax at least come back and send the [ __ ] thing yeah because right now this whole [ __ ] thing's on my shoulders it's time to get to grips with my pigs and i'll get some expert help to judge slepty chef's recipes right ainsley get your big [ __ ] chops in there welcome back to the f word tonight the brigade are getting a taste of what it's like to be a real chef and believe me it's not about pouncing around launching [ __ ] cat food or washing up liquid marco pierre white my ex-mentor is actually judging the daily mail dog food competition how [ __ ] sad is that they're asking readers to send in their favorite recipes for homemade dog food it's official celebrity chefs have clearly gone to the [ __ ] dogs pathetic so i'm looking for dogs ranging from short fat dumpy little sort of grunters i can't resist i'm entering a recipe into the daily mail competition i just can't decide whether it should be one of gary's ainslie's anthony's or marcos so i'm going to get the four dogs to make the decision for me and i want the dogs to look like the chefs just looking at his eyes that is definitely ainsley hey well he's definitely docile is he stupid i said hit rock bottom mike's mentor guy called marco poy is now sort of a chairman of sort of what about anthony well he's certainly [ __ ] ugly at enough foreign spiky hair slightly grey bit of a six-pack going on that's definitely gary thank you now where's the kitchen this way downstairs each dog is going to dine on one dish taken from their celebrity chef's cookbook and i've wrote in some of the staff from bassy dog's home to do the cooking [Music] pork chops with apple tart topping i'm not too sure the dog's gonna make that one you know what is that in there cheesy chicken breast well it looks like vomit we are in a dog's home [Music] the first time i've actually seen one of uh wazza's recipes actually put together let's hope the [ __ ] book didn't sell that well so uh pork chop chester chow mein tuna with bath with vinegar the [ __ ] what is that boat thing cheesy chicken greta and crunch crunch yes judgment time which chess recipe will i enter into the daily mail pet food competition the winner will be the meal wolf down in the fastest time now gentlemen please enjoy your dog's dinner yes be careful when you eat it don't slobber yes anthony apart from being the [ __ ] ugliest try somehow to keep the food on the plate okay let's cut all that [ __ ] french crap out marco pierre white mark peter white from now on we're in south [ __ ] london so we keep it real this is the comfy of tuna with a pepperoni and a balsamic vinegar dressing happy with the croissant nice and pink right ainsley off we go [Music] come on get your big [ __ ] chops in there right gaza let's go free pork chop with the apple pie topping and off we go excuse me hello hey hey anthony sit nice please and just try to look happy for once cheesy chicken gratin crunch what the [ __ ] are you thinking about when you came with that idea as time ticks by all the dogs are tucking into their grub well all except one who's turning his nose up at the posh nosh please eat some salad or something anthony come on i'll leave you in peace eat your dinner anthony pork chop isn't exactly been wolfed down marco can't keep his food on his plate but ainsley's chow mein on the other hand is going down a storm and it's hard to believe but waz's chicken brick has been rejected outright ready steady munch eat ainsley you have the best and the fastest dog's dinner in town at one minute 35 and well anthony i always knew it not even a [ __ ] dog would eat your food cooked chicken shredded 175 grams egg noodles 100 grams of bean sprouts yes amazing it's official the dogs gave your recipe the pours up so i'm sending it to the daily mail dog food competition let's see what marble white thinks about it [ __ ] good luck i think it's time to do something to show these celebrity chefs enough is enough so i've decided to set up a celebrity cookbook amnesty send me all the celebrity cookbooks that you think are crap and i'll dispose of them next of course i want faster yes and better imagine 50 customers paying for the [ __ ] sea bass as well as 50 customers paying for the starter with two thirds of the way there if that happens right big watch me you've really got to watch me now yeah [Music] center of the plate again stay nice and tidy yes so easy time for the main course a delicious sea bass in sorrel sauce [Music] sea vess for me absolute delicacy the flavor not just of the flesh but the skin is extraordinary fill it come down the backbone nice long strokes every time i fill it a sea bass it's a certified pleasure because they're extraordinary fish look at it absolutely beautiful three nice portions score and skin and the beauty of this fish is that it's so robust but so delicate in flavor sauce lava butter shallots salt pepper spread down the shallots with no colour that's absolutely crucial verma sea bass is very sweet and rich so therefore we need a really nice dry white wine to find that balance reduce fish stock in reduce cream in bring it back up to a boil sieve sorrel the flavor it gives to the fish sauce is extraordinary it's peppery a little bit like rocket it also has this really nice acidic tanginess to it into the cream just to infuse lovely hot pan olive oil season the bass salt pepper just before the olive oil starts to smoke sea bass in skin side down [Applause] turn it over i just faced over the bass keeps our skin really nice and crispy broccoli cooking for about two and a half minutes maximum drain still got a really nice dark green color see that's out they can hear that skin cracking away the song has done this magic the crispy skin the sea bass the real earthy flavor of the broccoli and then this wonderful peppery vinegary sauce the perfect way starting summer delicious sea bass with sorrel sauce done don't burn the [ __ ] bats okay nice two minutes till it starts to brown yeah nicely colored yeah just touch your seat back on there for me yeah it's two cooks yeah don't laugh at me i'm not laughing now no no no no no the bass is way overcooked it's going to take three and a half four minutes to cook maximum yeah yeah start again yes yeah don't flip that fish until there's a really nice golden brown bin service please back in your pocket [ __ ] it out what's going on guys [ __ ] you now are you not here just to spectate and [ __ ] go back and tell your mates what a hard one you had let's go yeah you got to get in there you know that nothing [ __ ] difficult let's go i cannot burp my hands of [ __ ] right steve just for your info it's the third time this table it's your first table right we've only sent two tables both your sea basses have been cooked to [ __ ] he's looking all right yeah you stopped calling me [ __ ]

about it yeah yeah do you care i don't care well [ __ ] you show me something then yes thank you chef thank you chef mate was my first time ever having sea bass so i was impressed i liked it i'm really not a fish eater so for me to say that it's really you know it was tender it was moist it also been cooked slowly for the flesh but the skin had been panning quite quickly [Music] they're all [ __ ] turned have we got any sea bass left because iron man right come around here yeah he's burnt three pants full now you've burnt it we started with 75 portions of bass we've got half the dining room not served yet we [ __ ] so many baths so early we've run out i'm going to it some more baths but when i fill up these bags when we get them can we [ __ ] cook them properly richard yeah chef yes hello quintus here listen to me on top of 75 just under 100 portions of bass hello don't [ __ ] it i know you're not a professional chef you know that but you are a [ __ ] bright spark and all i beg for for one hour is just a little bit of [ __ ] intelligence i'm sorry sorry chef did you enjoy your minecraft makos was good yes you sound french yeah i'm french it's not like raymond blanc banging on about how [ __ ] our british food is again did you enjoy your bath i enjoyed my bus but yeah where the sea bus was probably cool sorry i'm just nodding off two seconds did you enjoy your bath not as much as the sausage could you put your tongue out for me please got a [ __ ] ball bearing on the end of it would you expect me to take your pilot seriously when you've got all that shrapnel in there jump right twist please wait chef what do they say jb yeah far too long far too long that's the main campaign big big problem on this one steve that first table you cooked four times yeah what were the results how many customers out of 50 want to pay for their dinner uh 21 unknown thing 21 yeah why far too long to receive the main course and as well some of them find it exactly bland it's a line caught sea bass yeah roasted in olive oil it's the best quality [ __ ] sea bass 21 customers refusing to pay for the main course i don't know why you keep on laughing i think you find it a joke don't you let's get our priorities right yeah yeah [ __ ] the stupid [ __ ] laughing snickering hey because it's not you looking good right now yeah i'm good if you give me those vibes i'm gonna tell you you got those vibes whether you don't mean it inside i just wanted to come back this is important for me as it is for you yeah so when you're finishing on a high yeah okay are you ready yeah let's see clear down let's get ready for dessert yes next on the menu foodie gobshite janet street porter is back in my kitchen this is fish stew fish stew well whatever you [ __ ] want to call it golden and i'll find out what taxi drivers really think of me you want his cab [ __ ] off welcome back to the f word now genesee porter last year beat me in a challenge only because we had a [ __ ] panel of blind tasters that were so crap taste and distinction obsessed with low-fat food so i lost the challenge she's back for more and this time she's got [ __ ] no chance right the rules are simple the challenger picks their best dish and i have to try and beat that with my version the winner is the nets oh no sarah the winner for today is yes this time i'm determined to win um so don't tell me a low-fat soup this is fish stew well whatever you [ __ ] want to call it golden right the thing about making this yes is that you make the fish stock uh the day before which you get the fish manga to cut the fish into phillips and remove all the bones so you just got to get a carrier bag full of bones right it sounds a bit cheffy though you know that golden it's practical so you make the fish stop the day before by using uh onions you sweat onions celery maybe a bit of carrot lots of herbs thyme and so on in a massive pan the biggest pan you possibly can right and some white wine are you agreeing with this sauce in the background i'm listening but not getting very excited janet's making a fish too and i'm doing something sort of almost like a little classic bully base but a very quick bullier base because we haven't got time to do a long-winded three and a half four hour classic french bully bay so it's a very simple fish stew but then with red mullet fennel carrots shallots a touch of white wine but the secret ingredient today of course is the perno and that goes brilliantly with a fish just like the good old days we used to have the burner on black you got no idea the hard time i got after losing against the challenge you last time you know that what happened did you get your leg pulled down apart i mean no just in the kitchen they're saying [ __ ] you now chef you lost to janet street porter you're beaten by a woman who will not put up with fancy food things in piles unnecessary sauces do you know on the last challenge i actually let you win you know that gordon bollocks you tried your hardest oh my stop falling over janet you're right my dolly yeah i just had a slight disaster it's all right okay fish straight in and i mean really straight in guts have been taken out and straight in look at that then with the pans i'm gonna do now is just glaze the pan with a touch of purno and white wine what i'm gonna do so get all that flavor from the bottom of the pan is look wash out the pan in she goes and then in there again nice [Music] i don't know if you've got fish heads there or prawn heads can i have them i'm going to put them in my soup no i'm not giving them to you no you shellfish [ __ ] right that's [ __ ] out of order i'm sorry because you asked me for my head and i have not shot these vegetables as fine as i would have done because if i wasn't being finished filmed on [ __ ] national television i would have whacked them all in the blender and that's a bit of a top tip for all the [ __ ] at home yes we can't chop as small as you know supersonic golden i'm now putting my fish in okay good how do fish take the cook well i'm going to put in first the scallops because they're the thickest i unlike these recipes you know that this is such a simple recipe i think putting the saffron in is key because the saffron colors the potatoes they look fantastic yeah so i'm going to put my little bits of fish in a pan and unlike janet i'm gonna cook them separately okay because they cook very very quickly because they're small little bits of fish are you in favor of my cookbook msc what to make people send in useless cookbooks yeah unwanted cookbooks the sad thing is and you you've said a lot about this that people in britain buy cookery books but don't cook it's like porn they just go to bed every night instead of having a shag they read a cookery book they cook it i call it cookery pool they cook they cook they cook for my chocolate i hope it doesn't go on in your household so what do you have sex or do you read cookery books i would do both treat it like a dinner in between courses read right janet yes darling this is looking fantastic yeah start getting nervous please yes how are you doing i'm doing fine i can't i'm just doing a bit of sieving do you panic when things go pear-shaped at dinner parties in terms of when you're in dinner parties i worked too hard do you give dinner parties do i [ __ ] you can't charge them they come home can you i don't give them parties i call on a sparrow moment and say i'm cooking chicken pie want to come round i'm cooking fish jar week on saturday hold on not chicken pie with pastry janet surely well people the gays and calorie watchers don't eat the pastry gays don't eat pastry you're having a laugh aren't you i've got lots of friends that are going they love pastry why they're fat guys janet looks a nice color it tastes great does it be scared be scared be very scared you think i'm gonna lose yeah two challenges on the track you got another thing coming right six is almost ready gonna leave them both to simmer now between eight and ten minutes and then later on janet loses [Music] crispy doughnuts yeah so it's a nice yeast batter yeah now the most important thing with these yeah is just keep them submerged under the oil yeah out into the sugar so with a donut we're gonna serve a really nice slice of apple fritter yes yeah okay yeah in there like that off and in yeah okay right watch fresh yogurt yeah maple syrup and that's a really nice fine apple puree in there yeah look out with your fritter again out get it dry yeah and look i slice bingo finished yeah okay a word of warning these are deep fat fryers be [ __ ] careful be careful under no circumstances do we get this and start running around the [ __ ] kitchen with that stevie i'm [ __ ] serious don't laugh just for five minutes don't laugh yeah yeah let's go guys move up let's get desserts out here and let's get 50 [ __ ] desserts paid for i'm so determined to get everyone cooking sunday lunch even if that means taking on some of my least favorite people taxi come on you miserable [ __ ] oh come on taxi come on how are you can't get a cab i wonder why the london cab driver what was he done to upset you um i think they are perhaps now the most frustrating drivers on the planet they give you the the big one and the little one golden on your bike son no way mate golden you want this ken [ __ ] off a couple of years ago i upset these guys on telly and ever since that night they refused to pick me up so i'm here to make amends one's in trouble he can't cook to save his life i just hope he's in a good mood because normally they are miserable [ __ ] i've always relied on my wife for 10 years so that when i get in from work on one of them there'd be a nice dinner on the table i've never been able to take that in out to cook i've always ate the dinner i'm not worried about where it came from or whatever anything can cook it's a sandwich a hot cross farm or something you can cook like bacon and that and sausage but not like a proper big dinner i split up with my wife and then uh i've got the two kids and i'm forever getting them takeaways whenever i've got um they're not eating healthy food cool what a shit-off how old are the kids uh alfie's nine olivia is nearly seven uh-huh so born a girl yep and you've never cooked for them never you can't even do beans on toast well no i can do beans on toast i'm on about a nice lunch for them or something like that because whatever you do to those kids now it's a reflection of you isn't it exactly courses we've got hard work here ahead of us yeah yeah [Music] fascinating every time you get into a cab the meat is always off yes ah no wonder you guys are so rich you've got around a few quick summer it's gonna take a lot to get this lightly laid out the dark ages and comfortable in the kitchen looking for the dish that's got nine or ten uses start off with a shepherd's pie lovely but the most important thing about that is the mints are making a really nice savory mince lovely because on the back of that once it's been used for a shepherd's pie you can just evolve it spaghetti yeah then you've got um you know lasagna curried mince with some seasoning do you have two on the stove um i'll do it yeah i love guy this is what i might say exactly johnny i am known for all of this you're making me you're making me nervous turn the [ __ ] stove on i'll peel the onions yeah you peel the carrots let the knife do the work look just lift the knife up and just push the carrots down okay all the way through that's it nice and slow nice and slow oh nearly voila voila look at this so there's only chance i'm working with you in a restaurant yeah so far no no um the hot plate stands this high so we thought straight away we've never really seen a little head coming with the hot plate all right the garlic chop it nice and fine nice slices all in good man give it a good mix all right man fresh thyme take a little bit like that yeah and just have a little bit more try this yeah it's a herb but it's so so nice nice little spice to it right at the end like an adding but it's nice and mellow right now that's sweaty down add some tomato puree half a glass of red wine and lamb mints [ __ ] without putting it on the floor johnny now you got them on the [ __ ] suede gucci buckles oh [ __ ] you've got mints on your gold bars beef stock and worcester sauce then turn down the heat to simmer special time with the kids at the weekend yeah yeah this can be frozen and that's a way of sort of just getting organized yep oh [ __ ] the [ __ ] hell aren't there new tiles you guys just put down yeah so are they legit can we stand on them without food do we get done for standing on solid goods she's making me out of right dodgy character i thought all cabbies are dodging back into the pan and back onto the stove jolly please yeah we'll do and you know what as well go on slowly feeling more confident ready yeah nice little mash thank you into there you're almost like icing a cake yeah that's a nice bit of cheese on top now pop it in there plastic healthy olivia all right thanks man listen to me golden's here hi guys [ __ ] lori jerry at the bottom yeah getting them involved right now they've got these memories as they go up tell you what they are looking absolutely fantastic and they get to eat properly mango mango [Music] who needs takeaways when you got that beautiful yeah really one crucial question do you want dad to cook this again yes yeah what do you think mummy would think schmidt got smacked this is how sunderland should be well yeah but it's only you can make the effort you're the only person that can do this you know well they're an age where they're gonna remember everything thank you very much you've done it he's never had to cook in his life before now he's got no choice because he's got to look after his two kids and you know that sunday lunch there has to be 10 000 times better than a [ __ ] takeaway for your kids taxi stevie four porsche's away coming up let's go table 12 stevie hey brown very quickly be very careful get your spider in there and keep them dumped under the oil so they cook evenly turn this gas down find yourself yeah they are flipping them over oh come on i know there you go right listen listen you stop okay get rid of that [ __ ] burnt charcoal first yeah you take care of the apples yeah okay yeah what really scares me if we're gonna giggle and laugh and [ __ ] make this it's too dangerous guys yeah cause i'm gonna look a [ __ ] idiot if one of you scolded yourself with first-degree burns [ __ ] sake i'm not [ __ ] running out of everyone out of these we're [ __ ] by the way yeah serve two weeks from now on okay so if you don't run out guys yes a gap in the middle so good put them on there where's the sugar please for the doughnuts take two from here sugar please wash your hands put it down the shed too hard why'd you put them on the spider like that that's what [ __ ] them over oh bollocks man no i just i need to stop everybody grab some cold oil please put gem on then no i don't

i asked you to get serious it's just a [ __ ] bunch of giggles yeah and you know i know you're not professional chefs but i just want a little bit of [ __ ] hey safetyness now and that's why i'm standing here before some [ __ ] scolds themselves badly yeah okay finish what you're doing oh yeah no say hey i've asked for it about ten times yeah yeah so i don't wanna i don't i'll cook them you

recipe challenge you know what honey yes no it's very close to score three two two and it's the end of a very very long night i felt there's a big [ __ ] monkey on my back this evening because [ __ ] me was i doing a lot welcome back i can't wait to see janet street paula's face when she loses this challenge john baptist you'll taste that taste what a real fish soup should taste like not your finger janet [ __ ] know where that's been you just put your finger in my soup that's all right hurry up yeah and put madame porter out of her [ __ ] misery please yes okay let's go yeah hello guys how are you do you want to see really delicate flavors it's not the best fish it's got a lot of chili in it i like the spice okay where's that lazy frog okay it wasn't difficult yeah what was a very classic quick pull your bass what are they saying no no i just said it it's too [ __ ] hot janet it's forgotten i love you no yeah the preference it was delicious it was meaty full-bodied bit like me bit like your [ __ ] butlers give me kiss now get out oh yes [Music] right now time for some posh totty trini and susanna okay the pigs have been here a week now they take a lot of looking after but the kids are really rising to the challenge our duties who's gonna clean up the poo really okay there you go oh look jack come here look at his little ear look she's cut quite badly on the rear see the top of the rear what they're doing is they're catching the clip on the fence so when she's scratching her ears that clip on the back of her ear is pulling so it's bleeding kevin hi gordon so called in christine and kevin to get some advice the breeders who have bought the pigs from last week we brought you a little prezi for them thank you what is it it's a bit of a treat this hollow tree stump should satisfy the pig's natural desire for a good old scratch i want to talk to christian about their ears look because see the blood where they've been catching if we don't clean it up it's going to get infected so you've done a really good job in spotting that so we just clean it up with some cotton wool some warm salted water which will make them squeal but at least it will have the antiseptic effect and these little piggies squealed all the way home [Music] it may sound harsh but it really is in the pig's best interest they definitely won't bite no no no no pigs squeal i mean they squeal as if they're being murdered and they fight i mean they don't want to be turned upside down on their bottom so even though it's it's not actually that much of a discomfort for them uh they don't want to be there cool they don't like there is being clean do they i think we should give them a little treat now with an apple or something don't you corn jack feed them nicely one each the pigs certainly let you know when they're in any discomfort so i'm going to make sure these girls live a life of luxury hey ready yeah let's go guys please yes just take them off us richard james i should be there and you should be here yeah i saw the first [ __ ] pan of donuts charcoal yeah send the [ __ ] place yes i'm seriously unhappy with that because out of those 50 customers you managed to cook for one table but when i saw the way they were overcooked from the beginning there's no way on earth you guys are ready to step up and [ __ ] cook donuts you cook one table out there i hope the [ __ ] okay they're paying for them well that was a bit of a letdown okay yeah and thanks for calling me chef that's all i wanted from the out thank you very much clear down it was crispy and sugary and it was everything i wanted a dessert appearance wise i wasn't that impressed kind of looked like two brown balls just stuck there so i prodded it and then nice kind of the apples kind of came drooling out sort of thing and i thought oh this looks interesting i love the pudding but i don't think it does make up for the fact that we did wait for such a long time for our mayo that was a tough call okay gordon okay feedback for the donuts please they are quite disappointed about the waiting time few people think that the donut is a bit greasy that was a donut so they're supposed to be cooked in [ __ ] fat how many customers are gonna pay for their doughnuts okay we're having 12 none per year for the for the bonus there's a fresh apple compote injected into the donut before they went to the table let's start off with the starters the seller of tuna yeah brilliant well done all 50 customers agreed to pay for that [ __ ] starter the negative side we wasted a lot yeah the positive side they all paid for it the sea bass 21 customers refuse to pay for it a lot of waste a long way and there's a 12 refuse to pay so the total well done 117 dishes paid for yeah more importantly you [ __ ] hung in there yes the challenge was for you guys to cook for every [ __ ] table and make sure those customers paid i felt there's a big [ __ ] monkey on my back this evening because [ __ ] me was i doing a lot i think you could see that richard would you open your own restaurant now yeah a piece of pizza well done can we get a drink now can you get a drink cool [ __ ]

corn in so now get your lid never leave it far away from you sounds like it's raining it's not so it's popcorn canals trying to pop out boom delicious just a little shake of the pan get it going and then lift that lid at your apparel we see it's a very exciting pan in there and when all that little pitter patter stops you know your popcorn is cooked nice you could eat it fresh from the pan but i've got another plan i'm gonna make a salted caramel popcorn start off with your sugar into the hot pan never stir a caramel otherwise it crystallizes it's a salted caramel so a nice pinch of salt in there as well now once you've got it to a really nice dark caramel flavor stir in your butter very carefully caramel is very very hot half a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda kickstarts the reaction that gives the caramel a honeycomb flavor mix that in you'll see it reacting almost like a large crunchy in the bottom of your bowl now the gas is off and that camera has a nice dark rich flavor now pour in the popcorn to coat it with that incredible caramel give that a good mix it's that easy and it's gonna taste amazing lay that nice and flat once that cools down it becomes nice and brittle we've got that nice salted caramel flavor which just takes popcorn to a complete dim level whilst the popcorn cools down it's onto my prawn tostada wonderful prawns i'm gonna marinate them first with a little bit of garlic nice and fine and don't worry if you can't slice thinly just get a little crater and grate the garlic nice and fine as well nice pinch of chili flakes over your prawn garlic in salt pepper and olive oil give that a really nice little mix whilst the prawns marinade i'm gonna knock up a salad this is a really nice sort of light fragrant salad radishes topped and tailed and then into quarters cherry tomatoes halved spring onions sliced and seasoned and then just to liven things up a little bit of chili in there and slice them on an angle now the avocado cut in half give that a little twist so you just go down and down and down carefully with your knife turn it around go down and down and down and then you take your spoon and you've got your diced avocado coming out already now baby gem lettuce half then shred freshly squeezed lime juice and a little drizzle of olive oil tostada is a classic mexican style open tortilla so that lime complements it beautifully lastly roughly chopped coriander and give it a mix that is the perfect base for our tostada the salad's ready now for the prawns and don't be afraid of getting the pan nice and hot teaspoon of olive oil in anything less than that sizzle when you put that first prawn in there don't put them in keep them nice and flat make sure you've got all that marinade in there as well watch them change color rapidly i'd rather cook them quicker in a hotter pan and slower in a colder pan the difference in taste is night and day the prawns will take just two minutes to cook through lime juice just over the top nice toss them over the lime these are corn tortilla quite robust and it's a kind of base that doesn't disintegrate hot pan in it's a dry pan so that corn tortilla goes nice and crispy on the outside [Music] look crispy shell to build them generous with the salad that base will stay nice and crisp next with your prawns i like to keep the tails in to the center and lay the round part of the prawn on the outside and there we have a delicious yeah very humble prawn tostada followed by my superb salty caramel popcorn beautiful [Music] prawn tostadas and salty caramel popcorn vibrant irresistible smelling dishes you'll want to dive into big and bold i was living in france i stayed there for three years once twice a week i treated myself to the most amazing bold breakfast and it started off with these beauties here murgays cheap but incredibly tasty start off with a nice hot pan mug is in it's a very spicy sausage doesn't need any help doesn't even need chili just a touch of salt and pepper you can smell the spice they're starting to release all that wonderful oil that flavor in there add a couple of cloves i'll finely slice garlic spread the garlic across the pan it instantly changes color takes on this nice dark rich golden color now take a look with the heat out with the parsley the stalks of soft herbs like parsley and coriander can be used to impart flavour during cooking but the leaves should always be added just before serving to give maximum colour and fragrance [Music] and then finish that off with my capers amazing all right beautiful now take your quests on they're literally 24 hours old so they're crispy on the outside and just slice off the lid this recipe is a great way to use up any leftover croissants from the day before i used to cringe when i saw the french cooks throw away croissants i used to cry thinking oh my god any idea what you're throwing away in terms of flavor whatever you do do not wipe out that pan dunk your croissants mopping up all that amazing flavor and caramelizing the inside for that beautiful and don't forget the lids and then get your thumbs and go inside the croissant all i want to do now is just create a little pocket and just manipulate the crescent now this is where it gets exciting mix up the capers the garlic and sausages look at the color of that wonderful delicious flavored oil now some cheese but not just any cheese fontina cheese is like the number one cheese for grilling and because it's a very rich cheese you shave it thinner than you would a white truffle but it gives a really nice saltiness and a light smoky flavour salt place these big boys on the tray literally 30 seconds on the grill here we go nice crisp packed full of flavor now top them and that for me it's almost like being back in paris except this time i don't have to share them with the french my ultimate big and bold breakfast murgies and fontina stuffed croissants a great way to start the day [Music] jack hi my gonna help with some pickling please oh definitely no you love pickles right love pickles um favorite pickle what is it i like pickled onions we're going to do pickled celery mm-hmm it's a nice little snack and great for plum ones great for salads first thing we need to pick the celery for me so you see where the next one's going to be it's in there yeah okay i'll figure it out but i'm hungry today is this all we're having for dinner jack come on i wouldn't do that to you you know that there's more coming now because we're pickling it we want to sort of make it look a little bit more attractive so we go around like that okay on an angle so when you pick all the food does it does it preserve it it's exactly what it does but also gives it a really nice salty soury flavour yeah okay now splash of water and then with the sugar nice okay so gotta bring that up to the bowl and sort of create almost like a little syrup yeah okay little teaspoon of peppercorns in mustard seeds in quite generous on the mustard seeds that gives a bit of sort of spice now those you must know cloves excellent cloves in now touch of salt no okay so from there white wine vinegar now in order for all that to actually pickle you need to boil it so by boiling it okay it brings all the ingredients together it fuses all the spices and helps cook the celery have a little taste nice nice see i put some hairs on your chest yes it will look boom it's working already now see nice wine vinegar right celery's ready yeah okay let's walk to the ball now turn that off now from there start placing the celery into that jar so when you pick other foods can you use that same recipe exactly that 100 once it's pickled it doesn't really go off mm-hmm okay now put them in there so can we eat this straight away when it's in here do you know what as soon as it's cooled down you can definitely eat that straight away i can't wait to dig into it at dinner are they delicious yes we'll leave that to cool down our pickles are ready and cooling now to marinate the chicken when you fried chicken traditionally it's always gonna be done with the dark meat the brown meat so you've got that nice sort of uh drum here and this bit that thigh cooking on the bone as well keeps it even more moist so first things first salt pepper please from there famous buttermilk buttermilk in it's brilliant for marinating the chicken if you can put this buttermilk over your chicken the night before the more it tenderizes the chicken and starts to sort of really relax the chicken and puts a really nice sort of creamy soury flavor in there so might stick that in the fridge for us please and we'll start the dolce de leche biscuits nice the argentinians call these shortbreads alfa jorge and they're the favorite sweet treat on the streets of buenos aires they're light crumbly shortbread biscuits sandwiched with gloriously golden caramel dolce de leche sauce for the shortbread beat together softened butter granulated sugar and beat until light and fluffy add one egg [Music] slice vanilla pots scrape out the seeds add to the mix and beat again plain flour corn flour and baking powder then fold the mixture together using floured hands roll into small balls flatten into discs and place on a baking tray [Music] chill for 10 minutes until firm to touch then simply bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until pale golden once cooled sandwich two biscuits together with a caramelly dolce de leche sauce [Music] finish with a dusting of icing sugar [Music] delicious my dessert and pickles are ready the buttermilk should have worked its magic on the chicken all that's left is to fry it now we're gonna roll the chicken out of the buttermilk into the flour so that's why it gets nice and crispy and blistery on the outside okay cool so what we've got to make sure because the flour is the last coat yes this is nicely seasoned yeah okay so salt and pepper in there nice and this is smoked paprika so that gives it a little bit of sort of uh maybelline yeah yeah spice that's right a little bit of heat and this one my favorites what's that cayenne pepper that's right again slightly spicy but the heat works brilliantly well garlic powder traditionally are used a lot in the steaks onion powder garlic powder just run your fingers through that please cool i'm gonna get the pan on now two centimetres of oil this is a really good mix for fish as well mm-hmm goujons fighting a nice spicy texture helps fish so first thing is we just shake off some of the buttermilk lay that down yes okay really important to get them covered completely okay in the flour yeah okay so i love fried chicken do you now lift that up there first one and you place it in there away from you off you go nice and gently good and lay away good if any stage you think the oil is getting too hot yeah just add a touch of cold oil in there or turn off the gas good gently fry the chicken for 25 to 30 minutes or until cooked through now very carefully turn them over please yeah cool can we have this every day jack fried chicken every day no definitely not it's a treat and it's shallow fried so once every three weeks yeah sounds great to me yeah now off with the gas okay yeah paper ready okay onto the paper sell them i love fried chicken i'm telling you i'm pretty sure i love it morning look here's the best bit delicious now fried
