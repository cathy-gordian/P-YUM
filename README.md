**How do we utilize the various ways of audience response to characterize and measure the engagement levels of different food YouTube content creators? **

Recipe content is especially interesting as one of the ultimate goals of the recipe creator is for audiences to replicate their work. 
There is a direct aspect of emulation and reproduction. This opens up avenues for much interesting inspection of how audiences engage with content creators.
Are audiences actively recreating recipes, and if so, are they deeming these to be good recipes? Challenging recipes? Overly convoluted recipes? Are the ingredients
mentioned in the recipes easy to source? There are a myriad of questions that arise when the audience has their own creative output that adds another layer to the usual
comment / social media text analysis.

## Part 1: Data and Metrics

We first need to determine the metrics we will be using and the data we will be collecting. There are a lot of different metrics that we can develop and narrowing
them down to representative and interesting ones to examine will be challenging.

Once we have adequate metrics, we will need data that we can actively perform analysis on. This will involve large amounts of scraping in social avenues such as Instagram,
Twitter, YouTube comments. An additional scraping component involves the use of the YouTube API, which will be used to scrap video data, transcripts, and other characteristics
of the YouTube videos posted by creators.
