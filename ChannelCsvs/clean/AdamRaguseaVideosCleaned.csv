as always you'll be limited by your oven which probably doesn't get quite as hot as the ovens they use at buddies and it does make a difference that's a darn good pizza though easily my favorite of the thicker crust Styles you'll want to get a cup of water per 110 inches of pan area I've got that in metric in the description My Pan area is 165 inches so I need a cup and a half of water 355 mils a teaspoon and a half of dry yeast a teaspoon and a half of salt and I'm not going to bother measuring my bread flour at Buddy's their dough is about 65 percent hydration which would be about 550 grams of flour here that's about the hydration you're going to get if you just stir in as much flour as you can stir in with a spoon cover and let the particles hydrate let the gluten autolize for about 20 minutes come back dump in a little more flour that was probably too much flour your ham hands and you can more easily get the dough off of the spoon and then just knead the dough a little bit it's wetter now after resting so it will absorb a little more flour and after the auto lice you really only need to knead it for like a minute to get it stretchy 60 to 70 percent hydration is about that sticky sticky does are hard to work yes but it's really quite easy to push dough into a square pan so don't worry about it being sticky lean on the side of it being too sticky now I'll cover and actually let that rise for a couple hours or so until doubled during which time I can work on my cheese the original traditional Detroit style pizza is made with Wisconsin brick cheese which can be hard to find so I had to order an absurdly large block on the internet in effect it's kind of halfway between low moisture mozzarella and cheddar cheese this is a little more mature and funky and yellow than the brick cheese that they use at buddies but man does it melt really well and taste great I'm cutting off about 200 grams seven ounces for my pizza sure you could use a young better instead or low moisture mozzarella or a mixture of the two instead but you could also buy a big block of brick cheese like mine cut it up into portions and then freeze those for later semi-firm cheeses usually freeze and thaw really well at buddies they grind their cheese rather than shredding it they want bigger pieces to slow down the melting it's because a thicker Pizza needs more thyme in the oven and so you don't want the cheese to cook too quickly I can get a similar effect by just chopping this cheese into pretty coarse chunks and then once I've done that I'm actually going to throw this in the freezer in my home oven it's going to take even longer to bake and brown a thick crust so I want the cheese to melt slowly otherwise it's going to be a broken or even burned Mess by the time the pizza itself is done if you chill it you slow it down oh hey here's my sauce in the freezer buddies like many classic American pizza places uses canned tomato product from a company called Stanislaus that almost exclusively serves commercial operations hence this absolutely gigantic can I had to order off the internet I don't know if buddies uses this particular product from Stanislaus 711 ground Tomatoes but it's a favorite among New York pizza places and it legit tastes amazing I don't know what they do differently at Stanislaus but it works not an ad I cracked open the can I transferred its contents to ice cube trays and now I can thaw out exactly how much I need for a pizza anytime I'll need about a cup of sauce 237 mils for this pizza obviously you can just use the best canned smooth tomato product they have at your store whatever herbs and spices you like I'm using oregano and Thyme and a little garlic powder and some pepper buddies sauce tastes like they use those similar things but they go easy on the spices it's a very plain sauce I don't know if they do any olive oil in there but I really like that taste I do know their sauce is a little looser than this so I'm watering it down a little bit that looks about right the dough still needs to rise another hour so I'm gonna go chill maybe take a bath and enjoy some body wash from native sponsor of this video for the holidays I've got some scents from the special naughty and nice collection imagine how popular you'll be this time of year if you smell like sugar cookies spiked eggnog or my favorite warm cider and cinnamon I think I'll scrub a dub with spiked eggnog as I drink actual spiked eggnog which smells exactly the same as the body wash native body wash gets you a rich foamy lather even without the sulfates usually needed for foamy liquid soaps you get a nice residue free clean on your now silky smooth skin native uses really simple plant-based ingredients vegan and cruelty free and ph balanced with citric acid they have so many awesome creative scents not just the Christmassy ones native also makes deodorants and hand and body lotion treat yourself or someone on

this is a limited time offer with code regusia 6 you can also get 20 off any deodorant or lotion thank you native dough has risen and now it's time to get my pan what I've got is an 11 by 15 inch pre-seasoned Blue Steel Detroit style pizza pan that I bought online it's pretty similar to the ones they use it buddies I seasoned it again when I got it home you could absolutely just use a big aluminum cake pan or a half sheet pan your crust might not get quite as brown but it'll still be good we got to spread a film of olive oil all over the interior surface and we especially cannot forget the sides and the corners if the pizza sticks it's going to be up here so get oil there plus we want the oil to create that slightly fried Edge that is characteristic of this style pizza not too fried however I'm going to use a paper towel to get out some excess oil if there's too much oil you get a donut like effect that is just not right while your hands are still oily grab your risen dough plop it in the pan and do an initial stretch try to get it into as even of a rectangle as possible but don't stress if it snaps back on you and you can't get it to stay tucked into the corners we will now let this rest covered let it proof for about half an hour and now it is Puffy and the gluten is relaxed I can stretch it out into the corners which you want to do because the corners are the best part just be gentle and don't deflate the dough you can always let it sit and poof again for a few more minutes if you deflate it the basic buddies Pie has a layer of small pepperoni slices under the cheese I could only get big slices so I'm cutting them into quarters before I lay them on small pieces mean you won't have giant slices of pepperoni sliding out of the pie and onto your lower lip as you eat cheese layer goes on next our cold coarsely chopped brick cheese that will melt nice and slow in the oven at buddies they make an effort to let some cheese fall along the side where it can Brown against the hot metal now the sauce goes on top similar to Chicago style pizza but unlike Chicago they do not flood the top in Detroit at buddies they do three narrow strips they call racing stripes in tribute to the Detroit automotive industry as a result most of the cheese will still be able to Brown and that is good I've had my oven heating as hot as it can get for about a half hour and in we go highest possible setting convection if you've got it my pizza took about 15 minutes basically you have to pull it when the cheese is starting to break really bad when the casein proteins tighten up and start squeezing out orange grease I wish my crust was a little darker by now but that's just how it is baking at 550 Fahrenheit in a domestic oven instead of the 7 or 750 oven they use at buddies let the pie rest and solidify for a second but you'll want to get it out of the pan pretty quick to avoid a Soggy Bottom use a metal spatula to go around the edge and scrape off any cheese or crust that is sticking I imagine this pan will get less sticky the more I use it and the more that seasoning layer develops then I can use that spatula to get up under the pie and help me kind of lever it out at buddies they would cut this into eight rectangular pieces and so shall I if New Yorkers are thinking hey that looks like Sicilian pizza yeah Detroit Pizza is descended from Sicilian svichione not as dark as I'd like it but that edge is still awfully crispy and we've got some decent golden brown on the bottom the crust is nice and light and springy and I love the heterogeneity of having sauce in like narrow stripes on top but the real secret to the flavor is the hidden layer of pepperoni on the dough really great if you can I think you should go to Detroit and taste the real thing for yourself at buddies but if you can't go to Detroit that is like 85 percent the authentic product and it's a great way to make a lot of pizza for a large group at home much love to the Motor City
AGE your raw egg eggnog,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sflZWeCjdco/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLAAtee7QS_3xGF8KU1FHn-BQeFTmw,sflZWeCjdco,"10 minutes, 14 seconds","Buy the Adam Ragusea chef knife for Christmas or whatever you're into! https://www.adamragusea.com/store/ragusea-chef-knife

Thanks to Dr. Vincent Fischetti at Rockefeller University: https://www.r...",29:02.6, eggnog like so many old-fashioned cocktails is made with raw eggs raw eggs give cocktails some viscosity and potentially some bubbles if you shake or whip the drink eggnog is raw eggs milk and or cream sugar and a healthy dose of brown liquor like brandy or Rum that healthy dose of liquor is not only conducive to a good holiday cheer it might also serve to make the drink healthier or at least less likely to have you writhing around on the floor of your bathroom all Christmas nobody really knows the origin of eggnog or the origin of its curious name written accounts of the drink first appear in 18th century Britain and America Oxford English Dictionary says nog is an old East anglian word for a kind of strong ale so perhaps the drink was originally just raw egg in beer on the other hand nog is also a very old word referring to a kind of wooden Peg and here in the Americas nog came to refer to a kind of wooden mug that people would drink from from I would guess because a mug is also a cylindrical shape like a peg also in the Americas rum came to be referred to kind of informally as Grog so if you thickened up some rum with a raw egg you would be drinking egg in Grog and you might serve it in a nog therefore people have long argued that egg in Grog in nog got squished into eggnog but the famous linguist Ben Zimmer disagrees he says there's just no textual evidence to support that explanation amusing though it may be he raises the possibility that nog might be derived from a Scottish word nug meaning ale wormed with a hot poker I guess if you wanted a warm drink but you did not have a fire safe vessel you could warm your poker in the fire and then put it into the drink and it would go anyway eggnog evolved into the sweet Rich Dairy drink that we traditionally have at Christmas there are several recipes attributed to founding U.S President George Washington historians at Mount Vernon Washington's Plantation turned Museum they say these recipes are apocryphal they may be real vintage recipes but they have nothing to do with Washington let's assume this is a real vintage recipe however so we've got cream milk sugar Brandy Rye rum and Sherry separate the egg so you can beat the whites before folding them in and then check this set in a cool place for several days lots of very old eggnog recipes tell you to age your eggnog before you drink it to age it for days or even weeks my hypothesis is this procedure might have been born of agricultural necessity in the days before climate controlled chicken coops chickens generally stopped laying eggs in the winter at least in cold climates if you wanted to preserve some eggs for the winter one option may have been to mix the them with booze I have no textual evidence to support my claim here but it is a fact that ethanol is a preservative and people might have simply noticed that aged eggnog also tended to taste better hence this eggnog recipe which I got from a microbiologist at Rockefeller University named Dr Vincent fischetti he got it from his predecessor when I started at Rockefeller about 60 plus years ago one of the traditions of in the lab was Rebecca lancefield was a famous scientist at the time and still passed away in in the 80s but as a famous scientist uh she would have it at uh Thanksgiving time we she would set up um an eggnog she would have at home recipe and we all got together and she would make the recipe in front of all of us and I carried on that tradition for for the next 30 or 40 years so here is Dr lansfield's recipe instead of whipping the egg whites she just whipped the cream in order to get a froth that's nice that way you don't have to separate the eggs but her first step is quote beet eggs add Bourbon and rum slowly with stirring to prevent precipitation of egg proteins you can tell this was written by a microbiologist precipitation means denaturation of the of the egg proteins and it just falls out of solution so it's actually just just Globs of protein I'm going to show you what that would look like and instead of the rum I'm going to use a Everclear because it's clear so you can see what's happening also Everclear is 95 alcohol so the effect is going to be all the more dramatic the booze chemically Cooks the egg white instantly ethanol disrupts the surface of the egg proteins makes them fall out of solution and unfold tangling and bonding with each other in this big coagulated Mass heat does the same basic thing when you cook if you mix the booze in slowly you still denature the proteins but at least stop them from flocculating together in giant clumps so let's make Dr lansfield's recipe it's in the description and I've scaled it down I'm not trying to licker up a whole department with a cup of cream 237 mils until you've got nice Peaks but stop before it looks like cottage cheese grab a bigger bowl and crack in two eggs try not to bump the camera start beating those and then gradually drizzle in a cup and a half 355 mils of any brown liquor mixture that you want I've got a cup of rum and half a cup of rye whiskey Dr fishetti thinks this step is probably important adding the booze directly to the eggs instead of mixing it in later if there's any bacteria in there we're probably killing a lot of them right now in pretty short order once smooth you can mix in the sugar I like half a cup 100 grams but some people might like it sweeter and then I've got another cup 237 mils of unwipped cream but you can use milk instead last ingredient is the whipped cream just get that mixed in and you can see how thick this mixture is part of that thickness is provided by the egg proteins that we chemically cooked transfer that into some sealable vessel and that is it tastes amazing tastes like an extremely boozy milkshake but is there still some salmonella risk salmonella has been virtually eradicated from British eggs because the Brits vaccinate the chickens we don't do that here in the United States that said American eggs are a lot safer nowadays than they were back in the 20th century when we had some big salmonella scares still if you're going to be serving old people or anyone who doesn't have a very good immune system I think you should take the salmonella risk pretty seriously and this leads us to the last line in Dr lansfield's recipe leave standing at least overnight with a lid slightly ajar in refrigerator I assume because the NOG might off gas and if you sealed this really tightly it could explode anyway she says serve after two to three weeks in the cold we make it to the week before Thanksgiving um and then we have it for Thanksgiving and then everyone goes away for Thanksgiving recess and we just keep it in the cold room until Christmas and that we have it for our Christmas party and actually it's better at Christmas than it was in Thanksgiving and it's probably safer after it ages Dr faschetti is running a bacteriology lab there so he's got vials of salmonella just sitting around and one year they decided to do a little experiment we made the recipe and we spiked it with salmonella so we added quite a bit of salmonella to the to the eggnog and then we took samples we put it away in the cold room as we would do normally on the same day they mixed it up there were still live salmonella in there then they checked after three days and the population of live salmonella was significantly reduced they checked at three weeks and it was gone there was no bacteria left after three weeks booze basically does the same thing to the bacteria that it does to the egg proteins it denatures their membrane the bacteria has a cell wall and a membrane and the alcohol will just the nature of the membrane and and just kill the organism so here's my freshly mixed batch I'm just curious how stable the foam is going to be over time so I'm marking the level there here we are after three weeks in the fridge and while the mixture has separated a bit the level is still the same no cream bubbles popped that's surprisingly stable exactly which element of the mixture has settled to the bottom well let's use a straw to take a core sample and taste the tiny bit that comes out of the straw first yep that is booze straight booze at the bottom but the cream on top also tastes really boozy so everything in there is in contact with alcohol and that's good if we want to kill bacteria I'm just shaking that to get everything homogeneous again before I drink it and as Dr fishetti said the Aged product tastes a lot more mellow and complex all kinds of chemical reactions occur when alcohol mixtures age insanely delicious but is it safe safe enough for me imma drink all of this but it's important to remember that that experiment they did at Rockefeller was not fit for scientific publication ideally you would want to repeat the experiment several times you'd want to maybe change up the variables a little bit the time and the temperature that would be the only way to prove that this is safe you'd also want to find the minimum amount of booze necessary to kill any salmonella but no scientist has done that experiment yet the Rockefeller University recipe is extremely boozy if you age it for at least three weeks I feel confident serving that to my guests but you do what is safe for you and your people a little nutmeg on top is traditional and a Merry Christmas to me hey speaking of the season of giving the Adam regusia chef knife is again for sale at adamregusia.com and uh it's pretty sweet it's the knife that I use in all of my videos and in all of my cooking at home I love this knife I designed it myself

***RECIPE***

Cut up some onions and peppers. Cook them in a big pot until soft. Dump...",29:02.6, Chile is a very broad category of stews or soups descending from Texas and Northern Mexico which of course used to be the same place and in my humble opinion there is a secret to a perfect bowl of chili gotta start with some chilies of course you can use fresh you can use dried you can use a mixture hot mild whatever you like a bell pepper is a mild chili you can cut them in half and pull the seeds out just because the seeds are kind of yucky and if you want to limit the heat you can pull out the ribs in which the seeds sit I just cut each of these halves into strips so that I can cut across the strips to get a nice dice any kind of onion will do just a rough Chop on that remember it's a stew it Cooks a while so the pieces are going to fall apart they don't have to be perfect or especially fine some oil in a pot throw in the veg you could also throw in some carrots or cauliflower or something for some extra vegetables in your diet I'll just cook that over pretty high heat for about 10 minutes to soften everything give it all a head start that looks good enough remember it's going to cook some more chili isn't always a tomato stew but in its contemporary form it's usually a tomatoey stew I like this brand of canned tomatoes not an ad and the fire roasted kind are really good for chili I'm doing two big cans of crushed tomatoes but you could use less you could use tomatillos and make green chili now of course chili in this context is short for chili con carne chili with meat so we need some tough cut of beef suitable for stewing I'm using oxtail today and no three or four cans of beans that's the secret chili is beans in spicy tomato sauce yes originally it was meat but it has evolved into part Meat part beans or sometimes all beans and who Among Us needs more beef in our diet just eat beans in the 21st century developed World beans are better for individual and planetary health for most meals for most people beans are better soak some dried beans overnight if you want and then throw them in but cans are almost as good and far faster of course the secret is to drain and rinse the canned beans and no just dump in the Bean Juice the Bean Juice is just some of the soluble carbs and proteins and such from the Bean for a stew like chili we need some water and we need a little starch for thickening and the bean goo is full of starch because beans are seeds just like grains they just have more protein than grains because of nitrogen fixing bacteria that grow on the roots of legumes oh what about the added salt in the bean goo well weren't you going to season your stew anyway just don't add as much salt anyway bring that to a simmer if you're using soaked dried beans you'll have to simmer them for at least an hour or two until the beans are soft canned beans are already soft but the stew does taste better if you simmer it anyway for like a half hour now the spices must be the authentic mixture of no there's no such thing just dump in stuff from your spice rack until you like how it tastes cumin is pretty standard as would be some kind of dried smoked chili smoked paprika is easy to find and it's not spicy you can always add spice with cayenne or something if you want the heat oregano is pretty standard and pre-packaged chili spice mixes usually include a ton of garlic powder for a reason garlic powder is the easiest way to make nearly any stew taste way better I don't even know what this one is but it's red so I'm putting it in the chili chili is just beans and spicy tomato sauce make it up as you go along stir it in give it a taste needs way more smoked paprika and cumin and I think I'll do some mustard powder too because I just want more pungency and I only need like a pinch of salt because the canned goods were already salty and that's totally fine as long as you account for it but what you really need to make this authentically Mexican is some of the traditional Mexican chocolate that they use in Savory dishes down there or you can just dump in some dark chocolate chips you're gonna get the same exact effect you won't notice the sugar because the tomato sauce is already Sweet honestly just a little dark chocolate melted in there really does a lot to make this taste like more than just beans and spicy tomato sauce which is all chili is that tastes really good I could eat it every day and we will for the next three days this is what most home-cooked meals should be in my opinion a big nutritionally complete and mostly meatless stew or soup that you just throw together one night and eat for the next three weeknights get your variety on the weekends this is a far more sustainable way to cook and eat for most of your meals both from the standpoint of your time and from the standpoint of individual and planetary Health more sustainable you don't have to love it to just eat it it's fuel for your body so that you can do the things that you want to do not every meal has to be like a trip to the amusement park for God's sake how badly have I contributed to that self-destructive expectation just eat beans and sauce hey now that I've been yelling at you for a while allow me to sell you something the Adam ragusia custom chef knife is back for sale again at adamrecusia.com just in time for the holiday gift giving season it's almost as though we kind of planned it that way last time we sold these a few months ago we sold out within a week it's the same great knife that everybody seems to have loved so far same Great Piece of German steel that's easy to care for and easy to sharpen incredibly sharp this is same laser engraving of our little inside joke and I suppose there is one difference in this new edition that devotees will notice there's the price same as before and unlike before we are able to sell outside the United States this time in these select countries however if you're getting it from those countries then you're going to be paying some potentially steep shipping and maybe even import tariffs sorry just this is such a small deal such a small batch of knives that we couldn't interest any European distribution houses and doing this with us it's just too little for them so we're shipping them all from the United States and that's going to be kind of expensive but if you have an Adam ragusia Super Fan in your life I'm sure they will appreciate it it's got the same super durable engineered pack of wood handle as before I will say one thing I heard from people who bought the knife the last time was they said the kind of shine on this handle wore off after they washed it for a while that's a good thing it ships with sort of a protective coating on it it just washes off as you wash it and then actually you get a better grip on the knife as it goes to more of a matte finish on here that's that's that's a feature not a buck and the only bad experiences I've heard about people having when they use this knife is if they put it in the dishwasher do not put a good chef knife in the dishwasher ever always wash it by hand dishwasher would mess up the handle I continue to use this knife for almost everything I do at home myself it's everything that I want in a chef knife it's got that nice hybrid Asian and European shape that I think is pretty much perfect got really heavy heft to the handle nice weight in this Full Tang that goes all the way down through the handle it's one piece of Steel and it really is the best piece of Steel I can give you for a reasonable cost now some people have noticed that some comparable quality in knives are are on the market that don't cost quite as much as my knife and they asked me well does he like your knife cut better or something the answer is no probably not the reason it costs more is because it's got like my logo and stuff on it it's a small little Boutique order we don't have much economy of scale when I'm only ordering enough knives to be made for you know you it's not a huge thing and so yeah there's some extra cost associated with it being the Adam regusia knife but again if you've got a Super Fan in your life this is the holiday gift giving season as I record this it comes in this box and it's got my little note in it totally giftable I cannot guarantee that shipping will get to you by say Christmas but that is like the whole idea that's why we're doing this now in the middle of November to give you plenty of time to order and get the knife delivered to you in time for holiday gift giving if you're ordering it overseas I'm honestly not sure what's going to happen but if you get on it now I'm pretty sure we have a good chance of getting you everything that you need for the big day thank you so much for your support and for your interest it's ridiculous to me that people would want my chef knife but there it is adamregusia.com go and get it oh and keep your vinegar well you know

***RECIPE, SERVES 4-6***

1.5 lb...",29:02.6, here's a slightly gussied up version of classic southern U.S chicken and dumplings I made this for company the other day quite a thing for a Brisk fall evening I'm especially happy with how the dumplings themselves turned out lots of flavor in there nice light texture traditionally you'd start by just boiling a whole chicken in water to make chicken soup but I'm going with the far more convenient and consistent boneless skinless thighs about a pound and a half 700 grams that might not sound like a ton of meat for like six portions but remember there's no bone no skin that's all net weight and I'm just snipping each thigh into maybe four pieces I'm gonna cook this until the meat is falling apart so the chunks we eat will actually be even smaller but if you don't cut them up front you're going to get super long strings of meat that I think are undesirable I'm shortening the meat fibers here and I'm using scissors instead of a knife so that I don't have to wash The Cutting Board now I'm going to start this more like a stew than a soup enough Pepper for every piece some mixed dried herbs enough salt for every piece and then enough flour to coat like half a cup 50 or 60 grams and toss this is how I do breadings whenever possible season the food instead of the flour or the breadcrumbs or whatever it's much easier to eyeball the seasoning quantity on the meats than on a pile of flour Heat a good film of oil if you have bacon grease or some such this would be a great time to use that instead you really got to lay the pieces into one at a time if you just dump them in all at once they're going to congeal into a giant slimy meatball because I've completely filled my pot with meat and because I'm on a wheat gas stove I am on high heat but you be conservative if you don't know your stove you don't want anything to burn nor do you want to try to flip those pieces until they have browned well on the bottom if they aren't Brown they're going to stick really bad a wooden spoon is definitely the best way to nudge the pieces off the pan you can really dig down underneath them without scratching the pan once I've got those flipped I will run over here and cut eight ounces to 27 grams of mushrooms in half the biggest ones I'll quarter but they're going to shrink a ton oops I got a little burning happening over here that could absolutely dissolve in the soup and spoil the flavor the solution is to grab a wet paper towel with tongs and scrub the burned spot clean better yet don't burn anything at all these pieces are brown enough I'll push them over to one side and throw in my mushrooms to get a little color on them I might even push the pot a little bit off the heat so that the chicken doesn't burn the heat is only under the mushroom side now I keep coming back to green onions as my favorite form of onion these days two bunches lose the roots they're easy to cut they give you some onion and they give you some nice bright green garnish I will Reserve said garnish for later and throw the whites in with the mushrooms just give them a couple of minute Head Start and if you're thinking now's about the time Adam would totally deglaze with an entire bottle of white wine well you'd be right water or stock would be fine instead I've got a pound of carrots here thick sliced carrots take about the same time to Stew soft as chunks of dark meat chicken do so I'll get those in right away then a whole carton of chicken stock remember it's supposed to be more of a soup than the stew so lots of liquid a pinch or two of salt to start with we can always add more at the end maybe I'll grab what's left of this garlic head cut off the root ends bash to loosen the skin and I'll just throw those smashed cloves in there whole they'll just melt over the long cooking stir bring to a boil reduce to a spirited simmer and then you're going to cover and do something else for 45 minutes it's not a super long cook but it's still not as fast of a meal as hellofresh is with the holidays around the corner man is hellofresh gonna help with weeknight cooking around here skip the lines at the grocery stores save on the cost of takeout hellofresh is about 25 percent less expensive than takeout on average several nice chilly weather options there but this pasta is a favorite of ours and you'll see that it takes less than half an hour because because I'm doing this in one shot and my camera can only record 30 minutes at a time got all my pre-portioned ingredients here which minimize waste we're on the vegetarian meal

simmering the chicken and the carrots are almost tender so I will now add in this 12 ounce 340 gram bag of green beans just cut those into spoonable size pieces add a simmer these will take half an hour max to soften we want to drop our dumplings when everything is 15 minutes from being done I've got a lot of fresh Rosemary and Sage here very cozy flavors I'll chop that up nice and fine because I'm putting it in my dumplings usually the dumplings are kind of bland and they're flavored by the broth I think it's kind of fun to reverse that and what's crazy good inside the dumplings is lemon zest just try it the juice will put in the broth later on that's what happens when you watch the camera monitor instead of watching reality close one regusia if you have cake flour in the house use that instead of all-purpose but all-purpose will be okay about two cups 230 grams cake flour is lighter than AP less protein softer dumpling texture I'd say two teaspoons of baking powder because we're making Southern Style Chicken and Dumplings where the dumplings are more like biscuits than noodles I think half a teaspoon of salt is enough but you could do a little more garlic powder on the inside of the dumplings that really taste good just trust me in with the herbs and the lemon zest then I'll grab two or three tablespoons of butter melt it Pour it in and then mix if you mix in the fat before you mix in the water you coat lots of the flour in fat you're gonna block some gluten development and get super tender dumplings also for tender dumplings you don't want to mix up this batter until right before you're ready to drop it into the soup now just mix in just enough milk or water to make this come together into a Shaggy sloppy dough like a cup of liquid Max it is absolutely key to not over hydrate or over mix this it should be a mess you should just barely be able to roll this into little balls the fault lines created by uneven mixing will get you a nice crumbly texture don't go any bigger than these Balls by the way because they're going to double in size when they cook just drop them into the broth make sure the heat is high enough that you've got a low boil you need that heat to activate the baking powder in there and get these to puff up put the lid on so the tops of The Dumpling Steam and don't pee week in there for at least 10 minutes while I wait here's my fancy Finishing Touch not traditional at least not outside of Louisiana I'm going to thicken and enrich my soup with a liaison five or six eggs I'll fish out the yolks and eat the whites for breakfast tomorrow in classic French cooking I believe the typical ratio is one part egg yolks to three parts cream mix that up smooth and we will add that little custard at the last second the dumplings are done when they look done you can always tear one open it should look like bread on the inside not dough if you overcook them they get very dense so 10 or 15 minutes max I will now reduce my heat until I see no more bubbles it is now safe for me to stir in my liaison people say that you have to do this whole tempering maneuver but if you stir it in briskly off the boil it's going to be fine you might have to turn the heat back up ever so slightly to cook this you should see the liquid noticeably thicken just a little when the eggs cook of course if you overcook them the eggs are going to curdle the soup will look gritty that there is a perfect velvety broth you could just use cream straight cream is safer but you need a lot more cream to achieve the same textural effect and you wouldn't get the extra flavor and the color of the eggs heat off to be safe with the eggs and now I will taste for seasoning needs a little more salt and I'll squeeze in maybe half of my lemon if I hadn't used the white wine I'd probably do the whole lemon and I've got my reserved onion greens to stir in at the last second thereby keeping them green and pretty there you go slightly elevated cold weather comfort food I love how the stew-like flower coating we did on the chicken kind of melts into the broth and merges the elements together and I'm so happy with these dumplings the strong herb and lemon and garlic flavor in there is just insane not exactly a low cal dinner but we did go very heavy on vegetables relative to the other elements please don't take my version of this dish as being traditional there's all kind kinds of traditional ways to make chicken and dumplings and maybe we'll do one of those another day

Visit https://audible.com/adam...",29:02.6, if you love baked pasta casseroles but only the brown crispy top layer well you can have a dinner that is only the top layer this vegetable heavy sheet pan pasta dinner is a riff on a recipe my wife Lauren has been making which is in turn a riff on a New York Times recipe and please don't consider it a recipe it's just a technique use whatever ingredients you have and flavors you like get a little pot of water coming to a boil for the pasta big pinch of salt in there first thing I'm going to do is make a seasoned breadcrumb topping I'll zest this lemon you could even do two lemons we're gonna use the juice at the end then I'll grate some cheese this is pecorino don't ask me how much it's just a pile knock all that sticky lemon zest out of there I'll pick some fresh thyme leaves but any fresh herb would be fine then I've got one red chili sliced thin and I will stop when I get to the top where most of the seeds and the Heat live a couple of cloves of garlic cut off the root ends smashed to release the skin and peel then I'll just chop all of these things into each other it absolutely could be placebo effect but I could swear that aromatic ingredients create new and better aromatic compounds when you chop them into each other like this regardless it all needs to be chopped up fine so you might as well do it in one big mess in a bowl with you and then I will mix in a roughly equal quantity of Panko bread crumbs any kind of breadcrumb is fine but panko is basically always better it's crispier get that really well Blended and there's our topping next I'll grate up half a pound 226 grams of low moisture mozzarella cheese though honestly I think fresh mozzarella would also work here throw that in a bowl we won't need it until the end here's a pound 454 grams of Brussels sprouts for each one I will cut off the stem end and I'm going to quarter them you could get away with halves if they're small any decayed outer leaves should just fall off in the process of cutting I love roasted brussels sprouts but you could use any vegetable that roasts well as long as you can cut it into pretty small pieces cauliflower would be Dynamite I think the times uses broccoli I'm not wild about roasted broccoli but you do you nyt here's my sheet pan onto that I will spread like 4 ounces 113 grams of thickly diced pancetta you could use any fatty cured meat as long as it's in reasonably big chunks sausage would be great you could skip the meat entirely or use two three times as much I'm just throwing it into a cold oven I will turn on the broiler slash Grill and let the meat heat up slowly meanwhile I can mow through my second one pound bag of Brussels sprouts I'm using two pounds of sprouts and half a pound or half a box of pasta that's going to get me a really healthy vegetable heavy meal but you could use just like one pound of sprouts and the whole box of pasta and you would get more traditional proportions and now is probably a good time for me to drop my pasta any big chunky shape will work but really the perfect one I think is Casta Kelly that's the new shape famously designed by my old public radio buddy Dan pashman host of the sporkful podcast half a pound of that 223 grams into the pot you know I've been listening to Dan's book lately on Audible sponsor of this video it's called eat more

thank you audible anyway fat melts at a relatively low temperature so starting the pancetta in a cold oven gave the fat lots of time to render out before the meat started to cook and brown under that Broiler it looks almost done which is good the meat will not really be able to get much crispier once we mix in two pounds of Brussels sprouts I've got a couple of carrots I can throw in there too if I slice them thin they should cook in about the same time as the Sprouts carrots on the pile and then enough salt to basically season all of the veg all of the other elements of this dish come with their own salt I'm just tossing everything in the salt and rendered fat of which there is plenty I am not burning myself all of this Mass has sucked all the heat out of the pan and the fat but you can use a spatula or something to be safe and if you're not using meat just toss all of this in olive oil get everything to a nice even layer so that it Cooks evenly and then back under the broiler it goes the package says to boil this pasta for 13 minutes I've had it boiling for 10 minutes so I'm gonna stop now and drain it's going to soften some more as it sits around and it's going to soften even more in the oven later I've got a couple of shallots that I'm going to peel and dice fine if I was using a full sized onion I would have put that in with the Sprouts but shallot layers are thinner so they're going to cook faster sprouts look maybe halfway done it's been been maybe five minutes now I'll throw on the shallots oh also I wanted a little handful of whole fennel seeds though honestly any spice would be fine just put it in maybe halfway through the cooking so that it doesn't burn toss toss toss get everything coated in pancetta fat and back under the broiler now I can clean up a little and oh give that drained pasta a shake every now and then otherwise all the pieces are going to glue together okay veg looks almost done I'm going to turn my Broiler off right now because if you leave it on for too long it can trip a breaker that's designed to keep the element from overheating and melting down onto your food about a third of my grated mozzarella goes on followed by all of my pasta and now I will toss the purpose of this dose of cheese is to hold all the pieces together in a little melty Matrix level that off smooth then I'm gonna drop in a half pound 223 gram tub of ricotta cheese in dollops this offers some nice creamy heterogeneity and the tops of the dollops brown really nice under the broiler Nestle them in there I say use the full at ricotta otherwise it just tastes like nothing my remaining mozzarella I will scatter on top kind of avoiding the ricotta dollops because I want those to be able to Brown same deal with my seasoned breadcrumb topping get it everywhere except on the ricotta man that topping smells really good now I'll just drizzle everything with olive oil olive oil tastes great and will enhance Browning throw it under and watch it carefully it'll only need a few minutes before things start to burn if you don't have a broiler that super hot top element that Brits call a grill I'd say just crank your oven as hot as it'll go it'll take more time and more electricity and the Browning won't be quite as nice but you'll still get an excellent dinner it really is like the top layer of the casserole fired the bottom layer and went solo squeeze on the juice from that lemon that is key in my opinion I might even like two lemons for this much food which is enough for four people at least I suppose you could cut it into sections and slide them onto plates but I say everybody just gathers around the pan with forks the pan will keep everything hot thin food goes cold fast look at the Browning on that piece of Casta Kelly you don't even notice that you're eating mostly vegetables nice

I've been developing recipes professionally almost four years now and I don't think I've come up with a better tip than starting your cookies under the broiler slash Grill it results in uncommonly pretty cookies with some caramelized flavor in the flaky top I've been trying to refine my old recipe lately and here it is with precise measurements this time a stick 113 grams unsalted butter just melt it down in the microwave you could Brown the butter some people who aren't me really like the taste of that but be aware that Browning also boils off the like 15 percent of butter that is water so you'll either need to add a little water or reduce the flour a bit 200 grams of sugar for granulated sugar that would be one cup but I'm using powdered sugar which makes for a slight Improvement in appearance you get a smoother surface on the cookie it doesn't make a huge difference don't go out of your way to find powdered sugar for this try brown sugar for flavor or drop in a little dab of molasses because brown sugar is just sugar Sugar Plus a little molasses give that a preliminary beating mostly to lower the temperature of the butter in case the butter is so hot that it's going to prematurely cook the egg beat the egg in if you're using granulated sugar you can get a similar effect to what I'm getting here by just beating for an extra couple of minutes at this stage let the sugar dissolve a bit in the water from the egg and the butter nice pudding like texture of that from the powdered sugar and from the fact that I didn't get my butter super hot if the butter was hotter the mixture would be runnier at this stage that doesn't really matter either way it's just a good cautionary note about judging the content of a dough by its consistency something I probably do a little too much I like a whole teaspoon of this kosher salt the kind of salt only matters in as much as different salts will measure out differently by volume 10 grams is what I like which is going to be noticeably salty you might like less you know I used to be an advocate for baking powder in these cookies but after I tested it I think I prefer simple baking soda in chewy cooking these at least for cakey cookies you want the baking powder which has an acid and a base baking soda is just the base half a teaspoon of that maybe three grams it's a subtle thing but baking soda just tastes a little better here acid does inhibit Browning everything in me is saying just slosh in some vanilla but I'm measuring it out for you let's say two teaspoons vanilla extract which is how much eight grams there you go you might like less Vanilla some people say I put in too much having tested it side by side I really do think these come out better with bread flour bread flour makes chewier cookies Browner cookies but all-purpose flour is okay this double zero flour is super finely ground which again gets you a nicer smoother top flower grind doesn't matter that much to this but it's nice and in all of my experiments I determined that the best quantity of flour relative to a stick of butter is 230 grams which is about a cup and a half of bread flour AP flour is lighter so it measures out differently mix that up nice and smooth honestly even going by weight has been a little hit and miss for me as far as getting the perfect cookie goes higher protein flour absorbs more water etc etc measuring by weight can lull you into a false sense of security the key here is to get enough flour that the dough is that sticky if it's not sticky at all you're going to get taller drier kind of scone-like cookies that's what would happen by the way if you boiled out all the water from the butter but did not lower the flour accordingly if it's way more sticky than this the cookies are going to spread super thin in the oven I find that if it feels just a little too sticky to me it's perfect and you could put in chocolate chips or whatever but today I'm putting in M M's just for funsies and a hundred grams is the right amount of any chocolate for me that's proportionally less chocolate than what the classic Toll House recipe calls for but Toll House is in the business of selling chocolate chips so what do you expect since the dough is a little sticky you can make it easier to shape by chilling it in the fridge for a bit make it more solid but based on my recent experiments the fridge makes no difference in how the cookies actually bake I usually bake cookies on parchment paper but the paper does burn a little with this method and that makes a nasty smell so I'm going bare pan today if you care that much about Precision 115 grams each is a good weight for half a dozen big cookies I just roll them out into golf balls first no non-stick spray on the pan by the way with these cookies at least the spray does almost nothing to inhibit sticking and it gives a slight fried flavor to the base that I don't like now I go back and flatten each ball into a little puck you can skip this but they bake prettier and more evenly if they start as pucks and if you really care about Aesthetics you can refine the circles a little bit before baking I've had my oven heating already to 375 fahrenheit 190 Celsius convection but I will immediately turn that off and turn the broiler on high what the Brits call a grill is up here at the top it heats up in a minute or two and if you don't have one just bake the cookies normally it's going to be fine under my Broiler this stage takes 90 seconds tops once you have golden brown domes that will crack in attractive patterns as the cookies spread get them out fast before they burn if you have multiple pans of cookies Brown them one at a time it'll go real fast now I'll turn the broiler off and the convection bake back on give the broiler a minute or two to cool down the oven itself is already at the right temperature because we preheated yes the word preheat has valid use cases and I just gave you one pet ants if you don't have a convection fan blowing in there you're going to be fine just maybe rotate the pans halfway through to help them bake more evenly conventional ovens have hot spots that the fan helps to even out and the fan accelerates baking a bit these only needed like eight more minutes for the texture I like I pull them when they look just a hair under baked and that is that so the broil then bake procedure that I invented accidentally one day when I turned on the broiler instead of the oven which I meant to turn on I think this replicates the look of a bake done in a Professional Steam injection oven the steam gels the outer starch layer and gets you that smooth effect that's just my guess let these cool and solidify before you try to scrape them off the pan if you just gotta have hot soft gooey cookies we'll bake them on parchment paper once cooled a bit these scrape off just fine with my thin silicone spatula and I've been eating cookies all day so Lauren is going to take this bite for me if the texture seems a bit too firm for you try them again in the morning they will soften unless you live in a desert with no humidity there you go in four years

it's a retro mid-century mom classic for sure but a classic for a reason if you need a whole lot of hearty food that you don't have to fuss over you can't go wrong with a tuna noodle casserole and honestly you could skip the tuna this particular recipe is distantly descended from a Martha Stewart recipe my wife was trying one day and we were like wait this is not gonna taste like anything so we started jazzing it up and I'm doing it as a one pan meal a big stove safe baking dish or any big oven safe pan a whole stick of butter 113 grams or you could use like half a cup of olive oil 120 mils I'm just melting that over moderate heat maybe give it a little help so that the melted part doesn't burn before the rest is liquefied now I'll whisk in half a cup of all-purpose flour 60 grams to make a roux might seem like too much flour at first but a rule loosens up as it Cooks I don't know why whisk it smooth and then keep whisking as it cooks for a couple of minutes just to get get the raw flour taste out and maybe develop a few little nutty flavor notes I see it just starting to turn brown it smells cooked that's enough time to start whisking in a whole quart of milk which is just over a liter a little bit at a time especially early on when we're whisking out the lumps you could use any non-dairy milk you could use some Veggie stock plain water it'd be fine yes I'm showing you this entire assembly in one shot so you can see how dead simple this recipe is if you were to dump the liquid in all at once you would lose the viscosity that you need to whisk the lumps out the lumps would just Bob around in a pool of milk once you've got the lumps out you can pour in a lot more aggressively the wheat starch will gelatinize and thicken as that comes up to a simmer and we will have bechamel sauce now green beans you always want to snip off the stem end the stem is totally unchewable but I leave the flower end that doesn't bother me I'm going to grab a handful of green beans at a time hold on let me stir the sauce it's so thick the bottom layer can burn let's turn the heat all the way down we just need a bare simmer anyway green beans in parallel alignment and I will cut them into chunks at an extreme angle makes them look a little prettier I'm doing a whole pound of green beans 454 grams some classic casseroles are based on green beans instead of noodles I'm basically doing half noodles half green beans which should result in a nutritionally superior product for me those need a little head start to a little pre-cooking so I'll stir them in and let them simmer that sauce looks way too thick now but tons of water is going to come out of the vegetables I've got this mostly sweet red pepper from the garden I'll cut that in half take the seeds out and slice it into strips you could use a regular bell pepper instead in those go and you could use a second bell pepper as Martha does but I'm using a handful of red chilies I think these are Fresnos which are not very hot but if you want to control the heat somewhat more one thing you can do is slice them into rounds pick them up and then just push out the seeds and the ribs where most of the heat is you'll only have to do the that with the slices from up near the stem the other rounds will be empty gather those up and then you can kind of shake out some more seeds throw those in stir in the peppers so they can get a little head start on softening I'll get rid of all those seeds now I've got a couple of Bunches of green onions here but any form of onion will work as long as you slice it thin I'll peel off any tattered or slimy outer layers some of these are noticeably Sandy on the inside that'll happen they grew up through dirt yet another reason to peel off those outer layers I'll give those one more rinse in the sink okay cut the roots off and discard then slice thin all the way up through the whites and into the greens I'll just stop when I get to the very top where they're super dry and stringy all those go in stir stir make sure the sauce at the bottom isn't burning here's a great trick that I do owe to Martha canned marinated artichokes usually they're baby artichokes which is why you can eat the whole thing not just the heart these bring a ton of flavor to a casserole if you can get the lid off I'm embarrassing myself oh you know our friends at the national Center for home food preservation gave me one of these thingies for gripping Lids nice Martha says to drain the marinade off I see no reason to not just dump it all in there now it's tuna time I've got four of these standard five ounce cans 140 grams each and this is one of the brands that's generally recommended by the folks at seafoodwatch.org they also recommend looking for cans that say pole and lime cot there's lots of terrible sustainability issues associated with tuna and seafood watch has a great guide for canned tuna it's linked in the description I'll dump all of these in again I see no reason to drain them we need liquid we need flavor put it all in if you don't eat fish maybe some jars of marinated mushrooms instead once the tuna is in you don't want to over stir because you could end up shredding the meat too fine I'll put in some seasonings before I stir again a ton of garlic powder makes a casserole really taste like something a little less onion powder a little dried thyme or other herb maybe some mustard powder grind in a lot of black pepper and then a big pinch of salt to start with we'll probably need more but the tuna is salty the artichokes are salty so it's good to be conservative give that an initial stirring and now it's time for 12 ounces 340 grams of dried egg noodles manischevitz is the best hashtag not an ad and lots of people pre-boil them but you can just dump them right in I'll stir them in we've got some excessively large chunks of tuna still but they will keep breaking apart as we stir here's the trick to making baked noodle dishes without pre-boiling get it so that the texture looks right except for the fact that the noodles are dry this is about the sauce texture that I want in the end get everything tossed in enough thick sauce and then top it off with enough wine or stock or plain water to just cover all of that will get absorbed by the noodles yes I'm doing a whole bottle of cheap Pinot Grigio you could use half Wine Half water if you want it less acidic you could use all water but with a big glug or two 2 of white balsamic vinegar to replicate the taste of wine without the alcohol just get enough watery liquid in there to barely cover I need a little more so a little water stir stir now I'll get a spoonful of that liquid and taste for seasoning tastes pretty good by itself but it's going to need more salt a lot more because all of the flavor is going to be diluted by the noodles and the other Bland bulk in there the sauce should taste too salty at this stage a little too salty push all those noodles down so they get cooked and lastly you can grate on any hard cheese if you want this is pecorino this will Brown nicely in the last phase of cooking and that's it cover tightly with foil to trap Steam and get all the noodles cooked Bake at 400 degrees Fahrenheit 200 Celsius until the noodles are soft and it seems like most of the water is absorbed it'll be 45 minutes an hour max then throw it back in uncovered to evaporate any remaining free water and to let the top get all brown and crunchy another other 20 minutes or so yeah it takes a long time to bake especially if you don't boil the noodles first but you can bake it the night before and just reheat it when you get home from work or you can kind of under bake it a little bit and then freeze it there's a reason everybody brings casseroles to people who are sick or they just had a baby or something casseroles tend to taste even better after they've been reheated a meal as simple and all inclusive as Squarespace the sponsor of this video

***RECIPE, SERVES 4-6***

3lb (1.36kg) mock tenderloi...",29:02.6, this one goes out to the Irish guy who got really angry about the tomato-based pot roast that I cooked one time he insisted that pot roast has plain brown gravy and well that sounds good to me today the trick is how to make the gravy taste like something we'll get there but first the meat today I want sliceable pot roast rather than one that you break up into chunks and to get the best slices which you want to look for is an oblong piece of meat meaning the muscle fibers run side to side instead of up and down we will slice across the fibers there's lots of cuts from the animals hindquarters that people use for a sliceable pot roast but this is from the shoulder it's called the mock tenderloin because it kind of looks like a tenderloin but it's not it's one of the rotator cuff muscles much more intramuscular fat and better flavor than any kind of round roast it is super chewy but that's why we braise it for half a day just to save on dirty dishes I'm oiling this up right in the cold pan ton of pepper a few big pinches of salt and then I'll just smoosh everything around to get the roast coated then I'll I'll turn on the heat to Brown it for a steak or something small you really have to get the pan hot before you put the meat in otherwise the inside will be overdone by the time the outside is brown but this is a big thick roast so it's going to be fine while that's heating up I'll peel and dice a few shallots not necessary but they'll help the gravy taste like something and if I cut them small they're pretty much just going to dissolve into the sauce over the long braise let's see how the meat is doing gonna need more color than that but I really advise going easy I'll actually turn the heat down a bit you can brown or roast really slowly and it comes out just as good if you're too aggressive with your heat you end up scorching the pan like that when that dissolves into the sauce it's going to make everything taste burned especially in a plainly flavored dish like this you can grab like a wet paper towel with some tongs and rub it off just deglaze that one bad spot of the pan while you leave all the good Brown fond intact my heat is like medium and I'm just going to go nice and slow Browning all the surfaces a bit and if if the Brown is on the bottom of the pan or on the meat itself it doesn't really matter everything is going to dissolve together in the braise you just need some Browning somewhere to create a base of flavor and honestly that's enough people think you got to get maximum Browning on every square millimeter but you hit a point of diminishing returns where you mostly just risk creating burned flavors that's good enough I'll throw my shallots in and let them fry for a couple of minutes until Brown and I swear this will not be a tomatoey pot roast you will not perceive a little squeeze of tomato paste as being tomatoey especially if you brown it a little just goes a really long way toward intensifying the taste of a gravy once that's browned it's time to deglaze and sure I'll use a carton of beef stock because I have one but it really doesn't make a huge difference you could just use water you know what I need I need my broad wooden spoon the queen of all cooking utensils use that to scrape all the brown stuff off the bottom if you look at those instant brown gravy packets they sell the ingredients are mostly just garlic powder onion powder Maybe some powder a dry mushroom or yeast extract for Umami but if you don't have that you can just use some soy sauce and then some assorted dry herbs also those packets have starch for thickening but we'll do that later reduce the heat to a simmer cover so that the exposed meat steams you could transfer this to the oven I would do 275 Fahrenheit 135 Celsius but I'm going to do it all on the stove today this will take hours to soften it's an easy meal but not a quick one if you need something

sorry I steamed you if I poke at the meat a little I can tell that it's starting to soften but it's gonna need like another two hours until it's really tender when I think I'm an hour hour and a half away I will start leisurely working on my vegetables carrots will take the longest to cook so those first I think I'll do big hearty chunks today skinny ones can be whole pieces fat ones I'll cut in half lengthwise honestly you could have the carrots in from the beginning overcooked carrots are still pretty good overcooked potatoes are not in a stew they fall apart and they make the gravy all gritty it helps to use waxy potatoes but I would not put these in until the meat is pretty close to being done when in doubt wait because you could always take the meat out and hold it while the vegetables catch up I've got some celery that I'll cut into big hearty chunks and the last thing I'll put in is some big chunks of green onion I love these in stews but I would only cook these for like a 20 minutes max I'll chop up the greens and save them for garnish roast has been simmering for almost five hours and when I push on it I can feel the meat fibers pulling apart I actually think I overcooked this a bit if you want to be able to slice your Meats you've got to stop braising just before it gets fall apart tender I will take that out give the veggies another few minutes until they're almost fork tender remember they're going to keep softening even after after you take them out I'm taking everything out with a slotted spoon and transferring it to a heat safe platter that I could hold in a warm oven until it's time to eat time to finish the gravy sometimes I thicken at the beginning so that I don't have to pull all the food out but the advantage of doing it at the end is you don't have to guess how much thickener you're going to need it's not necessary but I think one of the easiest ways to sex up a gravy is to throw in a packet or two of powdered gelatin you can scatter that right onto the sauce but it's safer to disperse it in a little cool water first to avoid clumps it just needs to sit for a few minutes and Bloom thicken you'll see it happening stir that into the sauce and it won't do much to thicken at least not at such a low concentration but it will give the sauce a really sticky glossy finish that I associate with good French cooking even though this is ostensibly Irish I'm really just trolling that Irish guy today for my main thickener I'm using a cornstarch slurry but you could use any starch or flour just disperse it in a small amount of cool water cool so the starch doesn't gelatinize is prematurely and Clump speaking of which you gotta drizzle really slowly and stir vigorously as you do this or else you're going to get little ropes of starch in your stew that looks like enough for now let's taste that plain brown gravy and it's not bad it's a little Bland needs acid and pungency and a great way to get both is with some mustard any tart mustard that's a great way to elevate a plain gravy while not turning it into a curry or something it still tastes Northwestern European in that way that is Bland at worst but clear and clean at best no one will know if you summon forth the upside down bear they'll just know that the gravy tastes better a little sugar or honey just enhances everything else adjust seasoning and all of that remember that the gravy is going to thicken more as it cools to eating temperature so yeah we're done time to slice our beef against the grain yeah see I overshot the mark and now it's shredding a bit as I slice it's fine obviously gonna look great once it's covered in gravy and there's certainly no shortage of gravy really satisfying and comfy that is fall came all at once this year in East Tennessee and in that context this is really hitting the spot
Pastina — tiny pasta porridge,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NNvyKMp3JAY/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLB-3Gp8HuKTpzY07ppxzmXZPREW_g,NNvyKMp3JAY,"8 minutes, 23 seconds",Thanks to Fetch Rewards for sponsoring this video!

more broadly it refers to a way of cooking said Tiny shapes that's very different from other Italian pasta dishes you can cook these more like rice than like pasta meaning you only use a little bit of boil water and you don't drain it off at the end the result is a porridge of pasta like couscous but generally a lot creamier than couscous it's more like risotto you can put vegetables and all kinds of stuff in with the pasta but first let me show you the basic this is apparently a thing that a lot of Italians grow up eating when they are sick the shape is a tiny star but it could be letter pasta anything very small for liquid you could use plain water some people use milk I think I like chicken stock the best for this but obviously you could use veggie stock and the ratio that I like is four to one liquid to pasta by weight or three to one by volume at least with this particular pasta shape other shapes will measure differently by volume I'm just doing one portion so I've got a cup and a half of stock that's 355 mils I'm throwing a leaf from my sage plant in there just to infuse the stock a little but you could use any herb dry or fresh bring that to a boil and then I'll stir in about 90 grams of this dry pastina which is half a cup three to one by volume four to one by weight and it'll seem like not nearly enough pasta at first but give it a few minutes stirring frequently so that nothing sticks to the sides of the pan when you cook pasta normally in a large excess of water you don't really have to worry about sticking but you do here like five minutes later we're almost there I'll fish out the sage leaf before things get way too sticky the key is to stop cooking and mix in all your other ingredients a little before the pasta is done and all the water is absorbed heat is off bubbling has about stopped and I'll melt in a knob of butter I've seen people put this in earlier but that breaks the natural Emulsion of the butter if we melt it in gently at the very end it'll stay creamier a couple of grinds of pepper in something this subtly flavored you'll really notice the fresh pepper so go easier than you normally would grate in some Parmesan or pecorino cheese we're finishing this just like risotto stir it in and taste for seasoning you might not need any additional salt given the salty cheese and the store-bought stock is salty you could call that done or you could stir in an egg if I was making two portions I would use a whole egg but I'm only making one portion so I'm just using the yolk that'll be more luxurious anyway the key is to wait until the bubbling has totally stopped and then stir really vigorously or else the egg is going to curdle and you're going to get ugly ribbons of cooked eggs streaking through I've got one little streak right there but otherwise I have kept the egg creamy not curdled and over the two minutes in which I've been finishing this dish the pasta has finished cooking and absorbed the last of the free liquid in there if you want it soupier you can always add liquid at this stage but I think the ratio I gave you is a good starting point you can always add liquid you can't take it away kind of looks like cave VR right and it feels a little like caviar in the mouth smooth little pearls you can grate on more cheese maybe give it a swirl of olive oil on top for some heterogeneity and that is some comfort food right there it's like a cross between oatmeal and mac and cheese but with the Finesse of a good risotto in a fraction of the time that it takes to make risotto let's try it again but make a nutritionally complete meal out of it I'm making four portions and I'm starting with about a quart or a liter of water that's conservative but we can always add get that coming to a boil and instead of using a meat stock this time I'm going to use a handful of dried mushrooms morels are expensive you could totally use something way cheaper any really fragrant dried mushroom will give you a meaty

minute Head Start I can start putting in other stuff like a handful of these Frozen fresh lima beans I love those but they need like 15 or 20 minutes to cook they're not like frozen peas which cook instantly small vegetables that you can buy just one of at the grocery store my favorite kind the carrot will take the longest to soften so I'll cut it first hand above and around the knife stabilizing it while I cut it lengthwise now I can lay these securely on their flat faces and cut them into quarters and then I can slice crosswise and those should cook pretty quick into the broth they go the mushrooms will need like a half hour total to soften and they've been going about 15 minutes so we are right on track next I'll chop up this shallot any form of onion is fine and I'll peel and chop a couple of garlic cloves in with all of that looks like we've had some evaporation need more water so let's borrow a page from risotto technique and throw in a glass of white wine not necessary but very nice with the celery I'll save those leaves for garnish at the end cut this into little sticks and then cut across the sticks in those go the quickest cooking veg is going to be the zucchini I'll cut that in half lay those securely on their flat size and then I'll think I'll need to quarter each of these to get sufficiently small pieces so cut those into eight sticks cut across the sticks and those little pieces will need I don't know 10 minutes max and we're there so in they go I suppose I should throw in a pinch of salt to start with given that we're not starting with a salty store-bought stock a few grinds of pepper and now we'll just simmer the veggies until they're almost perfectly tender which turned out to be seven more minutes time to stir in one cup of dry pastina about 180 grams this is going to seem like not nearly enough for four portions but I'm trying to make a healthier meal here so I want the mass to be like half vegetables at least plus check how much the pasta expands give it a stir now and then so that nothing sticks and all the pasta Cooks evenly like five minutes later here's how much liquid we've absorbed we're probably going to need to add some more but that's fine you can always add heat off and I'll melt in a giant knob of butter this is four portions great in a big pile of cheese and only because I have one lying around I'll grate in some lemon zest I really like how the zest freshens up a stewed vegetable dish and you can still use the juice in something else another day a handful of frozen peas mostly for color all they have to do is thaw and maybe some chili flakes just for fun get all that melted in definitely going to need some more water but that's fine the bubbling has fully stopped but the pot is still steaming so it's the perfect time to stir in eggs I'm doing two whole eggs for four portions stir vigorously and the eggs should not scramble they'll just go nice and creamy taste for seasoning needs more salt but I think I'll take my salt in the form of more cheese oh and my celery leaves for garnish stir that in and we are done you could use vegan sour cream in place of the butter and cheese and you could skip the eggs entirely but I really like how their texture interacts with the little pasta shapes it's really quite a luxurious silky texture plus we've got a nutritionally respectable meal here lots of veg a little protein it's good and again far quicker and easier than making risotto use a bag of frozen vegetable medley instead of the fresh veg and you've got dinner in like 10 minutes just don't tell your Nona about it or do tell your Nona about it she respects efficiency
German-style soft pretzels — no lye,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/niv6mtzkW3Q/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLAZI7byPn7UePi0YAdxfwYOgWj2Fg,niv6mtzkW3Q,"9 minutes, 30 seconds",Thanks to Helix Sleep for sponsoring this video!

Free shipping within the US! #helixsle...,29:02.6, yes real german-style soft pretzels are boiled or dipped in lye before they are baked lye sodium hydroxide problem is food grade lye is hard to find and it's legit dangerous to work with you get chemical burns these pretzels I boiled in the next best thing which is sodium carbonate Washing Soda which you can make very easily at home from plain old baking soda I'll show you dough first any dough is fine but this is mine a cup of water 237 mils teaspoon of yeast tablespoon of sugar a tablespoon or two of melted butter or oil purists may get upset about the fat and the sugar but I was raised on Mall pretzels and I refuse to be sorry for who I am a teaspoon of this kosher salt that's not very much but you want the dough to be under seasoned because you're gonna have the salt on top highly optional but I've been using a teaspoon of baking powder in addition to the yeast just for some extra poof in the oven I've seen a few German recipes call for that now I will just stir in as much bread flour as I can stir in with a spoon I increasingly start all of my breads this way it keeps your hands clean for the messiest parts of bread making no more pulling little dried sticky bits out of the hairs on your fingers that's about as much as I can get in I'll cover it with a wet towel and let it autoize for about 20 minutes before proceeding meanwhile baking soda standard sodium bicarbonate just dump a bunch of it into a dry pan and turn the heat on high it's time to boil the water out yes there's water in there see how it starts to Clump as it Heats sodium bicarbonate is not actually sodium bicarbonate that's an old scientific misnomer that just stuck baking soda is actually sodium hydrogen carbonate and when you get it hot the hydrogen and oxygen form water and literally boil off along with some carbon dioxide want to see just wait until it gets really hot and then shake the pan pretty cool huh Harold McGee famously suggested doing this for pretzels some years back and he tells you to bake your baking soda in the oven for an hour at least but it only takes 15 minutes on the stove it's super fun to watch and you can monitor the process better if you overcook this it could start to break down into some less desirable compounds you'll know exactly when it's done whenever you stop seeing little gas geysers you shake the pan or stir it and there's no visible signs of gas anymore when that happens you're done and you can check by weighing it if you really converted your baking soda into Washing Soda then it should weigh a little less than two-thirds of its original weight I started with one pound 454 grams and nailed it let that cool and try not to let it sit on your skin or get in your eyes or anything it's mildly caustic after 20 minutes this dough has autolized it's super stretchy and quite easy to knead now I'll just knead in some more flour pretzel dough is generally on the dry side the dough should be a little tacky but not super sticky that's probably a little too sticky a little more flour there we go just barely sticky I'll cover that up and let it rise until it's soft and fluffy as my

your Helix Sleep mattress plus two free pillows Helix sleep.com slash regusia thank you Helix anyway risen dough comes out and I will cut it into quarters I'm making four large pretzels today and I'm borrowing a trick from French baguette technique no idea if Germans do this with pretzels but flatten the quarter out into a triangle grab the point of the triangle and roll inward to give you a little loaf with tapered ends when it comes time to actually shape the pretzels we'll be halfway there already cover and let rise again at least 20 or 30 minutes that's enough time for the gluten to relax every time you work a dough like this the gluten tenses up you gotta wait until it's pliable again to shape out the pretzels and I'm still working on this move but the basic idea is you only roll the outer ends I'm trying for a shape that's more swabian than Bavarian the swabian pretzels have thin little arms and fat bellies which means each pretzel has a thick fluffy part and thin crispy Parts heterogeneity you roll the ends and leave the belly in the center alone get the Rope a lot longer than you think you want it because it's going to snap back plus the whole thing is going to puff up a lot so the negative spaces are going to fill in make a U twist the ends fold them over done now I'll let those proof for another half hour after which time they'll be nice and puffy and if you want to make your life really easy here's another non-traditional tip throw them in the freezer not until they're rock hard but until they're firm enough to not fall apart during the boiling phase speaking of which a wide deep pan of water for boiling and a wide deep bowl of water for rinsing heat on high and into the pan goes as much of my water Washing Soda as I can easily dissolve the solution does not have to be fully saturated yes pet ants I know fully saturated is technically redundant you don't want any undissolved calcium carbonate grains hanging out in there because they could stick to the pretzel and they would taste bitter you should see the water go clear after a couple of minutes of stirring and here's why we cooked our baking soda the solution has a pH of 11. that's less than the 13 you'd get with lye but way more than the eight you'd get with regular old baking soda all this extra washing soda I can seal up tight in a non-reactive container and save it's great for making pretzels and for making pretzels the water does not have to be at a rolling boil just real hot here's my nice firm pretzel easy to work with and in the bath it goes the alkalinity and the heat alter the surface of the pretzel such that the mayard reaction will proceed much faster in the oven the pretzel will Brown before the inside is overcooked and dry it'll also get you that smooth shiny surface that defines a pretzel all to me now here's a step that you don't have to do if you use lie you got to rinse the pretzel in fresh water lye breaks down in the oven and you don't taste it but the washing soda would taste bitter if you left it on the surface I'll sprinkle on my salt right now while the pretzel is still wet the moisture is what makes the salt stick some Germans use big chunky salt some use fine salts use whatever you want next one in this is so much easier when the pretzels are really cold I highly recommend that I get cosmetically better results when I boil these for like 10-15 seconds Max any longer and they wrinkle up a lot more they start to fall apart no good wash off that washing soda The Washing Soda solution is mildly caustic but it's not like a lye bath if you get this on your skin it might feel kind of warm you'd probably want to wash it off pretty soon but it's not an instant chemical burn not even close salt on more salt than looks correct because remember the pretzel is going to grow in the oven now when people use lye they often don't even bother heating the water it's just a lukewarm bath that's because the LIE is much stronger and they can leave it on the surface because it breaks down in the oven we need the extra boost of heat to get a similar level of Browning some people also brush on egg wash onto the pretzel just for some extra Browning help I tried that and I got no noticeable benefit it would help if you were just boiling these in baking soda but the washing soda just does a better job and the egg is unnecessary last step is another swabian trick slash the belly score the fat belly of the pretzel so it's free to puff up more in the oven its growth won't be restricted by tight outer skin into a fully preheated oven 425 Fahrenheit 220c at least you can go higher if you want them even darker and crispier here we are like 15 minutes later and they're beautiful just pull them whenever they're brown to your liking no we don't have the dark mahogany crust you get from lye but we also don't have chemical burns all over our hands here's one final trick spray or brush on some water while the pretzels are still really hot the water will set into a glaze and you'll get a shinier look you could even do that one or two times during the baking process for an even more dramatic effect alright I suppose it's a middle ground between a Bavarian and a swabian pretzel inside it's super fluffy and Rich thanks to the butter and sugar one day we'll make a straight up Mall pretzel video I promise if the outer crust is a little too firm for you just know that they'll soften a bit as they sit around and water from the inside migrates out to the crust but I sure like them straight out of the oven

***RECIPE***

1 stick (113g) cold butter
1/2 stick (106g) melted butter
1 3/4 cup...",29:02.6, I'm going to he double hockey sticks for this one but I made a crust pie it's pastry crust on the bottom with graham cracker crust on top and Oreo crumb crust in the middle it's three pie crusts stacked on top of each other with a sweet binder between them I will surrender myself to the authorities but first here's the recipe standard short crust pastry a stick of cold butter 113 grams that's one part by weight now two parts dry ingredients by weight almost entirely flower normal all-purpose flour and then like a spoonful or two of sugar we have plenty more sweetness coming a pinch or two of salt if you're using unsalted butter and then I'll just hack at it you can do this with a food processor you can do it with a pastry cutter but you can also just smack it around with a knife keep cutting the butter until it almost disappears in there I'll make a little well and then start working in just enough cold water to bring this together into a Shaggy dough the reason everything needs to be cold is you don't want to melt the butter if the butter melts you get a totally homogeneous text texture that isn't crumbly or flaky or anything like that it should look like you didn't use quite enough water throw that in the fridge for a half hour let all the particles hydrate and we should be perfect Meanwhile my binder that'll go between the crusts dark corn syrup you could use golden syrup or honey the dark syrup has a nice caramel flavor half a cup 150 grams or so and then another half a cup of plain granulated sugar 100 grams the mixture of crystallized sucrose with other syrups gets you a thick yet soft texture at least when baked with eggs two eggs a good splash of vanilla stir smooth this is basically pecan pie filling it's missing butter but we're gonna have plenty of butter elsewhere speaking of which half a stick like 60 grams of butter melted we'll need that to bind our crumb crust starting with Oreos one of these big sleeves which is one two three four 16 Oreos or they're abouts maybe 200 grams Max in a bag and then Hulk smash you can do this in a food processor but Hulk smash this is just my rolling pin by the way a blunt instrument for an imprecise job when I need a Precision instrument I turn to Harry's sponsor of this video I use fine German steel in the kitchen and when I shave yes I still shave a little oh check out the new two-tone handle design with deeper grooves for better grip half of that plastic is recycled by the way love the shave gel with the aloe it feels great and there's no obnoxious smell now for some Precision beard maintenance the flex hinge will help me negotiate these Corners the thing about my beard is it grows really slowly and when there's not much there for a bad razor to grab onto you just get terrible skin irritation I dealt with that my whole life until I found Harry's their five blade razors are just sharper they can handle anything from peach fuzz on up Harry's manufactures these blades in their own Factory in Germany and the refills are shockingly affordable you can get a hairy Starter Set like mine here for just three dollars with my link harrys.com Adam after that you can get razor refills delivered right to your door just three bucks for a set with a razor weighted handle and shave gel harrys.com Adam thank you Harry's anyway I'll put maybe a third of this butter in with the cookie crumbs and then toss like you do for any crumb crust you want just enough butter so that it doesn't immediately crumble when you clench it like that that's good enough done a little flour on the counter and we can roll out our chilled rested pastry dough it's always hardest at the beginning just give it a few rolls turn and repeat turning helps you roll more evenly and it keeps the bottom of the pastry from sticking to the counter very gradually it'll start to flatten out without cracking but if it cracks a little that's fine the harder a short crust pastry is to work the better it's going to taste the heterogeneous distribution of butter creates fault lines that'll crumble in your mouth doesn't have to be super thin what is that like half a centimeter wide enough to cover my pie pan Which I'll grease up with my butter over here that'll make the pie really easy to get out later lay the pastry in go around the edge breaking off any excess and being sure to patch any holes holes would let that corn syrup mixture seep through to the pan surface where it would burn or stick pour in a thin layer of said mixture it just tastes great and it binds all the layers together Oreo crumb layer in and then I'll compress it a little like I would for any crumb crust just don't schmoosh the pastry underneath now to minimize both color pollution and waste I'll turn this bag inside out and throw in two of these packages of graham crackers about 250 grams smashy smash that chocolate is on the outside of the bag so my colors are staying separate the rest of my melted butter goes in with a pinch of salt if it's unsalted butter and you could throw in some cinnamon if you want it's actually good if it seems like you don't have quite enough butter to bind this into a crust too much butter and it'll be too solid once baked give that syrup and egg mixture another stir it separates as it sits then pour in another layer on top of the chocolate followed by all of the gram cracker crumbs again I'll Pat that flat and then pour over my remaining syrup this will make the top all shiny cover in aluminum foil that'll trap heat and get you even cooking across all those layers and bake at 350 Fahrenheit 180c we'll check back in on it in 45 minutes which is now time to remove the foil and bake it again how long depends on your oven and the dimensions of the pan this is a narrow deep pan which means it's going to take a little bit of extra time see how the center Jiggles in there bake this until everything is brown and that jiggling pretty much stops which was another 45 minutes for me if you want a gooey texture bake it a little less I like it super chewy let it cool for a bit and then it's solid enough that you can just turn it out like that slice carefully because that pastry is super crumbly as it should be and there you go there's your slice if you're less of a crust person than I am you can moisten things up with some whipped cream on top Super chewy not that easy to cut through with a fork oh yeah he double hockey sticks it's like a a giant chewy chocolate Golden Graham you know it's solid enough that you can just pick up the piece and that's the way to do it do it in moderation

anything like that the secret is in how you heat the potatoes i'm going to show you the way that i would do it which is very simple then i'm going to show you the way the molecular gastronomy crowd usually does it which is a more involved process that yields a product i have mixed feelings about but first my way this method works with any kind of potatoes but here in north america we have these incredible yukon gold potatoes these are halfway between a waxy potato and a flowery potato and they have thin smooth skins that taste good so i do not peel them but when i don't use yukon golds for mash i try to use a combination of waxy and flowery potatoes but again any potato works with this method it does help to cut the potato into smaller chunks than you might normally use for mash this method uses very low heat so it takes longer and you can speed things up a little by increasing the surface area some people do slices for this instead of smaller chunks slices would work too throw those into a pot and this doesn't make a huge difference but you can wash the cut potatoes a little bit one thing that gives bad mash the properties of glue is free starch starch that has fallen out of the individual potato cells when we cut up the potatoes we ruptured some cells and some starch leaked out you can wash it off but according to my experiments this does not make a huge difference finally i'll fill the pot with water just to the very top of the potatoes i like to use the cooking water in the final dish and keeping the water to a minimum concentrates potato flavor in there but that's also not essential to this method another thing not essential but good anyway is garlic i'm just peeling a few cloves of garlic and then throwing them in to boil with the potatoes this is an extremely convenient way of getting garlic flavor into your mash and the resulting garlic flavor is surprisingly smooth and mild it's good especially if you're someone who doesn't like really bossy garlic now here's the trick turn the heat on low cover and bring the pot to a temperature below a simmer there might be some static foam on top but there should be no active bubbling at all at least not for the first 10 or 20 minutes the target temperature range is somewhere between 50 and 80 degrees celsius 122 to 176 fahrenheit pre-cooking or blanching the potatoes at sub-simmering temperatures this is the trick i'm on a gas stove which can't hold super low temperatures so after 20 minutes the heat just naturally builds up to an actual simmer and that's fine the first phase of cooking gelatinized the starch this second phase of cooking dissolves pectin and other bonds holding the potato together makes it soft enough to mash you need a hotter second cooking phase to soften up the potatoes but it still works better if you do it at a simmer rather than a full boil these took an hour total to get super fork tender indicating they are ready to smash this is just my little trick i'm catching some of the boil water in a glass my experiments indicate that water has more flavor than the milk you normally mix into mash but it's not a huge difference my favorite greenery to put in mash is green onions very thinly sliced but you could skip this or you could use a fresh herb sage is really nice in mash butter as much as you can justify to yourself i'll let that melt for a sec my heat is still on low i want to keep the mash hot enough to cook the onions a little bit a pinch of salt i've found zero advantage to salting the boil water if you salt at the end you can do it to taste pepper to taste sometimes i mash my mash with a masher but i generally prefer to actually whip it with electric beaters my mom did it this way and if you do that low temperature blanching step you really can get away with brutalizing the mash it won't be very gluey or pasty no matter what you do to it it'll just be smooth the boiled garlic cloves in there mash up totally smooth as well by the way a little of my cooking water to loosen the texture you could use milk instead onions in toward the end so they don't overcook before i actually eat give that a little taste needs a hair more salt and if you want some extra dairy flavor you can stir in powdered milk at the end it's that simple this gives you more dairy flavor than you'd get from normal milk plus we have the extra potato flavor from the boil water it's the best of all worlds alrighty that's my mash this is basically how i plan to make mash going forward incredibly smooth creamy not sticky texture at all but the next thing i'll show you is the more elaborate procedure that results in an even more dramatic effect i first learned about it from the noted molecular gastronomist heston blumenthal whose biography i have been listening to on audible sponsor of this video for blumenthal being a cook was not an ambition that he forged particularly early in life instead he originally wanted to be an inventor audible is

in the description thank you audible okay so these potatoes with garlic i've blanched just as before nothing different about 20 minutes at sub simmering temperatures the ideal range is apparently between 50 and 70 c drain save the boil water if you want to and then here's the extra step cool them down the fastest way to do that is with cool water i'll just let that sit and continuously overflow for a minute and i can feel when we've got most of the heat out of there drain thoroughly and then i'll throw that in the fridge for at least a half hour enough time to allow some starch retrogradation the science behind why this two-step cooking process works is very complex and it's not fully understood i've linked an old literature review on this topic in the description if you want to read more the mechanisms at play are multiple but the effect seems to be starch that stays bottled up inside the individual potato cells rather than starch that spills out into the mash this second cooking we do at an actual simmer this is mostly to dissolve the bonds between the cells so that they all fall apart from each other the effect works with or without the cooling step in the middle but it is enhanced by the cooling step in the middle because science again we don't fully know why ready to mash butter in a bowl this time because i'm going to use one of these things a ricer i prefer the beaters but this is a more gentle way to mash gets us a less homogeneous product there's one of those beautiful soft garlic cloves press the hot potatoes over the butter and the butter will melt it's called a ricer because stuff comes out of it looking a little like grains of rice i guess the one thing is that it acts like a filter and does not allow the skins through which could be a bonus in your book i used a heat-safe bowl so that i can keep them over a flame i want some heat in there to slightly cook the green onions mash with green onions is known in ireland as champ possibly from an old scottish verb meaning to crush nobody knows but is real good pinch of salt a splash of my reserved boil water or milk if you want pepper people who care about aesthetics more than i do use white pepper and again this is pure bonus but some powdered milk you can put in a lot more than that it hardly affects the texture at all it just gets to a point where it's a little too sweet for me and now i'm just gently stirring that with a spoon because i went through all the work of using the ricer the ricer is about leaving the texture a little heterogeneous and also not bursting the individual potato cells though the blanching and cooling steps have made that very unlikely the starch is all locked up in individual cells which is why this isn't gluey or pasty at all to a fault in my book i actually think this version with the cooling step i think this is too smooth and soft to me it's reminiscent of instant mash made from those dehydrated potato flakes hardly surprising because those manufacturers use the same basic blanching and cooling process i also notice a slightly less enjoyable taste my hypothesis is that when all of the starch is bound up in the cells less of it comes into contact with enzymes in your saliva that break the starch down into simpler sugars that you can taste before you swallow that's just a guess on my part but one thing i think enhances the flavor of any mash is a raw egg yolk on top ideally you do this when the mash is still steaming hot and then the yolk cooks slightly as you stir it in crazy delicious though obviously it comes with some health risk as all runny eggs do make your mash however you want but try this basic technique hold the potatoes at sub-simmering temperature for a while before you do anything else and you will be amazed by the difference

***RECIPE***

For the dip

6-7 lbs (3 kilos) fresh eggplants
1-2...",29:02.6, it's no secret i'm not the biggest fan of eggplant but they know how to treat it in the levant destroy it with fire baba ganoush is not pretty but it is creamy smoky and delicious grill some flat bread with it and you've got a crowd-pleasing meatless meal that you can do outside this is not quite the traditional west asian pita bread i want something crispier to use for dipping here's the dough three quarters of a cup of water 175 mils a teaspoon of sugar teaspoon of yeast teaspoon of salt and i'm doing a quarter cup of plain yogurt a big spoonful if you don't do dairy just replace that with more water and i'm doing some cornmeal maybe half a cup 60 grams this will give the bread great flavor and a texture that's much more cracker like the rest will just be normal bread flour as much as i can stir in which will probably end up being like two cups max 140 grams or so i'll just leave that covered to hydrate and auto lyse and all of that for about 20 minutes time now to knead which is not really about developing gluten the otolice pretty much did that it's really about jamming as much flour in here as it'll take flatbreads like this are generally a pretty dry stiff dough that's what makes them hold up so well on a grill or in a tandoor a wet dough would just droop through the bars or fall off and don't freak out if the dough seems rough like that that's the yogurt the acid and yogurt messes with the gluten a bit but it tastes real good that's taken all the flour it's gonna take time to let it rise for an hour or two when it's real puffy i'll divide it into maybe six little balls roll those out smooth and let them proof for about a half hour a second rise improves flavor and texture and makes them much easier to roll out flat i've got some parchment papers that i'm going to cut in half you'll see why a little flour on top and just roll it basically as thin as i reasonably can then plop it on the parchment sheet and repeat splatty and wiggle it here's another thing you can do if you want just dock the bread with a fork this will get you lots of little bubbles instead of one big bubble like a pocket pita thanks to the paper i've got a compact stack that i can just throw in the fridge until i'm ready to grill if they're cold they'll be easier to handle time to start a fire you could certainly do this meal on a gas grill or in a very hot oven ideally under the broiler but charcoal is definitely the best it's going to get us some smoky flavor and probably the highest heat you can easily generate at home my lit coals go down and then i'm going to cover them with lots more unlit coals i need enough fuel to roast the eggplant for a long time and then to bake the bread great on top and then you need so many eggplants to make just one little bowl of baba ganoush i've got five big ones and i could have used more i'd say get yourself six or seven pounds three kilos raw eggplant to feed like four people as the main dish i think it's better to cover the grill my air vents are wide open but the lid will restrict oxygen flow to the fire and keep the eggplant skin from burning right off before the inside is cooked through better stay nearby just for safety and to keep my identity safe i'm using ara sponsor of this video there's a new identity theft victim every 14 seconds here in the states so here's a funny thing about being me on the internet sometimes young people will contact me and they'll say hey did you realize that this private information about you is out there on the internet you better get that taken down there's lots of crazy people out there and it's like legally public information so the journalism professor in me wants to be like you're a young person let me tell you about all of your rights under open

family members ara.com adam thank you ara okay every now and then you might just flip these around shuffle their positions because the fire probably is not even i should have pierced these with a knife before we started and you're about to see why yeah that one just exploded from internal steam pressure that's not a problem for the eggplant but it is a problem if you happen to be standing nearby you'll get burnt another reason to keep the lid on while i'm waiting i can get the other ingredients ready to me baba ganoush is chiefly a garlic delivery system some people would think this is an obscene amount given that it's going to be pretty much raw in the final dish but i'm a fan of mild obscenity people often grate this to get it really fine i think grating garlic is usually a pain i'm just gonna grind it down with some salt pretty smooth paste that is you can also dip vegetables in baba ganoush like cucumber very delicious and probably a lot healthier you might need to replenish your fuel which is easy enough to do if you have tongs the name of the game here is to just completely destroy the eggplant just incinerate it you gotta break down that inner flesh until it's really dark and creamy and dry we gotta get out most of the water that's looking pretty good in there after like 45 minutes i'm gonna leave the lid off now so that the fire can get a ton of oxygen and literally burn the skins to a crisp if they're crispy the eggplant will be firmer easier to pick up and easier to scoop out nice and smoky and crispy done i'll put the lid back on to keep the remaining fuel from burning too fast we need it for the bread pop them open with the knife and let them steam out for a few minutes and then you can just go in with a spoon and scoop out the flesh i think this is way easier than trying to peel the skin off the flesh which i've seen people do it's no big deal if you get a few little bits of burned skin in there they'll actually taste quite nice it's just probably not the healthiest thing to put in your body so minimize burnt skin and you'll note that i have scooped all of this into a tea towel because now i'm just going to ball it up and give it a squeeze and feed the plants with that excess juice you don't have to get the pulp bone dry but do what you can you can do this in a salad spinner instead okay that looks pretty disgusting but it's gonna get better i'll cut my lemon in half and chop up some cilantro but you could use parsley i'll start with just half of that lemon juice and maybe half of my garlic a big pinch of salt and give that a preliminary stir time to start adding the fatty ingredients and this you want to do gradually that's tahini toasted sesame paste we're now building an emulsion which requires adding the fat little by little and stirring really aggressively you can do this in the food processor but i think that makes the dip a little too smooth monsoon now let's do some olive oil same deal really beat it in and then do it again you generally do two or three times as much olive oil compared to the tahini stir stir stir and then give it a taste i'ma go with the other half of the lemon and all of my garlic the garlic actually does cook a little if the eggplant is still hot and more tahini for that nutty note love that stir stir stir taste again more salt and then i'll finish it with more olive oil little by little and you can see this is starting to exhibit the characteristic trait of emulsions where they actually get stiffer and thicker the more liquid fat you stir in if you tried to dump it all in at once it would take way more physical agitation to get that fat bashed up into tiny little droplets and coated in emulsifiers and water the emulsifiers are in the vegetable matter mucilage in the eggplant saponins and the garlic there's lots of them super creamy put in as much fresh herb as you want you can do spices cumin coriander sumac would be awesome but i think it's better when you can really taste the flavor of the roasted eggplant which is relatively subtle in a bowl and it's never going to be pretty but you can smooth off the top some people make little designs in the surface and you can do the hummus trick of floating a nice pretty film of oil on top okay time for the bread the fire is still plenty hot i'll scrape off the bars and then fetch my stack of doughs peel them off the paper and plop them down which is super easy to do when they're cold and firm look at those bubbles oops i should have flipped that one a little sooner if you want the bread to be somewhat soft pull these when they still look a little doughy i want crispy and crackery bread to contrast with these soft dips so i'm baking these like all the way here's the dough we did not dock with the fork check out how you get one giant steam bubble in the middle that's basically how you make pocket pita just with a wetter dough again if you want them soft pull them before they look done but also if you want them soft don't put the cornmeal in the dough that's gonna make it super crackery which again is what i'm going for all right you're done everybody can gather around rip and dip it's great how much smoky flavor translates into the dip and that bread stays nice and crispy even when inundated hey by the way did you know that baba ganoush is arabic for flirty dad look it up if you don't believe me that's what it is

***RECIPE,...",29:02.6, icebox cakes are a delightful 20th century throwback they are not baked they're usually just pre-packaged cookies or wafers covered in whipped cream and then left in the fridge overnight the whole mask kind of melts together into something you could call a cake this particular zebra cake is the archetypal icebox cake in my mind and it's traditionally made with prepackaged chocolate wafers but i'm going to make my own because i want a texture that's more solid and less baby food-like than the original to that end i'm also using a secret ingredient in the whipped cream that makes it stiffer more substantial first the chocolate a stick of butter 113 grams i'm just melting that in the microwave i'm not gonna bother getting it soft and creaming it i want a dense chewy texture a cup and a quarter 250 grams of brown sugar or white sugar with a glug of molasses because that's all brown sugar is a little glug of vanilla a big lug of milk to help the cookies spread and get crispy a small pinch of salt if i was using unsalted butter i would use a large pinch and a dash of baking powder i would guess three quarters of a cup of cocoa powder at least at least 75 grams most of the mass of the cake is going to be whipped cream so this is where the flavor comes from lots of chocolate dutch cocoa for that oreo flavor beat the lumps out of that and now if i just put in flour and bake these i would have chocolate wafers which are the traditional thing instead i'm putting in one egg which will push this more into cookie territory egg will keep the cookie from fully dissolving inside the whipped cream as wafers do i want some texture in the final product a cup of flour 120 grams also in the name of texture i'm putting in a cup of chocolate chips mini chips so they're not too big and crunchy when cold but they'll be small and crunchy when cold again i'm trying to get away from that totally soft baby food vibe of the traditional icebox cake okay you could just bake this in dollops like any cookie or you could grab some parchment or plastic wrap dump everything out roughly shape it into a log and then throw that in the fridge or the freezer when it's gotten hard enough to hold its shape you can really shape it into a perfect log chill it one more time until quite firm then you can just take a knife and slice off perfect rounds like that about yay wide cut it up fast before it warms up and gets too soft or tries to talk to a whale this method will get us cookies of uniform size and shape that will stack on top of each other really cleanly if you care three trays worth in the oven at 350 fahrenheit 180c they'll take 10 or 12 minutes just bake them until they look done they don't have to be perfect because they're going to be soaked in cream they do have to cool all the way down might as well chill for a moment on my sofa from all form the sponsor of this video a year of children and now dogs have done nothing to diminish the look

com slash adam regucia my full name allform.com adam ragusia for 20 off your sofa thank you all for okay we're gonna need a stupid amount of whipped cream for this icebox cake is mostly whipped cream i've got three pints of cream which is almost one and a half liters and the secret ingredient to give it depth of flavor and a more substantial texture is malted milk powder my best friend in dessert making you could just use regular milk powder if you don't want that malted grain flavor but i think it's delicious extra milk protein from powder is often used by bakers to thicken whipped cream and to make it more stable less likely to deflate in the fridge over time i'd do at least a tablespoon per cup of cream so i've got what six or eight tablespoons in there maybe 80 grams total that's a drink mix so it has some sugar but we'll need more this is a ton of cream and it's not going to be sweetened by a bunch of other elements in the cake so half a cup of granulated sugar 100 grams a glug of vanilla and then it's time to beat adding sugar and powders to cream before you whip it definitely slows down the whipping process but it also does a much better job of getting everything dissolved and dispersed that's particularly important for the milk powder which tends to clump if you're whipping with a power tool i say just add the stuff up front and wait a couple extra minutes it'll seem like nothing is working until boom whipped cream give it a taste and add sugar if you think it needs it it should taste like a finished dessert all on its own the cookies have fully cooled i can reuse this parchment and build my cakes on it i'm doing several smaller cakes instead of one big one just so i can show you some different ways of doing it onto the base of cream goes a cookie then more cream then another cookie and then i'll just build my stack you can make an individual portion this way or this is more like a cake for two smooth it off you might have an easier time getting the sides really smooth after this chills if you care you can do that with whipped cream unlike other frostings that set up too hard in the fridge all right here's the traditional fancy way of building this an upright log grab two or three cookies and put cream between them together they're now wide enough that they will stand upright on their sides and then you just lay in more and more traditionally you would do this as one big long log i'm just doing a little stump i suppose let's do another little tower in case i don't get a good finished product shot of the first one i have to worry about such things you could of course just layer everything haphazardly in a cake pan lasagna style what do you think it's good now you literally just throw it in the fridge and wait until tomorrow the whole mask kind of melts together and the cream firms up you should have a few cookies left over to throw into a bag and smash into a nice fine crumb sprinkle that over top it makes anything look nice and here's why i assembled and chilled the cakes on the sheet pan instead of on my serving plate grab a spatula and yoink totally clean surface on the serving plate now with traditional ice icebox zebra cake this is when you slice down one side and get a clean cut showing these beautiful delicate ribbons of chocolate because my cake actually has texture it doesn't cut as cleanly it mashes a little but i'm sorry it tastes way better than the old version made with store-bought wafers that just disintegrate the fact that this doesn't cut so clean argues for making single portion cakes or lovers portions in this case that's a beautiful thing to hand to somebody and they can mess it up themselves still looks awfully pretty to me and that cream has an outrageous deep flavor thanks to the malted milk the malt gives it a slight yellow hue but again you don't come to this dessert for refined appearances you come for a sloppy summertime oreo snowball

*These statements have not been evaluated...",29:02.6, i'm bringing sexy beans legume-based recipes that should satisfy even a meat-eater such as myself here's a grilled green bean sandwich lots of melted cheese a nice glossy sauce and it's all made practical by the use of chinese long beans generally available fresh in any asian market here in the states but the first thing we'll need to do is make the perfect garnish for pretty much any hot sandwich and that of course is pink pickled onions cut a red onion into narrow wedges from tip to root this one onion will make considerably more pickles than i need for this sandwich but that's fine you can eat these on anything into a glass cup and a half 350 ml of vinegar into a pot with a pinch of salt and like a handful of sugar bring to a boil and pour over the onions that'll clear your sinuses i prefer no heat methods for making these pickles but if you need pickles immediately as i do right now it's best to use a little heat cool these down and they're ready to go now for the sauce i've got like a tablespoon of cornstarch which i'll disperse in just enough water to make a slurry it's easier to stir lumps out of a thick liquid into that i'm putting a whole cup of soy sauce 240 mils and then a really big glug of molasses but you could use any form of sugar peel and dice some fresh ginger if you want to but powdered dry ginger tastes virtually the same in a cooked sauce that is less so the case with powdered dry garlic but garlic powder still tastes pretty good and maybe a pinch of chili flakes then a big splash of the juice from the pickles that i just made soy or another salty meaty sauce plus a little thickener some spice something sweet and something sour it's a foolproof formula for a sauce bring to a boil stirring constantly when it gets really thick there's tons of sugar in here that could stick to the bottom and burn just reduce this until it's the texture that you want which should not take long cool to the point where you can taste it and adjust as necessary remember it should be too salty on its own to everything really it's a flavoring for something else comparatively bland i want it sweeter so more molasses this is more sauce than we'll need for the sandwich but throw this in the fridge and you can use it in a million things it's asian barbecue sauce i'll thin slice a couple of fresh red chilies everything that goes on a sandwich needs to be really thin and you can do that without seeding them and then pick up the slices out of the pile of seeds that fall out just leave them behind chinese long beans about a pound 450 grams they basically taste like other green beans but they're a different species they're a variety of cow pea now tell me this sandwich wasn't meant to be get yourself a matching long bread that is soft the softer the better a crusty baguette or something will not do it'll be rock hard after grilling get that cut in half i'll just snip the stem ends off of these beans the tails you can leave intact unless they're really dry or showing signs of decay as these are hey there's the actual beans inside the pod which make this a not insignificant source of protein plus we have all that fiber in the pod good for the gut but if your sandwiches aren't always this healthy you might consider the sponsor of this video ritual ritual of course makes my go-to

by going to ritual.com 20 adam and use my code 20 adam at checkout that's all in the description thank you ritual okay i'll drizzle enough oil on the long beans for a light coating and i do think this comes out better if you put a little salt on these directly but go easy because the sauce is super salty all right i've got about eight ounces 225 grams of muenster cheese slices i'm snipping them in half so they don't hang over the sides of the sandwich too far any cheese that melts will work for this all right chili slices sauce pickles that's everything out to the grill i've had this coming to moderate heat for about 15 minutes and here's what makes the long beans so grillable they don't fall between the grates as long as you lay them perpendicular to the grates i'll close the lid to trap the heat i want to let those get pretty brown and soft before proceeding which should only take like five minutes tops if you undercook the beans they're going to be stringy and hard to eat in the context of a sandwich soft is good i put them on the back of the grill so that i have room up front for the bread i'll first toast the cut sides for a moment until they've got a little color flip them over and lay down the first layer of cheese i would suggest laying it on heavy and if it drapes over the sides a little bit that's good too much and it'll burn now i'm sure there's a way to move these grilled beans with something other than two sets of tongs but i don't want to be the one to figure it out i have two sets of tongs and i am using them only half the beans on at first i want to thread the toppings through the beans scoop on some of that meaty meatless sauce lay on some pickled onions and a few chilies then another layer of cheese cooked vegetable sandwiches tend to be really slippery stuff just slides out of them as you eat so i'm melting cheese through the beans to bind everything together rest of the beans go on top on goes the sauce be heavy with it it's where almost all of your umami is coming from more pickles and more chili slices another day i might throw some thin sliced prosciutto or other cured meat on here but you know not today then lay on one more layer of cheese to melt and bind everything together munster is a great cheese for making melts of all kinds it's strong enough to compete with other strong flavors and it melts really smoothly all right lid onto the sandwich and at this point you could wrap the whole thing in foil to make it steam through and soften the bread a bit or if you want the bread really crispy you can just cover the lid turn off the heat and let it sit for a minute until melted through absolutely you could make this sandwich inside in the oven under the broiler instead and there you go enough sandwich to feed a family the only reason i'm cutting this on the grill instead of bringing it inside like a civilized person is that i can get a sexy thumbnail how's it taste the beans really give it a great meaty texture and we get meaty flavor from the sauce and of course pink pickled onions are the ideal hot sandwich condiment sweet sour pungent and a little crunchy you should of course bring the sandwich inside like a civilized person again if you like a softer texture just wrap this in foil after you've got it finally assembled and let the bread steam through and hey if you think green beans can't go on a sandwich ask the people of chile about their traditional chocaro sandwich chileans know from sexy beans

My old video about anthocyanins...",29:02.6, you know there's a reason all the food youtubers garnish their dishes with pink pickled onions they really pop in a thumbnail see but we also use them because they're a snap to make they add welcome crunch and brightness and pungency to all kinds of savory dishes and yeah they're real pretty there are however at least three basic ways of making them and today we're going to test eight different recipes i will summarize my findings for you now though all the basic recipes work and the results are surprisingly similar so just do whichever one is easiest for you but if you need pickles today use one of the methods involving heat if you can wait until tomorrow or the next day even better my favorite method remains using no heat at all just soak the onions in some vinegar and or lime juice maybe some sugar a little salt throw it in the fridge two days later you got the best pink pickled onions ever to my taste at least but of course the first thing you need to do is cut the onion and the way you cut it does matter to a point get a red onion other kinds will work they just won't be pink and you imagine the onion is a globe with the blossom and root ends representing the north and south poles first bisect the onion longitudinally pull to pole then peel i agree with the majority opinion that it is best to use further longitudinal cuts to slice it into thin wedges a french onion orbit around leave all the pieces attached at the base to hold them together and when you're done you just snip off the roots and they fall apart perfect could you make latitudinal cuts instead sure and that's easier if you're not confident with your knife but there are two arguments against doing it this way people say slicing across the onion like this damages more cells which results in more pungent flavor as you may know the really pungent flavor compounds in onions and garlic don't actually exist when the onion is in it's an intact form you have to cut it rupture the cells and then compounds that are normally separated combine chemical reactions ensue and you get that really kind of hot pungent flavor it's a defense mechanism for the plant people say cutting the onion crosswise results in more cellular damage maybe because we're cutting perpendicular to the plant's vascular system you can see the cross section of the xylem and the phloem there that's what those little circles are in 2019 j kenji lopez alt did a little experiment where he sliced onions crosswise then he sliced them lengthwise then he put the separate samples into sealed containers and left them for 10 minutes then he popped open the containers and he smelled the onion he sliced crosswise it gave off a much stronger whiff indicating more cellular damage more pungent flavor people now often advise slicing onions lengthwise and they cite kenji's experiment as their justification but it's important to remember there that kenji was experimenting with onions for a very specific purpose burgers fresh-cut raw onions to put on a burger and to eat raw when you cook your onions or soak them in acid for a few days you're gonna do at least as much cellular damage as you could possibly do with a knife to say nothing of the cellular damage that you're gonna do when you actually you know chew your food and so i just don't think it's the same thing nonetheless i still agree that it's best to slice them pole to pull because the resulting pieces look a lot prettier especially after they've pickled latitudinal slices like these tend to be a lot more stringy and floppy but that doesn't really matter that much do whatever you want to pickle these i'll mostly be using good old white distilled vinegar often used as a cleaning product rather than a food you need a lot of vinegar to make these pickles white distilled is by far the cheapest kind and i really don't notice much of a difference in the final product compared to more expensive vinegars especially once you put the pickles on actual food let's take a second to clarify that we are making refrigerator pickles today these are not old school pickles the kind that you can like put in a jar and then put in the basement and keep there for like two years at room temperature it'll be fine these are not that in order to make that kind of pickle you have to like sterilize all of your instruments you have to really closely monitor your ph and your salinity and make sure that it's in a correct range you have to force all of the air out of the jar it is a whole thing we are not doing that with refrigerator pickles you just soak stuff in acid and put it in the fridge to slow any microbial growth that's it a food much more relevant to modern life much like hellofresh the sponsor of

pickle the onions for sample number one i'm just gonna cover the onions in straight vinegar cup and a half 350 mls for one small onions worth of slices for flavor i usually do a pinch of salt i'm measuring a quarter teaspoon for consistency today and then i usually do a little handful of sugar a teaspoon today for consistency though you could use a lot more sugar if you really like sweet pickles give that a little stir everything will dissolve in time and that's it no cooking no nothing throw it in the fridge for example number two i'll do what i normally do which is submerge the onions about halfway up in vinegar same amount of salt and sugar in time the acid breaks down the onions and they release tons of their internal water they will end up submerged or nearly submerged you'll see now let's try the hot methods for sample number three i'm going to bring my 350 mls of vinegar to a boil again quarter teaspoon of salt full teaspoon of sugar then you just pour the boiling solution over the onions lots of recipes will tell you to do just that sample number four will be the same procedure except i'm using half vinegar half water lots of recipes tell you to do this the solution should still be plenty acidic enough but it won't be quite as harsh on top would it make a difference if we boiled the onions with the vinegar let's find out with sample number five everything in the pot bring it to a boil dump it out into the glass the third basic procedure for making these pickles is a blanching procedure you pour plain boiling water over the onions count to five or ten or something and then strain dump the water out onions in the glass dump in room temperature vinegar salt and sugar that's sample number six sample number seven will be the mexican inspired recipe made famous in the u.s at least by chef rick bayless he blanches the onions for 10 seconds in boiling water pours the water off and instead of using vinegar he uses fresh squeezed lime juice lime juice generally has a ph around 2.5 just like white vinegar but it is a natural product and therefore it varies somewhat you definitely won't want to boil the lime juice you'd lose all of that fresh flavor some salt and sugar for my last sample i'm going to test the influence of spices i got some black peppercorns coriander seeds mustard seeds dried chili juniper cloves all common pickling spices i'm toasting them dry which usually intensifies their flavor a bit i'll let those steep in the vinegar as it comes to a boil pour that over salt and sugar that is sample number eight i'll wait until all of the hot samples have steamed off before covering to test these i think we need to taste them at a series of time intervals so first let's taste them after they just been soaking for a couple hours so it's the same day it's just two or three hours later the samples we didn't cook at all look nice and taste nice but they're more like marinated onions than pickles they're still really crunchy and they're not yet uniformly pink the ones where we boiled the vinegar they immediately seem like pickles chill them down and they're pickles but to me these taste less fresh they taste cooked unsurprisingly here's the ones we blanched pour over boiling water wait 10 seconds then strain texturally that is a nice compromise between the raw pickles and the cooked ones they still have some nice crunch the pink color isn't quite uniform yet after just two hours but i mean those are pickles so my first conclusion is if you need pickles today and you have time to bring a pot to a boil use one of the hot solution methods i like the blanching one mostly because that involves bringing water to a boil instead of vinegar and boiling vinegar really sticks up the kitchen but let's throw these in the fridge go to bed and taste them tomorrow good night good morning pickles are now a day old the totally raw onions look and feel more like pickles but they're still pretty crisp and fresh which i like the ones where we poured over hot vinegar these taste basically the same as they did yesterday which is to say they taste nice but noticeably softer than the raw onions the ones we blanched for 10 seconds in the boiling water are much nicer in my opinion crispier and the pink color is fully uniform after a day why does that happen well red onions contain a class of compounds called anthocyanins we did a whole video about anthocyanins it is in the description pretty much whenever an edible plant is blue or purple or pink the reason is anthocyanins red onions of course are not actually red they're purple and the anthocyanins are concentrated in the outer layer of each leaf the acid and also the heat breaks down the onion cells spilling their contents into the solution and everything equilibrates across the entire mass the onion piece acquires a uniform color and it's pink rather than red because of the low ph acids turn anthocyanins from blue to purple to pink if you want to have some real fun cook some red onions in some water and instead of lowering the ph raise it put in a base baking soda it immediately pushes the anthocyanin in past blue and into the green part of the spectrum delicious anyway let's taste the pickles after two days in the fridge and i will give you my final opinions day three everybody out of the fridge sample number one is raw onions fully submerged in vinegar the raw ones just get better and better every day yet still retain their fresh crispiness really nice even better in my opinion is sample number two which we just covered in vinegar halfway up water leaks out of the onions everything ends up covered the taste is less harsh because there's proportionally less vinegar and we're not diluting the flavor with added water also we've wasted less vinegar those are great if you can wait a couple of days for them but question how safe are these given that we did not pasteurize them with heat are there any microorganisms in here that could breed slowly but surely in the refrigerator as these sit for weeks on end in there well let's test its ph 3.2 that's real acidic remember 7 is neutral at that ph most common food pathogens should either die or not be able to reproduce that said i probably wouldn't keep any refrigerator pickles for longer than i don't know a couple of weeks there's just no reason to risk it it's not like the olden days where you had to pickle everything that you grew right before the winter these you can make in small batches it's fine sample number three we covered in boiling vinegar it's amazing how little these change with time still nice but less crisp the ph here by the way is 2.9 which is more acidic simply because we fully submerge these in vinegar more vinegar more acid sample number four was the same procedure but we used half vinegar half water the ph here is 3.3 and you definitely taste the difference less acidic less harsh nicer on their own but we don't eat these pickles on their own we usually eat them on food and when i put the full vinegar pickles on a nacho i personally prefer those compared to the half vinegar pickles on a nacho the half vinegar ones aren't strong enough for me once diluted with a bunch of food but you know your experience may vary sample number five is the only one i don't like these are the onions we boiled with the vinegar totally edible but too slimy for my taste they just broke down too much in the heat would not make again sample number six is the blanched onions 10 seconds in boiling water and then drained again a nice compromise between the cooked and raw onions and again very little change from day to day i think another justification for that blanche and drain procedure is that it theoretically washes away some of the pungent compounds in onions that people might find overpowering for what it's worth i notice no difference in the onion pungency across any of these samples i think it all just evens out with the pickling here's the rick bayless onions blanched then pickled in lime juice way too strong for me all i taste is lime and i love lime but i want to taste onions too the ph is 2.3 i may have gotten a particularly acidic bunch of limes my conclusion there is that if i'm going to use lime juice i will use it in addition to vinegar not in place of vinegar just a little splash of lime for some extra flavor and freshness finally sample number eight is the one with the spices and the spice flavors just keep getting stronger day after day i'm getting noticeable heat from the chili now and the clove especially is totally overpowering if you're going to play with spices and pickling solutions be conservative you only need a little but again i want to emphasize that all of these tasted way more similar than i would have expected so just do the one that's easiest for you the one thing you don't want to do is use a base instead of an acid here's what's left of the baking soda onions after three days great way to dispose of your enemies once you've disposed of your pickles don't throw away the juice use it to make sweet and sour sauces or just cut up another vegetable like these cucumbers and throw those in the solution the next day they'll look like this and they'll be even better tomorrow man i love pickles

would you make for a bunch of non-vegans coming over to eat at your house something that would impress and satisfy meat eaters well my answer is this mushroom risotto i've made mushroom risotto on this channel before but i think this one is better yes because it has those showy king trumpet mushrooms on top but more importantly because the stock is based on dried mushrooms a little handful per portion in my experience the more fragrant they are dry the stronger the stock they'll make for example those porcini are way more intense than these shiitake but that's probably due to the drying method rather than the species you'll have to shop around and experiment try to find the strongest tasting dried mushrooms that are also cheap there's no point in paying top dollar for dried morels or something i got some bay leaves maybe they'll do something i don't know fill that up with water i'd say at least two cups 500 mils per portion heat on high a big pinch of salt per portion bring that to a boil reduce to a simmer and in my experience most of the flavor is extracted within a half hour though that will depend on how thin the pieces are i'll give this an hour during which time i can think about the fresh mushrooms if you want more interesting choices for fresh mushrooms here in the u.s go to an asian market they usually have way cooler shrooms year round these are king trumpet mushrooms these i will use to make a big steak like garnish for the rice wash off any dirt if there is any unfortunately the stems on these really tall thick varieties tend to be pretty tough and woody with the big ones you gotta trim pretty far up from the mycelial end before the stem is tender again you can feel with your knife where it gets tender any trimmings without dirt i might as well throw in with my stock though they won't do very much dry mushrooms are far stronger than fresh ones especially fresh mushrooms that you have not yet browned i have a whole video explaining what makes dried mushrooms so intense it's in the description these trimmed king trumpets i'll cut in half lengthwise to preserve their shape and this is extremely optional but i'm going to score the cut sides shallow slashes running in that direction turn the mushroom 90 degrees and do it again i'm gonna marinate these mushrooms and maybe the scoring will allow more of the marinade to penetrate i can't say for sure what i can say is they'll look real sexy when cooked like grill marks again the assignment was to come up with something vegan and impressive throw those in a bowl coat them in some nice olive oil pepper and salt and then some balsamic vinegar i'm using white balsamic but anything will work it's amazing how much of the vinegar the mushroom will absorb so don't put a ton in there note this is not how you make the traditional italian contourno of marinated mushrooms to make those you need to blanch the mushrooms in boiling water first i tried making this risotto with blanched and unblanched mushrooms and the unblanched ones sauteed up much nicer better browning more tender texture i'm only using the biggest ones for my garnish the smaller ones i'll trim slice and then put inside the risotto speaking of small i've also got some fresh shimeji mushrooms also known as beech mushrooms they ship these attached to a big block of their mycelium which is great it keeps them fresh but you have to trim it away and note that it still has some of its substrate the wood compost clinging to it it'll take some work to get each of these stems trimmed to the point where they feel tender but after i do that i'll do nothing else i won't cut these by the time they cook and shrink they'll be the perfect scale for the inside of a risotto they'll be tiny but they'll still look like mushrooms which is nice post trimming i've got like 400 grams nearly a pound of fresh mushrooms per portion here which may seem like a lot but remember how much mushrooms shrink last bit of prep is to dice like one big shallot for every two portions i'm doing two big dinner size portions here and then i'll grab some garlic which i'm just gonna crush and peel i'm not gonna chop this i'm using it

straining these through a coffee filter to catch any bits of sand dried mushrooms can have that but you can also just let the sand settle to the bottom and then pour off everything but the last little bit the rehydrated mushrooms are edible but very tough you'd need to slice them thinly and or cook them a lot longer to get them soft all their flavor is in the stock and i bought cheap ones so i have no trouble just throwing those on the compost this pots already dirty so i might as well cook the risotto in here a little olive oil to fry the shallot over moderate heat get in there and cook it for a minute until you can see the pieces starting to go soft standard risotto technique says don't let anything brown but we're making a brown risotto so it's fine one little extra imma do is throw in a handful of mustard seeds i'll let those fry for a second and they'll rehydrate as the rice cooks and develop a great texture in goes half a cup about 100 grams of risotto rice per portion i'm using arborio but lots of short grain rice is suitable for risotto just do not wash it you need the free starch coat on the rice to thicken the stock and you lose some of that thickening power if you toast the rice for too long starch damage so just toast it for a minute for a little flavor and then deglaze traditionally the first dose of liquid is white wine you don't have to use it you could just use the mushroom stock with a little splash of that white balsamic vinegar added since this is a vegan recipe i'll point out that most wine is not considered vegan this brand is because they do not use any animal proteins as clarifiers in goes a good dose of the mushroom stock at least enough to cover you really don't have to add the liquid for risotto little by little the main reason to be conservative is you don't know how much liquid the rice will actually absorb but it'll take at least this much for sure in a little pan i'll heat a bunch of olive oil to fry the fresh mushrooms medium high heat will probably do it on my stove but every stove is different you want enough heat to really brown the cut sides but not before the rest of the mushroom has cooked and softened up mushrooms contain a glucose polymer called chitin it's very tough and indigestible but it breaks down with cooking gotta stir the rice every now and then to make sure none of it is sticking to the bottom which it will if you don't stir i'll move these big king trumpets around to make sure that each of them is getting nice color on the cut side look how beautiful that is i told you the scoring would be sexy now i'm going to drop in my crushed garlic and cook these the way that i might cook a steak get plenty of oil in the pan and use a spoon to baste the mushrooms and hot garlicky fat if you're down with dairy i would use butter for this stage spoon basting like this is great for cooking something with a highly irregular shape we couldn't possibly fry these mushrooms on all sides against a flat pan when the rice is looking dry add more stock be more conservative than i just was you don't know how much liquid the rice is actually going to take lordy these mushrooms are going to be good when they've shrunk by maybe a third half at most they're cooked i'll just lift each one out to the plate remember these are my garnish which is why i'm being so precious with them i'll also take out the garlic before it burns which it will that's why you leave the cloves whole easy to pick out next thing i'll throw in is my smaller king trumpets that i sliced toss those in the hot oil and give them some salt the big ones we seasoned in the marinade give those a couple of minute head start and then i'll throw in the little beach mushrooms which should only take a couple of minutes get them coated in hot oil stir the risotto give it some more stock if it's looking dry it'd be nice to deglaze that pan with something and i got my cavazier right here i remembered to turn off the flame this time direct flame on a gas stove can ignite booze i love mushrooms with any barrel aged spirit anything that gives you the flavor of wood but you could certainly just use water or more of your white wine everything's coated in a nice glaze so i'll turn off the heat and just save those for now the rice has been cooking 15-20 minutes i'll taste it still just a little crunchy which means it's time to turn off the heat and stop by the time we actually eat the rice will be perfect time to stir in our smaller fresh mushrooms and all their juices gorgeous the risotto may look a little dry at this point you can always add a little more water or whatever at the very end to get the texture you want i'm keeping it dry at this stage because instead of finishing this with butter and parmesan cheese as traditional i'm going to finish it with vegan sour cream this is the very best non-dairy alternative for enriching risotto you get the additional fats that you'd get from the butter and you get the lactic acid tang that you'd get from the cheese the only problem is you need a lot of it and it brings more moisture than butter and cheese do so it's best to start with a risotto on the dry side before you stir this in as much as you want to make it as rich as you want i'm going to tear in some fresh tarragon at the last minute i like tarragon and mushrooms but time would be great sage would be great parsley maybe a little more of that cream i am not vegan and i did not miss the butter and cheese at all in this risotto the vegan sour cream really does the business scoop that out again we've got two full dinner size portions here smooth out the top and then we can lay on our big mushroom steaks they'll look great as is but they'll shine more with a little oil on top and i'm using truffle oil the gordon ramsays of this world turn up their noses at truffle oil because it usually isn't made with actual truffles but i think it still tastes really nice and it's very strong just a little at the end cooking would destroy the truffle flavor so use it at the end like i said i'm not vegan but to me that is still a very satisfying impressive and meaty dinner tons of meaty flavor from the dried mushroom stock and meat texture from these king trumpet mushrooms cut them with a steak knife you'll need it truthfully when i make this again i'll probably make it with butter and cheese but you do you and if you need to feed a whole dinner party full of people you can easily do that risotto is super scalable maybe just saute the fresh mushrooms in advance to give you a little less to worry about as you're cooking the rice let me know what your guests think
Citrus beef stir fry with grilled peppers,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HM1BJ_JXj20/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLDDJgeXiJXQ6HKsQMByIrt0CJZDDA,HM1BJ_JXj20,"7 minutes, 53 seconds","Thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this video! Go to Squarespace.com for a free trial, and when you’re ready to launch, go to http://squarespace.com/ragusea and add code “RAGUSEA"" at...",29:02.6, this recipe is sponsored by squarespace i did it with beans the other day now i'm gonna do it with beef this has become my new favorite cooking method stir fry in a pan on my outdoor grill this has so many advantages over doing it inside certainly you could make this dish inside but either you'll need to use a lower temperature which won't get you the same flavor or you'll need an excellent ventilation system which you may have you don't have to marinate the beef in advance but if you can it tastes even better i'll squeeze the juice of one lime and then throw in a roughly equal quantity of soy sauce a good base for any marinade is one part strong acid one part umami salty sauce like soy or worcestershire or fish sauce and then two or three parts other stuff i'm throwing in a couple tablespoons molasses but you could use any form of sugar i cannot stop using korean fermented chili paste gochujang but you don't have to it's pretty spicy you could replace it with a big squeeze of tomato paste or ketchup to build on my citrus theme i'm going to squeeze in an orange a very weak acid it basically functions like water in this context and i'm going to add some more water enough to get me about a cup total of liquid this is my marinade and my sauce without the water the sauce will be too strong once cooked now let's do a squeeze of mustard this is kind of an east-west barbecue sauce after all i've got a bunch of green onions trim off the roots slice everything into thin rounds i'll throw the wider half of those in with my sauce and i'll reserve my greener half for later this is viscous enough and cold enough that i can just add some cornstarch directly to it rather than mixing up a slurry first we won't have any lumps in the end a teaspoon or two depending on how thick you like your sauce oh and i want some ginger but i don't have any so dried ginger like the kind that you use in gingerbread individuals i'm sorry but this tastes virtually identical to fresh ginger in a cooked sauce and it's a whole lot more convenient okay meat this is about 500 grams little over a pound of skirt steak easily one of my top three cuts of beef but you could use all kinds of things skirt comes in a long strip that i'm cutting up into shorter sections and now i can stack these sections and slice against the grain perpendicular to the very obvious meat fibers if you don't cut skirt steak against the grain it's almost inedibly chewy i would go kind of thick on these slices maybe half a centimeter any thinner and the beef will probably be overcooked and chewy by the time the sauce is done all right everybody in the water as little as an hour or two would make a difference but i'm putting this in the fridge overnight next morning i'll grab my widest cast iron pan and rub it down with a little oil a very thin layer this isn't necessary but i might as well do it because next it goes into my gas grill that i'll get going on maximum heat the oil will burn off out here and i'll have a fresh seasoning coat when i cook cover it to retain the heat next step is i'll get like two cups of jasmine rice going 250 300 grams and today i'm boiling it pasta style in a big pot with tons of excess water this is an unfairly maligned method it's nice because you don't have to measure a thing you don't have to wash the rice the free starch just goes into the water that will drain off later and the texture comes out real nice you'll see here's a couple handfuls of small sweet peppers i've got some banana peppers some other things i'll just cut them in half and pull out the seeds you could use hot peppers instead but i would not use bell peppers bell peppers are too thick they would not be done in time i'll drizzle those with some olive oil sprinkle with salt and pepper and toss after the rice has been going like 15 minutes i can just fish out a few grains and taste for doneness when they're almost perfect i can just drain this into a colander it'll look like rice soup at first but let it drain let it steam off and you'll have super fluffy rice every time without having to know the perfect water ratio for this particular rice it just takes what it needs i'm going to embellish this today with the juice of a lime and then the onion greens that we retained they'll get cooked in the residual heat last little bit of prep a plate with some paper towels on it take the marinated beef out squeeze as much marinade out as i can and then dry the beef on the towels i want to save as much of this liquid as i can for my sauce but i need it off the surface of my beef for now if the beef is really wet it won't brown squeeze it as dry as you can then toss the towel to further enhance browning i'll drizzle some oil on this meat and toss it doesn't need any seasoning the salt from the soy sauce and the gochujang is enough push that to one side and i'll throw my peppers on the other side grab a handful of cilantro maybe it doesn't matter if it touches the meat it's all gonna get cooked now i have one plate and one jug of sauce to carry outside if that film of oil you rubbed on the pan is still smoking that means it's not hot enough yet it should have totally burned off that's another reason i like doing that last minute seasoning it functions like a thermometer this pan has been getting rocket hot for like 20 minutes so the meat is going to smoke when it goes on and that's good this is also why i like doing this outside once i've pushed the meat into an even thin layer for maximum browning i will dump my peppers onto the bars with this method i can grill while i stir-fry when everything is in place i'll close the lid to retain heat because gas grills really don't get that hot usually literally a minute or two later i'll flip my peppers though honestly you could cook them all the way on one side if you want to a bunch of water is coming out of the beef and onions so no more browning is possible that's totally fine because the insane dry heat we got up front was enough to get that flavor they call wakey in cantonese that smoky flavor you get inside an extremely hot wok generally in a restaurant kitchen with excellent ventilation we've got that here one side of each piece is dark brown but overall the beef is still undercooked which is how you want it to be when the sauce goes in i'll just stir to deglaze all the good flavor then i'll close the grill again to retain heat in one further minute the sauce should have thickened the beef should be cooked through and the pepper is tender if those things have not quite happened yet they will by the time you stir in the cilantro lift all the peppers into the pan and then get this whole thing inside dear lord use very thick totally dry mitts or you will get burned the sauce over reduced just during the trip inside i'll water it down slightly i'll do the bowl trick with the rice because i'm feeling fancy get them smoky grilled peppers on there and the beef whether you want to make my sauce or not try doing stir fries outside on the grill if you have a grill and an outside if you've had good chinese food you'll recognize that delicious wakey flavor immediately and it's really hard to achieve that inside without making a ton of smoke so don't don't do it inside if there's no reason to do things the hard way then don't do them the hard way that's what squarespace believes there's no reason to design

***TRADITIONAL RECIPE, SERVES FOUR***

2 egg whites
1 lb (454g) fresh...",29:02.6, one of the most british things on earth eaton mess by mess the brits mean a big mixture of food strawberries whipped cream and crumpled up meringue cookies and of course by cookies i mean biscuits it's a cafeteria classic from eaton college by college of course the brits mean public school and by public school of course they mean private school it's posh schoolboy food i'm going to show you four slightly different ways of making it plus one very different way the meringue you want to make the day before a couple of eggs in a mixing bowl fish out the yolks some people are grossed out about it but this is increasingly my favorite way to separate eggs you have a lot more control and you're less likely to puncture the egg on its shell for the traditional recipe you don't use the yolks at all so save those for something else a shake of cream of tartar in there to stabilize the foam or a few drops of lemon would do instead beat until you've got a stiff foam like that just takes a couple minutes for a baked meringue you generally want 25 or 30 grams of sugar per white so i've got 50 grams half a cup of granulated sugar that i'm gradually beating in with this much sugar there is a risk you could collapse the foam if you put it all in at once beat some more until it's nice and stiff maybe give it a tiny pinch of salt for flavor and a splash of vanilla and that's done to make these pretty you'd normally squeeze the batter out of a piping bag with a star tip on the end but we're literally just gonna crumple these up so i'm spooning out dollops you still have to bake them as distinct cookies or maybe as like long narrow strips if you just tried to bake it as one single blob it would not have enough surface area it wouldn't be crunchy enough now i made these with granulated sugar brits might use castor sugar which is kind of halfway between granulated and powdered sugar i can't buy caster sugar here but some people do use powdered sugar for meringue and i'm curious if it'll make any difference so i'm doing this all again with about two-thirds of a cup of powdered sugar it's less dense so you need a slightly greater volume for the same weight 50 or 60 grams interestingly it's less stiff at this stage than the one we did with granulated sugar we seem to have lost more air that surprises me i would think bigger sugar grains would have punctured more bubbles but maybe the tiny particles are actually more disruptive to the bubble structure no idea but we'll see how they bake up and for one other experiment i'm going to make some chocolate meringues same exact recipe except at the end you work in a couple of teaspoons of cocoa powder per egg these are going to be good enough to eat on their own certainly you can just buy meringue cookies instead but those are not as common in stores where i live as they are along the thames bake at a real low temperature 225 fahrenheit 110c powdered sugar meringues are on the i mean top chocolate on the bottom bake for an hour hour and a half until they don't look wet anymore they should still look shiny but not wet then ideally you just turn off the heat and leave them to cool down and dry out just go to bed good night here they are the next day granulated sugar these ones look surprisingly nice as simple dollops nice open texture inside the ones with powdered sugar do not look as nice and they do not taste as nice super dense i'm shocked the chocolate ones are awesome of course the cocoa powder gives them a moister chewier texture like gluten-free brownies not traditional for eaton mess but i'm not a brit i'm just imitating a brit on the internet hey is anybody imitating me on the internet let's check with aura the sponsor of this video true story one time

them as fine or as chunky as you want them the finer you make the crumbs the faster they're going to dissolve in the dish so i'd lean toward big chunks the plurality of the bulk of the dish is generally whipped cream so whip up plenty of cream you won't need this much time making a lot because i'm doing a lot of experiments it always looks like nothing is happening but wait five minutes the membranes on the fat globules suddenly bust open they tangle and form a mesh and boom whipped cream people generally mix a little sugar into this along with some vanilla making this chantilly cream but the other elements of the dish are sweet too so i say make the cream a little under sweet on its own hey for once i didn't over whip it i like when it's super silky like that if you take it any further it starts to get kind of rough and cheesy so strawberries you can use all kinds of berries but strawberries are the tradition i'll cut off all the calyxes that can't be the plural of calyx but for this version i'm going to slice them i want reasonably thin pieces because i'm not going to mash or cook these i'm just going to macerate them scatter in a couple spoonfuls of sugar depending on how sweet the strawberries already are and if you want you can do some booze i'll do a drop of gin then you just let that sit for a while and the sugar will break the strawberries down a bit and form a syrup about them like that so the way i'm sure they did this back at the eaton cafeteria was in one big batch cream strawberries and their juices the proportions are up to you and then some meringue crumbles you have to wait to mix that together until right before you eat because the meringue is going to start dissolving immediately dose out individual bowls and eat i absolutely love the contrast between the crunchy marshmallowy meringue and the soft cream but i feel like i'm not getting enough strawberry from the macerated strawberries maybe that would work if you have really good perfectly in season strawberries but i do not so for version number two i'm gonna quarter the strawberries i want somewhat bigger chunks and then two-thirds of the strawberries i will put into some narrow vessel throw in a couple spoons of sugar and then blitz as the brits would say if you don't have a blender you could just mash them real good with the back of a fork once smooth i'll throw in my one third of intact strawberry quarters for some textural contrast and let's try mixing that into the cream i think i like about two parts cream to one part strawberries by volume and about one part meringue chunks the reason i'm gently folding these together is not to keep the foam from collapsing it won't we established that in a recent video you could just stir it until homogeneous but i don't want it homogenous i want elegant pink streaks running through it gorgeous and the taste is far superior i'm just getting way more strawberry from the pureed strawberries the presentation all mixed up together that's school lunchrific but let's try the more elegant option which is to layer the ingredients in a glass parfait style i think i could have made that look a little nicer but i like having the dry meringue chunks on top great crunch and you can mix everything up yourself as you eat which is kind of fun i guess that was version number three version number four is gonna start much the same way quartered strawberries this time i will use a little lime juice for extra acid not necessary and i'm gonna grab two thirds of the strawberries and cook them with maybe half of that lime juice some sugar and a little spoon of starch stir and the moisture that comes out of the berries should be enough to dissolve and disperse everything but if you're cooking this and it just seems a little too dry like stuff is going to burn you could throw in some water or gin and cook until the starch has visibly gelatinized and the berries are soft enough to mash you could use the stick blender again but this will be chunkier you got to chill this all the way down and then you can mix in the remaining strawberry quarters we want to preserve their freshness a small spoon is really the safest way to get the cream into the glass without smudging the sides drop in a little at a time i think the key to getting clean layers is going to be to make them really thick plenty of cream plenty of meringue a thick band of strawberries on top more cream topped with the meringue to preserve crunch yeah this version is the winner for me i love the velvety jam-like texture we get from the cornstarch and from the cooked berries and we still get fresh flavor and texture from the raw berries i could do without the lime juice though to someone of my general demographic strawberry plus lime or lemon really does taste like kool-aid okay what if you don't want to waste the egg yolks well you could make pastry cream two yolks a tablespoon of starch teaspoon of flour quarter cup of sugar 50 grams splash of vanilla maybe a pinch of salt and then just enough milk at first to get you a very thick paste it's easier to whisk lumps out of a thick paste people use much more elaborate mixing procedures to avoid lumps but i think this is fine a whole cup of milk is in there now 237 mils and i just turn my heat on high and bring this to a boil while whisking constantly this is not the safest way to do it but it is the easiest all of a sudden it'll thicken i might have a few little lumps in there but who cares make sure it's actually boiling before you stop egg yolk thickens at a lower temperature the starch actually needs to boil heat off work in a couple tablespoons of butter and then chill all the way down then you can mix that with equal parts whipped cream by volume to yield creme diplomat my new favorite thing some people put dissolved gelatin in this to thicken it up some more but i don't think that's necessary into this somewhat more robust base i am going to put my chocolate meringues and some sliced bananas apparently eaten mess was originally made with bananas this is not eaten mess but it is real good this recipe and my favorite of the traditional strawberry recipes are what you will find in the description either way don't feel pressured to layer a fancy parfait in a glass you can just mix it up remember it's school lunch
Do you really have to 'fold' egg foams? Can't you just mix them?,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HsMzE2MwN8o/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLB3YqE4nChVo4QZYZj1HISKEC_xbA,HsMzE2MwN8o,"12 minutes, 36 seconds",Thanks to Helix Sleep for sponsoring this video!

Free shipping within the US! #helixsle...,29:02.6, hey you guys you know that technique where you kind of gently fold ingredients together rather than just stirring them you know that technique I've recommended to you probably dozens of times by now I'm really sorry to say but I think it might be I mean in my defense it's not like I invented folding folding is the conventional wisdom it's taught in culinary schools every day it's a core technique of classic French cuisine but according to some experiments I've been doing gentle folding really might be pointless you can just beat your egg white foam or your whipped cream or whatever directly with the other ingredients and your thing will come out basically the same arguably better than if it was folded I'm going to show you some of the experiments I've been doing of late that have led me to this conclusion maybe I'll convince you that folding is pointless maybe I won't but at the very least I'll show you three pretty good little dessert recipes starting with angel food cake one of the simplest sponge cakes angel food cake is extremely sticky so you normally have to line every side of the pan painstakingly was perfectly measured strips of parchment paper I don't have time for that right now so I'm doing the crumple trick I'll crack five eggs into a big bowl and fish out the yolks maybe half a teaspoon spoon of cream of tartar to stabilize the foam drop in the beaters and whip to stiff-ish Peaks then I'll beat in three quarters of a cup of sugar 175 grams until I've got a pretty stiff meringue a little pinch of salt for flavor a little splash of vanilla mix that in done last ingredient is half a cup 60 grams of flour cake flour if you have it the conventional wisdom is you have to cut and fold scrape down the bowl and fold cut and fold the flour granules are not compatible with the foam I'm not sure what the mechanism is but flour does somehow disrupt the bubbles and it'll deflate your phone if you overwork this if you mix it too much the folding procedure is supposed to be more gentle helping you integrate the flour while popping as few Bubbles as possible looks homogeneous enough time to pour that into the loaf pan you can only bake angel food in narrow pans loafs tubes if the area of the cake is too wide it'll collapse in the middle hey you remember the 90s when people consider angel food cake to be a diet dessert because it has no fat solid logic anyway I'm gonna do this again same ingredients same procedure except for the final mixing am I painstakingly weighing out each ingredient to make sure the two sample cakes are identical save for the one variable of the folding no I am not let me tell you about my favorite legal Latin figure of speech de minimis it means in effect too small to be worth worrying about so for example like driving a teeny tiny fraction over the speed limit is technically illegal but it's too trivial for the court to bother itself with if these two cakes come out so similar that I can't tell which factor is responsible for their minor differences then that factor is de minimis it's not worthy of consideration in the context of home cooking this ain't rocket science it's cake okay time to integrate the flour and I'm just gonna beat it in with the electric mixer no folding I'm going to be careful to not overdo it I got to stop and scrape the sides down even then this is still easier than folding 25 seconds total and that is homogeneous into the cake pan volume seems about the same bake for about an hour at 350 Fahrenheit 180c folded angel food cake batter is on the right place your bets now if you think one of the cakes is going to come out fluffier than the other have a little peek and those look exactly the same in terms of volume on the outside at least they both seem as sturdy and cushy as my mattress from Helix sleep the sponsor of this video I'll throw a raw egg onto this mattress no problem my Helix is as stable as Foams get

incredibly sticky it's always a little rough around the edges remember gently folded cake batter is on the right and if anything it's a little less puffy than the other cake though that may just be because I pierced the folded one to test for doneness let's look inside this is the batter that we beat mercilessly instead of folding there's a big bubble in there but that could be coincidence here's the folded cake and no big bubbles yet let's cut a little further into both and yeah come on these are the same they taste the same they feel the same any differences are de minimis I love cake indeed buddy and because angel food has no fat it kind of tastes like the love child of cake and cotton candy highly recommended if you've never had it but let's test folding on something that does have fat fat is generally quite destabilizing for egg Foams as we have discussed previously maybe folding will actually improve a batter that's a little bit richer we'll do a souffle two ounces 60 grams of butter in a saucepan over gentle heat let's make it chocolate for color contrast a quarter pound dark chocolate bar 113 grams whisk until just melted grab three eggs and fish out the yolks drop them in the chocolate along with a pinch of salt and a splash of vanilla whisk smooth a little cream of tartar with the whites beat until stiff peaks then beat in three tablespoons of sugar about 40 grams now souffles are notoriously fussy and sensitive to Minor Details so sure this time I'll weigh everything out I weighed the empty bowl earlier so subtract that from my new weight and that's how many grams of meringue we've got here's how much of the chocolate base we have into a fresh Bowl I'll put half our weight of meringue half our weight of chocolate repeat that with the other half of meringue and now it's time to fold I think I let my chocolate cool a little too much I'm having trouble getting it integrated but people usually say a souffle doesn't have to be totally homogeneous it mostly just needs to be fluffy and I can see that I'm deflating this a bit so I'll stop in a sec mixing a viscous liquid with a foam absolutely does deflate the foam that much is not a myth into a buttered Ramekin with that now this one I'm just gonna blast with the beaters in 15 seconds it's as homogeneous as the other batter still being careful to not overdo it into the Ramekin with you I'll do the trick where you carve a little out of the edge of the batter this keeps the souffle from getting an unstable muffin top in the oven I could have been cleaner with that but fine folded souffle batter is on the right Bake at 400 Fahrenheit 200 C for 15 to 20 minutes until it's exploding out of the Ramekin and if anything the batter that we just blasted with the beaters is better I mean I tried to not beat the batter any smoother than the one that I folded but I did a little bit so the top is smoother and they both got the same exact amount of lift in the oven folding did nothing to preserve the bubbles now some very schooled pastry chef is probably already halfway through a comment saying this is an unfair test you didn't do the folding correctly and yeah maybe I didn't but if you have to be a schooled pastry chef in order to fold souffle batter in such a way that it beats simply beating it with the beaters then again I think the difference is de minimis home Cooks aren't going to do it perfectly so we might as well go with the easier option and folding ain't it of course there are other kinds of delicate Foams that we deal with in the kitchen not just meringue Not Just Whipped egg whites how about whipped cream Let's do an experiment with that we'll need something else more viscous to fold into our whipped cream so four of the egg yolks left over from our angel food cake tablespoon of flour like 10 grams and a quarter cup of cornstarch 30 grams pinch of salt three quarters of a cup sugar 150 grams we're going to need more liquid before we can mix this smooth splash of vanilla and I'll start drizzling in three cups of milk 700 mils just a little at first it's easier to whisk lumps out of a paste when it's really thick now I can get it all in turn on the heat and bring this to a boil classically you just heat the milk and use it to gently temper the eggs tempering is not bullish because people generally acknowledge that it's not necessary it just reduces the risk that you might curdle the eggs but if you whisk constantly and scrape down the sides in the bottom of the pan you can totally do this with everything mixed together at once over direct heat no tempering as it approaches the boil first the egg proteins coagulate and then the cornstarch will gelatinize followed by the wheat starch and I love how it's like somebody flipped a light switch suddenly we have a Luscious Pastry cream turn the heat off and then melt in two ounces 60 grams of butter we need to cool this all the way down and I don't have time to just let that happen naturally so big bowl with ice a few handfuls of salt and cold water the salt lowers the freezing point of the ice so we end up with super chilled liquid water just wrapping itself around the custard bowl and if I stir constantly this should be cool in minutes I've just got to stop before it starts freezing into starchy ice cream holy crap that is the best pudding you've ever had in your life Time to whip up a pint of cream just under 500 mils hey does it really have to be cold I've actually tested this one before Cold Cream does whip up faster but it doesn't whip up any better back in the day when you were doing this by hand anything that you could do to save a few Strokes was worth doing but it doesn't really matter these days that's where the the cream has to be cold rule comes from pretty much irrelevant now if you have a power tool okay that looks good now we're going to combine the whipped cream and the pastry cream equal parts by volume a cup of each into a bowl measure as precisely as I can now I'll do what convention dictates and gently fold these two together until I don't see any streaks of white left equal parts creme patissiere and whipped cream mixed together by volume equals creme Diplomat what a name if you taste it expecting to get mayonnaise you are in for a delightful shock this is a test of volume so let's scrape this out and measure it by volume looks like we're just shy of 450 mils okay grab another cup of whipped cream and a cup of pastry cream the ratio doesn't need to be perfect to taste good I'm just trying to standardize the experiments and instead of gently folding I'm going to beat this mercilessly until homogeneous took about 20 seconds let's measure its total volume people traditionally dip berries in creme Diplomat but I swear I would just eat a whole bowl of it now wait I gotta measure it before I eat it even minus that taste yeah it still looks like it's just Shia 450 mils any difference is de minimis so yeah I think folding might be bullsh you don't have to fold your foam gently with other ingredients you can just mix them really hard the normal way as long as you stop once they become homogeneous Lisa who sent me this email yeah I think you're right and I was wrong it takes a certain amount of agitation to homogenize a mixture and it doesn't seem to matter whether that agitation comes from folding or normal mixing please if you see somebody on the internet gently folding their ingredients do not tell them oh Adam or gusia says you're stupid this rule had to come from somewhere there may be some situations where folding really is advantageous I just have yet to identify what those are maybe you'll tell me in the meantime I've got all these delicious Foams now so it's time for some foam on foam action pretty nice but how about some hot foam on foam action that is out of control good recipes are in the description as usual however you mix your Foams give that combination there a try
White & dark chocolate mousse — no raw eggs,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lR8nisZUXWM/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLCGzywJusWwIMDSGBiybz4DbBLfhg,lR8nisZUXWM,"8 minutes, 58 seconds","Thank you #Noom for sponsoring today’s video!

My preview video about how a little fat will mess up egg foams: https://youtu.be/9...",29:02.6, here's an unconventional way of making a chocolate mousse the classic french recipe is based on raw eggs my eggs are fully cooked here and i actually think i prefer the taste and texture to the classic my version is also more stable you can make these days in advance and just pull them out of the fridge it's a perfect dinner party dessert and pretty quick to make get a little pot and crumble in a 4 ounce 113 gram chocolate bar as dark as you want it remember it's going to be diluted with cream and eggs so i would say start with chocolate that's pretty dark then just turn the heat on low and start it melting grab a couple eggs and crack them into a good size mixing bowl taking care to not puncture the yolks reach in fish the yolks back out again separating them from the white and dropping them into some temporary holding place remember that chocolate is usually melted before it looks all the way melted you won't know until you stir we don't want to let this burn or seize we just want nice smooth gently melted chocolate heat is still pretty low and now i'll whisk in my egg yolks once they're mixed in with the chocolate they are somewhat safe from curdling but we need to loosen this up to make it stirrable so i'm going to pour in some leftover coffee from this morning but you could use any watery liquid orange juice would be awesome brandy or milk or plain water just enough liquid to loosen this up so that you can whisk it smooth while the egg cooks a little which shouldn't take long when you see the egg thicken up a little bit you're good if you're not sure just stop stirring for a sec and see if the mixture bubbles a little if it does it is hot enough i'm using very dark chocolate and black coffee so i'm going to boost this with a couple teaspoons of sugar but that's to your taste whisk that in let it dissolve now i'll just scrape this chocolate base out into a bowl here where it can cool down before we mix it with everything else i'll throw the pot in the sink and let it soak because we'll need it again into a smaller mixing bowl i'll drop two thirds of a cup of cream 160 mls or thereabouts and i'll whip that up yes this is a dessert so it's lots of calories but it's an extremely fluffy dessert so much of the finished volume will be non-caloric air besides i have no problem eating an occasional dessert even though i am watching what i eat these days with the help of noom the sponsor of this video noom leverages the power of human

the cream before you over whip it into butter now is a convenient time to work in a little vanilla or a lot just mix that in now we need to whip the eggs so first we gotta wash these beaters even a little fat absolutely does weaken egg foams that's not a myth i proved that to you in monday's vid linked in the description i'll also wash that pot and while i'm here get a little fresh water in there doesn't have to be a precise amount because we're going to boil it back out again it's just there to dissolve this 1 3 of a cup granulated sugar about 70 grams with that i'll put a glug of corn syrup or any other invert sugar that'll keep the table sugar from recrystallizing and seasoning as we get this boiling with high heat while we wait i'll drop a little pinch of cream of tartar into the egg whites and start whipping the cream of tartar will stabilize the foam a couple of drops of lemon juice or vinegar would do the same this should only take like two minutes beat two pretty firm peaks those look good i'll pool the syrup to one side so i can more easily take its temperature looking for 240 fahrenheit 116 celsius it'll just be starting to go golden at the target temperature safely but swiftly i'll beat that into my egg whites drizzle a little in beat it for a second repeat until it's all in you can just dump it all in at once and beat but there's a risk that you'd fling syrup onto the side of the bowl where it would immediately cool and harden into crunchy little beads at this point the bowl should feel hot and you should smell the eggs cooking eventually it'll start looking glossy like marshmallow fluff which is exactly what this is aka italian meringue i love this stuff it's fully cooked and it's super stable it'll take days to collapse the meringue is done now but i want to keep beating it for a few more minutes just to cool it down i don't want it to be so hot that it instantly melts my cream when it feels lukewarm on my finger i'm good to beat in my chocolate mixture you don't have to gently fold this in the italian meringue can handle at least a little hard mixing before it deflates too much the chocolate is dispersed smoothly now time for whipped cream this i will also beat for just a second but you do have to be careful about deflating whipped cream just a second of beating and then i'll scrape down the bowl and finish the job with some gentle folding this is the finished product it's not going to bake in the oven or anything so if you see lumps now is your only chance to stir them out looks pretty great but if it doesn't look like chocolate mousse to you that's because it needs to chill thoroughly booze glasses of all kinds are perfect for this the only trick is you want to drizzle in the mousse without getting the rim of the glass dirty because it can be kind of hard to wipe clean without leaving a smudge we've got at least four generous dessert portions here but some of these i'm going to under fill for reasons if you want to smooth off the surface you can just swish the glass around a little doing this in a brandy snifter makes everything seem way classier than it is chill for at least a couple hours or ideally overnight plenty of time for me to do it all again with a white chocolate bar i'm not a huge white chocolate fan but this is really good another quarter pound 113 bar get it melting gently eggs into a mixing bowl fish out the yolks and reserve as soon as the chocolate melts smooth i'll whisk in my egg yolks when it looks too goopy to whisk i'll loosen it up with like a quarter cup of some watery liquid this time i am using amaretto almond flavored liqueur incredible flavor with chocolate but again you could use all kinds of things enough to make this whiskable now i'll whisk until i see the yolks just barely start to cook and thicken up if it doesn't happen you can turn the heat up a little bit but be conservative all of a sudden you'll see those egg proteins start to coagulate and then i'm done at the first sign of thickening you'll note this is pretty thin compared to our first one that's because it has no cocoa solids pour that somewhere it can cool no table sugar in the yolk mixture this time because white chocolate is super sweet and the amaretto is sweet two-thirds of a cup of cream 160 mls beet it always looks like nothing is happening until suddenly it happens that took four minutes stir in some vanilla just to put it somewhere where it won't get too hot and evaporate and also where i won't forget about it wash the beaters wash the pot grab a little water roughly equivalent to the one third of a cup of sugar we'll put in 65 to 70 grams plus a squeeze of syrup to prevent crystallization high heat while we wait dash of cream of tartar with the egg whites beat until we get pretty firm peaks two minutes max heat the syrup to 240 fahrenheit 116c and be very careful when you whip it in hot syrup will burn very badly if you splash it onto your skin the syrup cooks the egg whites keep whipping for a few minutes until they're not super hot anymore just lukewarm beat in the chocolate mixture until reasonably smooth drop in the whipped cream and only beat for a second scrape the bowl down and finish the job with a spatula gentle folding until smooth i'm not a white chocolate fan but with the amaretto i think this is even nicer than my dark chocolate mousse speaking of which it's now had a chance to firm up while i made my second flavor which means i can pour a second layer into the under-filled glasses and the first layer will hold firm got a nice clean line between the two strata now we've got enough dessert for like eight people and again it can just chill for a day or two until it's time to eat you should have just enough cream left over in the carton to whip up if you want a nice garnish i'd only do that for the all dark chocolate version these layered babies look great as is or you could try shaving on a little chocolate for garnish don't ask me how you avoid getting chocolate on the counter i do not know boy that is real nice and i do love that you get to arrange different combinations of the two flavors on the spoon heterogeneity you can see that we've got a nice fine bubble structure maybe it's a bit more dense than the classic made with raw egg foam but i like the slightly heavier mouth feel it's like fancy pudding with the coffee and the amaretto coming together but again that splash of liquid with the melting chocolate is a place where you can be creative and put in lots of different flavors try orange juice just because i'm weird and i don't like fruit flavors combined with chocolate doesn't mean you have to miss out

My old, non-traditional...",29:02.6, italian-american bolognese like i usually make is a very meaty tomato sauce but the traditional ragu from bologna has little if any tomato in it ragu a la bolognese is a very meaty milk sauce and it's generally served on fresh egg tagliatelle which we're gonna make without a pasta rolling machine do this on a weekend the sauce cooks for many hours i'm gonna make a smaller quantity today enough for four big portions but you could double or triple this and have sauce to freeze the traditional sauce usually starts with pancetta finely diced this is pretty expensive where i live you could skip it or you could use any other fatty unsmoked cured meat maybe 50 or 100 grams this is 3 ounces 85 grams i'm using my chrissy teigen pan but a dutch oven would be the classic choice especially for a larger quantity i would not use cast iron this is an acidic sauce that cooks for hours and you could definitely leech out some noticeable iron i'm just letting my pancetta slowly render out its fat as the pan heats up to medium and i dice two or three carrots just stir the pancetta every now and then to make sure nothing is burning you could totally chop your veg in a food processor or grate them but real bolognese from amelia romagna tends to be pretty chunky so this is great get it cooking in the rendered fat celery next i'm doing this in order of how long each veg takes to cook carrots take the longest slice these in the matchsticks and then cut across to get a nice coarse dice and i'll get them in the pan nice gentle heat nothing is supposed to brown yet i'll probably only need half this onion most traditional recipes i've seen use equal quantities onion celery and carrot i'd use about 100 grams of each for four portions of sauce in goes the diced half of onion and i think i'm going to need some more fat to get all of this veg cooked some people use olive oil but a big knob of butter is also traditional and it goes with the dairy theme okay for meat you can use any ground beef but the italian academy of cuisine prescribes beef from the plate section for bolognese that'd be like skirt steak best i could do was flank which is a neighboring cut and i'll grab no more than a pound of this it's not ground yet obviously but if i slice it real thin against the grain of the meat perpendicular to the extremely obvious meat fibers and then if i cut across those strips these should just fall apart into minced meat quite easily honestly i didn't even need to get them this fine this meat is going to cook for hours so even bigger pieces will just disintegrate something else the academy recommends is cooking the meat and the veg separately they say the veg should be sweated gently with no browning while the meat should be blasted brown so fine i'll get the meat in the now empty pan and then another common thing in emilia romagna is to use a mixture of beef and ground pork though obviously you could use all beef if you want also traditional to use veal i've got at least 500 grams of ground beef and pork combined in there so a little over a pound i'll turn the heat on high to get it browning you might get some initial browning right up front but then a ton of water is going to start pouring out of the meat and you have to evaporate that off before browning can resume that's fine gives you ample opportunity to break this up with a wooden spoon eventually the boiling will be over and you're going to start to hear and smell it frying a little bit don't go overboard a little browning will do it if you get every particle in here crunchy brown the sauce just tastes burned now for the only tomato in this sauce a big squeeze of tomato paste and that's it some traditional recipes use some pureed fresh tomatoes but again only a tiny bit the first written recipe for this sauce from the 18th century has zero tomato time to deglaze with a glass or two of dry white wine this is totally traditional this is not just me being me if you want to skip this use water and a splash of vinegar ideally white balsamic vinegar i would normally use a lot more white wine than that but i'm trying to keep it traditional today let's get the cooked vegetables back in notice there's no garlic most traditional recipes say no garlic it drowns out the other flavors they say all right i'm gonna give this a big pinch of salt to start with and a few grinds of pepper mostly because that'll make the smell better as it simmers for half a day the pepper will i'll grab a carton of chicken stock and get everything just submerged if you used plain water it really wouldn't be a huge difference and yeah simmer gently for at least two hours and potentially four or five i'ma have this with fresh pasta so that's a big carb bomb that i'm gonna need to offset with my breakfast from magic spoon the sponsor of this video the high protein grain grain-free child-like cereal for grown-ups who can't eat like children

they're shipping to the us canada and the uk now too thank you magic spoon so every now and then i'll just give this a stir to make sure nothing is sticking to the bottom and burning and i'll top it off with more stock the main reason to add the stock little by little is to make sure that you don't put in way too much if you do you'll have to boil out a whole ton of water before you can actually eat let me make my fresh pasta dough i do this in a bowl which i think is way cleaner than the traditional well method hey a double yolker i thought that egg looked big i usually figure one eggs worth of fresh pasta per person but you could be safe and go with three eggs for every two people if you want the pasta super yellow drop in an extra yolk or two makes it more kind of luxurious lately i've been adding like a teaspoon of olive oil per egg it makes the dough a little easier to roll out by hand maybe do a pinch of salt in there fresh pasta is hard to get fully seasoned by just salting the boil water and i'm really not sure why everything is beaten smooth and now you just stir in as much flour as the eggs will take which will usually be like half a cup 50 or 60 grams all-purpose flour per egg no point in measuring though it's just as much as you can get in when the fork becomes useless i'll go in with my hand when the dough feels not terribly sticky or messy anymore i might transfer it to the counter where it's just a little easier to knead but you don't have to get it all the way smooth and elastic yet just let it rest covered for at least 20 minutes here my sauce has been cooking for four hours it was edible hours ago but the long cook dissolves a ton of gelatin from the meat which gives this a luxurious texture and toward the end here i deliberately boiled most of the water out because i wanted to make maximum room in there for milk whole milk is traditional though you can use cream if you're feeling indulgent it's real good i don't know maybe a cup or two in there 300 mils or something enough to once more get everything just barely submerged this will look like dog vomit at this stage but keep the faith i think the reason most traditional recipes have you add the milk toward the end is we don't want all of the milk proteins to denature we want to simmer this super gently for 20 or 30 more minutes just to boil out some more water while still maintaining the natural emulsion of the milk that's to help hold the water and fat phases of the sauce together i've got some water coming to a boil for pasta and i've got ample time now to roll it out on the counter use plenty of flour to keep everything from sticking and just have at it with the rolling pin you do this with a rolling pin and it'll steam it first like it's never going to work just keep going little by little you'll see it'll stretch out you could use a rolling machine of course but once i stopped using my rolling machine i started making fresh pasta way more often i hate getting out the machine i hate cleaning it i hate finding a place to clamp it to the counter and it's a pain to run the pasta through without a second person to help you feed it as it gets longer and longer to me the rolling pin is just much simpler and more pleasurable give that sauce a stir don't want to let that milk get too hot and denature those proteins maybe i'll give this a flip just to make sure both sides are really well floured it's really tough to get pasta sheets super thin with just a rolling pin but i don't care i like my fresh noodles thick and chunky get this very well floured so that it does not stick to itself i'm draping this over itself a few times to make it easier to cut back on the cutting board and then the traditional shape for this sauce is tagliatelle wide ribbons the bologna chamber of commerce says these should be 6.5 to 7 millimeters wide when uncooked because of course the bologna chamber of commerce concerns itself with such things i guess i'm going a little wider than that so call it popper delay and you can sue me bologna chamber of commerce toss a bunch of flour over those to coat these sticky cut surfaces we just created and then tossed to separate and unroll all of the noodles if you were making these hours in advance you would need to drape them over something but since we're doing this when the sauce is almost done they can just sit in a pile for a few minutes the sauce no longer looks like dog vomit which is nice texture looks saucy but still pretty thick see how the spoon leaves a trail at the bottom of the pan i think that's perfect thickness time to taste for seasoning i think it's got plenty of salt from that carton of stock just need some more fresh ground pepper the earliest written recipe for this sauce calls for cinnamon but if any non-pepper spice is common these days in the traditional recipes it's a pinch of nutmeg which again goes with the dairy theme nutmeg is nice with milk alrighty i've got a big pot of water boiling i'll throw a handful of salt in there and drop in the noodles fresh pasta cooks in like two minutes but these are thicker noodles so i might give them three or four when you see them lighten in color they swell up a little bit they float enthusiastically they're cooked and you really don't have to nail the timing like you do with dried pasta i'll go strain these and ah that's hot nice one ragusia i won't quite drain this entirely a little starchy pasta water is good for the sauce early versions of this recipe use a little flour in the sauce probably to get a similar starchy texture we might need all of this sauce we might not so i like to add the sauce to the pasta and not the other way around that way i can add more as needed you never know until you get the sauce stirred through the best thing for dosing out a long pasta shape apart from one of those fancy pasta serving forks is tongs way easier way cleaner to drop the pasta down from above and that's it that's the traditional dish grating on cheese at the end is apparently frowned upon i might throw on some leaves from my celery as a garnish just because i have them and i love them but there you go how does it taste it to me it tastes like you could use some more wine and or tomatoes traditional bolognese is not acidic enough for my taste but i really like the dairy component contrary to what that scene in goodfellas would have me believe i'm honestly not sure i can taste the pork flavor mixed in with the beef but that honestly might just speak to the mild flavor of american pork i think i prefer my americanized chicken liver bolognese linked in the description the earliest written italian recipe suggests some chicken livers too by the way but hey this is good too a classic for a reason

bringing sexy beans this is episode one of a series where i'll be showing some bean recipes that should excite even a meat eater such as myself these i'm calling fire beans and they're exactly what they sound like fresh not dried lima beans charred with extreme high heat and then enrobed in a red chili sauce that sauce is a little much on its own but just right if you have this with rice make your rice however you want but here is my favorite way which many people find objectionable and i don't care a little hot oil in a pot dump in half a cup of dry unwashed rice per person for jasmine rice like i'm using here that's like 90 grams per person and then i'll stir and toast the rice over pretty high heat for a couple of minutes the free starch coat that we did not wash away browns a little and tastes really good this is the way you start risotto or paella and now i go back to normal plain rice technique dump in 1.5 parts of water to one part rice by volume no salt today because i'm going to have this with a heavily seasoned sauce asian style cover and bring to a boil hello reduce to a simmer and cover until the water is absorbed meanwhile beans about a pound 454 grams of fresh not dried lima beans butter beans they're also called all kinds of names and you can find them fresh in late summer or in the freezer section all year long the frozen ones are great dump them into plain water cover and bring to a boil which takes a while i'll eventually brown those in my widest cast iron the wider the better and you don't have to do this but i'm rubbing it down with a thin layer of oil so that i'll have a nice fresh seasoning coat after i preheat this in my outdoor gas grill i'm putting the heat on full blast you can totally cook this dish inside if you have a powerful stove and a really good ventilation system but if you do it outside all the smoke and the splatter stays outside closed to trap the heat all right my beans are boiling reduce those to a simmer and just cook until they're tender maybe 10 minutes when the rice has sucked in all the water i just turn off the heat and let it rest covered one bunch of green onions lose the roots and then i'll just slice these up into rounds the white and semi-white pieces are for the beans the green pieces i will set aside for the sauce just slice those up until you get to the really dry tattered parts at the end those are kind of stringy just toss them one fresh red chili or two if you're feeling dangerous take out the seeds and the ribs if you want to limit the heat or honestly you can just stop slicing when you get near the top a lot of the heat is up here these go into the pile for the beans grab some ginger a piece about yay big maybe cut the peel off no big deal if you don't get it all off i do think you want to slice it first against the grain of the fibers otherwise you get these long stringy fibers in your teeth chop that up and in the pile for the beans a few cloves of garlic peel and chop those go with the pile for the sauce they'd burn with the beans also for the sauce a handful of cilantro or really any fresh herb you want thai basil would be super nice and then the last thing for the sauce is a lime cutter in half for juicing let's fish out a bean and taste it real quick they should be just tender be careful to not let them go too soft or they will turn to mush in the cast iron follow me on instagram for more early drafts of recipes that look pre-digested you want to drain these really thoroughly let them steam off a little the drier they are on the surface the more you'll be able to char them later okay for sauce i'm going to start with like two teaspoons of corn starch and disperse that in a tiny splash of soy sauce or water whichever is nearby you can stir out the lumps much easier when it's a super thick slurry now my new favorite thing which is gochujang korean fermented chili paste any chili paste would work and i'm going to use like a quarter cup of it a giant scoop if you want this less spicy you could replace some or all of this paste with ketchup i won't tell now i'll put in our roughly equal quantity of soy sauce this is 60 mls or so that's a lot but it's the only source of salt in this entire dish including the rice then the lime juice you could just use half a lime if you don't want it too acidic i like the whole lime all of this stuff goes in the cilantro onion greens garlic i'll get that stirred in so that i can more easily measure the water by displacement enough water to give you like one and a quarter cups total sauce like 300 ml of sauce it should look a little watery at this stage remember it has the corn starch so it's going to thicken oh and you can put in a teaspoon or two of sugar if you want it'll balance the heat we need to mix the beans up in something and this is already dirty so there we go in goes the onions chili and ginger and then enough oil to make everything glisten i'm oiling the food not the pan because the pan is so hot that a film of oil would probably burst into flames if you think it's weird for me to be using olive oil with all of these asian flavors just know that i don't care olive oil is good i use it for basically everything but chocolate cake get every bean coated all right now i only have two things to carry out to the grill nice let's look at our pan white hot and not still smoking very much which is good if it was still smoking a lot that would mean my fresh seasoning coat has not formed yet you got to get all that stuff burned off and now keep your distance and just splash in the beans i will spread them out a little bit but i will not stir them not yet i want them to char on the bottom while there's still a ton of heat in the pan and not very much water leaking out yet once the water starts leaking out of the food it's going to steal the heat this step in my process i've taken from an excellent restaurant in louisville kentucky called mayan cafe they have a different charred lima bean dish that's one of the best things i've ever had you should go there and get it and as you can see we've got some nice char on the beans but they're not incinerated so perfect i'll stir things around now just to make sure that the onions and the chili get cooked there really won't be any more browning of the beans because water is coming out of the veg now and that's stealing the heat two minutes after everything went in i'll pour in my sauce the cornstarch should pretty much gelatinize on impact at these temperatures just stir for a minute or two until the sauce has almost reduced to a texture you like you got to account for further evaporation that will occur before you actually start eating make sure you've got heavy dry oven mitts this pan is extremely hot look already the sauce is a little too thick you can always water it down and now that it's in the house i'll taste it to see if it needs more of anything there's my clumpy toasty rice that some people consider heretical make your rice how you want but don't knock different things until you've tried them and slap those babies on hot sweet sour smoky umami it's all there and i love the creamy texture that fresh green lima beans have on the inside it's also a super meaty texture which makes this a very satisfying main dish full of protein and fiber and it's inexpensive for what

Thanks to Chef...",29:02.6, this is my new favorite thing to eat out of the house the most delicious rice with kimchi and korean barbecue and a crispy runny egg it's bibimbap as prepared by soul brothers a food stall at marble city market in knoxville tennessee they do a fusion of korean and southern u.s food i kind of grew up in a biracial family in east tennessee and it was kind of interesting to see how all of our friends would have all of these different dishes that we would actually want to make it home but we only had really korean ingredients so it was either korean or southern food with our with our father so we kind of just meshed the two together as we grew up chef josh coates is going to show us how he does the bat bowl at soul brothers and simultaneously i will show you a simplified version of the dish that i worked out at home my simplified home version is what you'll find in the description so bop is actually rice it's it in korean it translates to rice and bibimbap translates to mix mixed rice the whole idea behind the entire dish is that you have all these different fresh ingredients that you just mixed together first step obviously is to make rice they use short grain rice and they do it in a big professional rice cooker how should i cook my rice at home in a pot like i would say what the instructions say because i'm not entirely sure i've used one of these my whole life fair enough i've got half a cup 100 grams of short grain rice per person and i'm washing off the outer free starch coat swish and drain swish and drain and then i'll actually soak the rice in water for about a half hour this is common for korean style plain rice drain again and then put in the cooking water one to one water to rice is what works for me with my short grain rice but every rice is a little different no salt no nothing cover and bring to a boil then reduce the heat until it's not boiling over anymore and leave covered until everything is absorbed maybe 20 minutes total turn the heat off and then i like to let it rest for at least 10 minutes before fluffing resting gets you a product much closer to rice cooker rice now the real magic happens at soul brothers so what we use here is a jalapeno cilantro lime dressing just to kind of give it a little bit of a green fresh vibrant flavor which is not traditional but really just kind of adds a depth of flavor to the entire dish yeah to me this dressing is the defining feature of their dish amazing they start by removing the ribs and seeds from jalapenos so that's what i'm doing they do this in a food processor but i'ma just use a knife since i'm only making a little bit i'll start by dicing the pepper finely then i'll bring in a whole bunch of cilantro and start chopping all of that as fine as i can then i'll sprinkle over some coarse salt this will help me grind this down into a paste with the side of my knife then just stir in enough fresh lime juice to get a thick saucy texture i used three limes for this much stuff stir like a spoonful or two of that per portion into the rice right before you eat the green color will start to fade immediately on that hot rice so what goes on the rice here we have our marinade mushrooms these are actually done in our barbecue sauce that we use for our beef they obviously make their own marinade but for me imma just buy a prepared korean barbecue sauce marinade i'll chunk up some little brown mushrooms they saute the mushrooms at soul brothers but i'ma just simmer them right in the sauce korean barbecue has a lot of sugar so stir frequently or the sauce is gonna stick to the bottom and burn when the mushrooms have shrunk in half i'll pour them off those look a little too gooey for my taste so i'll water down the sauce a bit and done on the rice man i love barbecue flavors and so does brightland the sponsor of this video let me thank them check out the summer barbecue capsule they sent me nice tongs this box

link in the description and you'll save 10 percent on your order save 10 with my link in the description thank you brightland anyway the bop bowl from soul brothers after the mushrooms chef coats puts on the kimchi which of course they ferment themselves at the restaurant you salt the the cabbage draw out the moisture rinse all that salt off and then add kind of a mixture of and this is more of like each family has a different recipe for it but ours is garlic onion and ginger mixed with soy and gochugaru and a slurry of rice flour water salt and sugar and then let it ferment for about three days yeah i'ma just buy some kimchi at the store you can get it in mainstream us grocery stores these days usually in the cold produce section the real stuff has to be kept cold on the rice it goes up next are the bean sprouts this is a a variation of a korean banchon called kungnamur among bean sprouts that have been lightly blanched and then dressed with soy sauce sesame oil salt pepper and ginger garlic green onions okay so first thing i have to do is boil a bunch of mung bean sprouts that's twice as much as i need but if i cover it everything above the water should steam when people say blanch these that generally means boil them for a few minutes just until they start to visibly cook down a little this softens them a bit and kills surface bacteria which can be a problem with raw bean sprouts then you drain them and shock them with cold water to stop their cooking keep them crisp you can do that right in the pot as long as you kind of overflow it with enough cool tap water to suck all the heat out squeeze the water out and then rather than make a fresh dressing like they do at soul brothers i'm a lean on my store-bought ingredients i'll pour some of the excess juice off of my kimchi get that in there and then i'll dump in some more of my prepared barbecue sauce toss that around and that's good enough for me though i made way too many bean sprouts on the rice with that next thing they put on at the restaurant are some korean style quick pickled cucumbers it's actually a korean pickle and a korean uh cucumber kimchi kind of combined into one so it's gonna have very bright vibrant flavors of like rice wine vinegar sugar salt there's a little bit of gochugato in there for just a touch of heat i will once again be simplifying things considerably i'm just cutting some of the peel off of this cucumber and then i'll cut these into semi-circles and again i'll cheat by just pouring off some excess juice from my store-bought kimchi great stuff maybe i'll top this off with a little rice vinegar and then i'll mix in a big pinch of sugar the cucumbers at soul brothers are sweet i leave this in the fridge for a few hours or overnight and the sugar will pull a ton of water out of the cucumbers they will look and feel like pickles they are pickles back at the restaurant it's time to cook the bulgogi beef you could obviously skip this and just make extra mushrooms this is very thinly sliced beef marinated overnight in their house-made barbecue sauce which is soy brown sugar just like the same marinade with the mushrooms with ginger garlic green onion and asian pear to kind of help tenderize it asian pear contains enzymes that break down the meats a little bit we'll get a nice char on there and generally bulgogi in korean translates to fire meat it normally be done over an open flame but even if not over an open flame our parents cooked it in a skillet so it just how whatever works for you guys okay well i was able to buy the same beef cut that chef coats uses top round i believe the brits call it top side strong beefy flavor it's often sold thin sliced like this great for stir fry as long as you slice it very thinly against the grain of the meat the grain is super obvious so that's easy slice perpendicular to the grain and you'll end up with very short meat fibers and therefore tender pieces all kinds of thin sliced beef would be fine and i have way more than i need here you just need like a handful of this per person chef coats kind of chops up the slices on his flat top grill as he's cooking them i will not be able to do that in my pan so i'm going to shorten these slices now just to make them easier to eat and i will simply coat this in my store-bought bulgogi marinade which has those same tenderizing enzymes in it marinade at least two hours but i did overnight into a very hot oiled pan i wish i had blotted those dry a little but whatever i can evaporate the water just don't burn the sugar in the marinade and we are also going to do a sunny-side up egg with this that just sits right up on top so he gets the egg going right after he gets the beef going and he does it in some oil and pretty high heat the white is really fluttering because he wants a crispy egg brown and crispy on the bottom but a runny yolk on top i'm gonna do this in a separate pan while i do my beef heat should be high enough that the white flutters on impact if the pan's not hot enough the yolk will be solid by the time the bottom is crispy the beef is done at soul brothers gorgeous on the rice it goes the egg is done and look how hard he has to scrape to get it off his grill that's easy to do on a big flat top much harder to do in a little pan which is why i'm using a non-stick pan no scraping my beef is brown so on it goes with pieces this small they're done on the inside when they're visibly brown on the outside and there goes my egg on top now at the restaurant they put on two sauces the first being a kimchi aioli or mayonnaise koreans don't really use kimchi aioli but we do we'll use three raw eggs with like a cup of kimchi and then we actually add gochujang in there some gochugaru a little salt pepper lime juice to kind of give it that extra sour uh and to help the emulsification process and mix in oil as it blends everything smooth and then you get kimchi healthy and then the last sauce that we're going to put over it is our bob sauce so this one's actually a little bit different from normal uh bibimbap sauce we actually use our pork marinade which is going to be a mixture of sugar rice wine vinegar gochujang asian pears uh garlic green onion and ginger uh and then we actually add more gochujang to that with some sesame oil so that we can make this nice thicker sauce to kind of go over top of our bot bowl absolutely beautiful but as you can imagine i'm not going to do all that work i'm just going to grab some store-bought goju-chong which is korean fermented chili paste they have this in the asian section at my normal grocery you could just use that straight but imma mix it with some ketchup at soul brothers they're mixing it with a bunch of sweet and sour ingredients well guess what ketchup is ketchup is originally asian some soy sauce in there and i think that's a pretty darn good condiment i'll drizzle that over my bowl and i'm skipping the aioli entirely last thing at the restaurant is some shake on seasonings two parts to our furakaki which is literally just a rice seasoning it's gonna be salt sugar gochugaru and sesame seeds white and black that we use for a rice seasoning so one shaker has the seeds the other shaker has salt sugar and korean chili powder gochugaru i'll just sprinkle on a pinch of salt a pinch of sugar pinch of any chili powder and i do have a bottle of mixed black and white sesame seeds that i use for all kinds of things because they're pretty and that's it boom then you just pop open the egg to form a little sauce you start mixing and matching ingredients with each bite heterogeneity is mine as good as the one from soul brothers absolutely not mine is good but theirs is transcendent worth a special trip to marble city market in downtown knoxville tennessee where you will find soul brothers and lots of other good places to eat but hey you make your bop bowl with anything you want anything you've got that's the traditional way it's kind of like the korean version of like a kitchen sink dish it's literally everything kind of goes into inside of it so even if you're at home and you don't have like access to some of these ingredients you would literally just anything that you had you could use cabbage like fresh cabbage our parents put lettuce in there you could use raw onions even cilantro in some cases and then if you had like tofu at home and you wanted to fry that off you could use that as well and it doesn't even have to have meat at all you could actually just put the vegetables over top of it throw an egg on it and mix the whole thing together with the sauce that we're going to put over it indeed rice with stuff that basic concept has fed half of humanity for thousands of years you can only go so wrong with it

***RECIPE***

potatoes (1/2 lb, 227g per person, I like Yukon Golds)
fat/oil (I...",29:02.6, rusty is a national dish of switzerland particularly german speaking switzerland it's a breakfast it's a side dish it's just a potato pancake potatoes salt fat that's it but there are so many slight differences in technique people use and right now i'm going to try almost all of them this is rusty eight slightly different ways number one parboiled this method seems to have particular traditional cred in switzerland boil the potatoes until they've softened a bit on the inside but they're still going to be firm enough that you can grate them later i can sink my knife in there but they still resist a fair bit i think if i cook them any farther than that they're just going to crumble into mash when i grate them a lot of recipes tell you to chill them overnight in the fridge before you grate them which is exactly what i did now every traditional recipe i've seen tells you to peel the potatoes and i don't care people should eat more potato skin it's the most nutritious part of the potato and if you're using a variety with thin skin you probably won't even notice it in there there is zero point in peeling these yukon gold potatoes i'm using large holes on a box grater now people commonly squeeze out some of the excess water after they've graded pretty standard like american style hash brown technique but when you parboil the potatoes there really isn't that much to squeeze out cooking them dried them out even though we used a wet heat method i'll sprinkle some salt on there and toss raw weight on these potatoes was about one pound 454 grams for a small roosti that's an 8 inch 20 centimeter diameter nonstick real small for fat i'm using clarified butter but you could use anything just be generous with it if you want really golden surface on this in go the potatoes i'll push them into a nice even layer and then a small one like this will probably take 10 minutes on side a medium medium low heat you need the whole cake to cook to the point where it kind of melts into itself and it's solid enough to flip the danger is usually that you'll overcook the bottom before it's ready to flip so be conservative with the heat i'll flip by just covering it and then turning it out not bad maybe a little more fat in the pan then slide her back in to brown side b you can kind of set that round shape by just swishing it around in the pan just cook until the other side is golden and the whole thing feels reasonably solid i gave it maybe eight minutes on that second side and i'll turn it out to a cooling rack so it can steam out a bit before i cut it you'll get cleaner slices if you really let it cool i should have let this cool a little bit more and there it is let's taste pretty nice i like the slightly fluffy texture it has in the center from the par boiling it's just on the verge of becoming mashed potatoes nice okay roosty number two not parboiled totally raw potatoes as i grate them they feel much wetter and now when i go to squeeze out the water wow so much is coming out i'm not even squeezing that hard big difference from the parboiled potatoes i think if you spread them out it's much easier to eyeball the salt even so that was probably a little too much salt there tossed to combine plenty of clarified butter in the pan and i'll cook these as before so far this is a lot easier than the parboiled method because i didn't have to parboil them and then wait overnight it's starting to feel solid enough to flip give a peek on the bottom uh oh i think this is going to be too dark yeah a little too dark i think the residue of starchy water on these pieces browns very easily i'll be a little more conservative with my heat on side b tidy up the shape 15 to 20 minutes of total cook time much nicer on that side and it feels crispier than the first one again i think because of that starchy residue [Music] as chef john would say fork don't lie oh it's cutting easier too very very crispy hey i hope everybody who

is better on the outside i think but i'm not wild about the inside it's a little slimy in the center again i think from that wet starchy residue we can try to address that with rusty number three rinsed not parboiled again raw potatoes grate them up and then i'll grab a bowl of cool tap water hot water might gelatinize the starch make it all gummy wow you can see how much free starch is washing off the surface of the shreds i'm actually going to drain that in the sink and then rinse it again in some fresh water much cleaner now i didn't invent this by the way lots of recipes tell you to wash off that free starch squeeze the water out sprinkle on some salt toss wow these feel so different almost like coarse hair very clean and separate shreds i'm concerned that they won't bind together as they cook that starch glue probably functioned as a binder in our last one indeed after about 10 minutes that's feeling too loose to flip i'll give it a few more minutes to kind of melt together but now yep i think i burned it i guess if you're going to wash off the starch you got to be even more conservative with the heat give it plenty of time to cook together before the surface burns i'll give it medium low heat on side b and much nicer there not as crispy though again i think that starch goo we washed away was a big part of why we got such a nice crispy surface last time though this is not bad give it a taste yeah i think i prefer the interior texture on this one it's not slimy again because we washed these shreds i think there's a way we can get the best of both worlds but first with rusty number four i want to try cutting the potatoes into matchsticks rather than grating them i've seen fancy chef people do this they say these longer pieces kind of wrap around each other and hold the cake together better plus it probably looks nicer i can already tell you i do not have the knife skills to get these as skinny as they need to be because the pieces are bigger they have less surface area so these are bleeding less water which is bad we need to dry them out a bit and i can't squeeze anything out of them so we're going to need some chemical pressure i'll salt these and then let them sit for like a half hour now the salt has drawn out a fair bit of water and i can squeeze these pretty dry in the pan they go they really feel like noodles now it's weird and i'm turning the heat down because i can already predict this is going to need some extra time the pieces are bigger it's going to take longer for them to all cook into each other and get this solid enough to flip and i still burned it nice i'll do a better job on side b yeah this is not working it's like a pile of worms not a cake if you've got ninja knife skills or if you've got a mandolin slicer maybe you can get these into the super fine matchsticks required but nah i'm going back to the grater rusty number five grated rinsed and baked i'm gonna rinse these in some clean water but i'm not gonna rinse them as thoroughly as i did before there's really no point a quick dip gets most of that free starch off and i'm not sure i want to get it all off anyway squeeze it dry season in the pan and this time i'm just gonna worry about browning the bottom that's all after like five minutes the bottom looks good and i'll transfer this to the oven 350 fahrenheit 180c maybe 10 minutes this gives us plenty of time to cook down the potatoes make them hold together even without that free starch glue we washed away and in the oven there's much less risk of burning the bottom bottom looks perfect a little bit more butter in there to brown the flip side again i'm just going to worry about browning the bottom the interior is basically cooked i could call this done but for some extra textural contrast i'll throw that whole rack back into the oven to crisp up the outside and push the inside a little closer to mashed potato territory my convection fan is on by the way let's give that a shot probably my favorite one so far pretty crispy on the outside and not at all slimy on the inside good rusty number six rinsed greased and baked this is going to be the same as the last one except after i get my shreds rinsed and dried i will toss them with a little bit of my clarified butter along with the salt lots of recipes tell you to spread some fat through the pieces no doubt this will help the cake hold together and to cook faster i will put a little less fat into the pan to compensate don't want this too greasy brown the first side transfer to the oven until it feels solid enough to flip brown the other side optionally return it to the oven on the rack for extra crisping and i don't think i like that very much the fat on the inside just makes the whole thing super greasy not a fan one more variable i want to test rusty number seven mealy potatoes or baking potatoes these are russets and these i will peel these have very thick cardboardy skins the skins crisp up really great but the wet bits of skin in the interior would be kind of gross up to this point i've been using yukon golds which are an amazing variety that we have here in the united states it's halfway between a waxy potato and a mealy potato waxy potatoes hold their shape when cooked mealy potatoes don't and i want to try mealy potatoes rinse squeeze season brown bake flip brown bake again and if you were to use these more floury potatoes i think you'd want to cook them a little bit less the interior is straight mashed potatoes they've totally fallen apart inside there was no point in grating these i could have just fried some mashed potato cakes which is a thing that i do sometimes okay i think i'm ready for my final draft rusty number eight i'm gonna do a much bigger one now three pounds of potatoes 1.4 kilos i'm using a mixture of russets and yukon golds because that's all i have left rinse squeeze season and this time i'll use my 10 inch 25 centimeter cast iron skillet plenty of clarified butter in there cast iron is not as nonstick as teflon is get all that in there cook until things are looking golden on the bottom transfer to the oven probably for 20 minutes this time there's just a lot more mass in there feels plenty solid enough to flip i'll shake this really hard to make sure it's gonna release when i flip cast iron is not as nonstick as teflon wow really nice color on that slider back in brown the bottom another good five minutes at least turn her out and again that's probably good enough but i will put the rack back in the oven for a final crisping the oven is already hot so might as well turn it out let it cool the thicker the roostie the harder it is to get really clean slices the crispy crust kind of caves in on the soft interior if you want really clean slices do a thin one again people eat these with eggs or as a starch accompaniment to a stew i'm just gonna garnish with sour cream and dill and call it a day you know people have asked me if i might show my whole recipe development process and there i just did but honestly every version i just tried right now was pretty good and the differences between them were not enormous so you know cook your potatoes however you want it'll probably be fine

stackable burger patty requires totally different technique as compared to a thick boy most of all a thin patty requires ridiculously high heat we're going to do some out on the grill and inside in a pan the name of the game here is get the outside of the patty really dark brown before the inside gets horribly overcooked and coating the meat in oil will help transfer heat to the crust you could use any grease you want but i'm using clarified butter because beef plus butter equals happiness that's just science put a stick of butter in a little pot over pretty low heat let it melt and boil off most of its water 10 or 15 minutes when the bubbling turns to fizzing and the milk solids start to just turn golden i'll strain this through a paper towel the milk solids we're trapping would certainly have burned at the insane temperatures we're going to use later this part you also don't have to do but it really helps i'm cutting a parchment paper square for each patty that i plan to cook this is just ground chuck the classic burger cut but anything that's at least 20 fat will work and with thick burgers i want to avoid working the meat i want to maintain that open crumbly texture on the inside but with a thin burger it's the exact opposite i'm literally going to knead the meat try to get it to where it looks kind of pasty this tangles up all the proteins and makes the texture of the burger much more solid and tighter with a thick burger that gets you a rubbery texture but with a thin burger the kneading helps the patty hold together thin patties are very apt to break apart especially out on the grill this makes them more solid and the toughness doesn't really matter with a thin patty since it's going to be brittle in the mouth no matter what you do if you buy ground beef that's vacuum packed in a super tight block you can skip this step it's already pasty in there a good size for a homemade thin burger is a quarter pound 113 grams which is basically the size of a really big meatball if you form this into balls first that helps you portion out all the meat and these will be easier to mash into circles here's my clarified butter and i'm gonna dip my balls in it this is honestly the easiest way to get the whole surface of the burger coated in grease plus it means that the meat won't stick to my fingers as i smash it out into a circle on its individual parchment square as with any burger it's good to make it thicker along the rim that will slow the cooking along the rim where it gets more heat keep it from contracting too much and causing a hump to develop in the center of the burger i'll season with pepper and my favorite burger seasoning garlic powder but no salt yet salting ground beef in advance gets you a very unburger like texture shape these patties considerably wider than you want them in the end thin burgers shrink a ton as they cook you want to see how much they shrink there that's how much follow me on instagram for more hot pulsating meat content pepper and garlic powder and because these are on paper i can just stack them here i'll press out all the rest at once so i can go back and season them all at once less hand washing that way by the way certain commenters just because i don't show myself washing my hands in the videos doesn't mean i don't wash my hands do you really want to see the like 30 or 40 times i wash my hands over the course of a shoot you might have to warm up this butter if you're doing a lot of burgers the cold meat cools it down and it goes solid yes i'm only seasoning one side of the burgers i'm not bothering to peel them off and season the other side i did a side by side test with a burger this thin i could not tell the difference between one i seasoned lightly on both sides versus the one that i seasoned heavily on one side and this is why the paper is so great burgers this thin and wide occupy a huge amount of horizontal space for not much food if you put them on paper you can stack them without sticking them together keep these cold and they'll be less likely to fall apart when you transfer them to the heat i'll prep some toppings a sweet onion wow did certain people lose their minds the other week when i put raw onions on a burger dude cook your onions if you want to you just probably want to do it in advance so you're not juggling too many things at the end some lettuce pickles ketchup and mustard i'm good we need stupid high heat and a simple charcoal grill is the easiest way to get stupid high heat at home filler up natural chunk charcoal burns a little hotter than reconstituted briquettes but it's not a huge difference a bundle of paper towel makes a great kindling and if you grease it up there's no way it can fail even in the wind it acts like an oil lamp starter on top lighter up and in 15 minutes everything in here will be white hot that right there is enough to cook a few burgers but if you need the heat to last longer you can drop a fresh layer of charcoal on top just spread it out nice and even or some areas will end up being way hotter than others give the grill grates a few minutes to heat up before you scrape off any leftover sludge let it burn off and when it's time to lay on the burgers peel them halfway off the paper first otherwise you end up having to do that and that's not super safe peel them halfway off and then you can just plop them down real easy much safer than trying to do this with your bare hands now is a convenient time to finally season these with salt and now is when i run inside and wash my hands real quick because these will be ready to flip in like 90 seconds yes there's lots of flame-ups happening no it doesn't really matter because this happens so quickly when there's juice pooling on top it's time these are probably past time scrape underneath to release and then flip you got to do that scraping maneuver swiftly and with confidence and if you want cheese put it on immediately after you flip there's a reason people generally use processed american cheese slices for thin burgers it's really the only thing that melts fast enough though if you want to make this a double you can stack them and then the cheese gets heat from both sides i prefer to have only one slice of cheese per two patties anyway that's more than enough cheese for me with a burger this thin it is virtually impossible to get it brown on the outside and have it be undercooked inside when it's brown it's done or it will be done after it rests for a minute i actually overcooked these because it's basically impossible for me to film something that cooks so quickly and not overcook it while i'm resetting my camera angles i like to rest my burgers on a plate so excess juice does not soak into my buns speaking of buns they will need like 15 seconds to toast up on a fire this hot be very careful and there i still burned that one i like a slice of lettuce to serve as a moisture barrier on the bottom mayonnaise serves the same function if you like mayo raw sweet onions mustard ketchup and look at that yes there's a point to making two thin patties instead of one thick one we get double the crusty surface area this way i have less than zero interest in a burger that has no pickles but you do you now because i was filming and that slowed me down a little bit i definitely cooked these like 30 seconds too long but regardless thin burgers are going to be gray on the inside there is no way to make one that is crusty on the outside and pink on the inside if you want that style make a thick burger i have a recipe in the description let's do one inside in the kitchen you'll need your widest pan cast iron is a great choice since we need something that can retain a lot of heat and on my gas stove it's maximum high heat on my old electric stove which was more powerful i would use medium high every stove is different every pan is different and you just gotta learn yours you want the highest heat that won't immediately burn the meat if you're using cast iron you want to see the residues inside it's smoking and speaking of smoke i am only doing this inside because i am lucky enough to have a very effective ventilation system if you don't i would say don't make thin burgers at home inside either make them outside or make thick burgers because you can cook those much more slowly at a lower heat now i'm pressing those into the surface a little bit to make sure there isn't a steam bubble that's going to keep the center from touching the pan and browning but note these are not smashed burgers smashed burgers are a totally different technique and we'll try that another day season these with salt again if you see juice pooling on top that means the core of the burger is starting to cook it's time to flip give it a good scrape before you flip there you can see another disadvantage of doing these inside even with my widest pan i have barely enough space to cook two thin patties at a time which is one portion there's a reason burger joints use massive flat top griddles you can buy a home griddle but make sure it's one that gets really really hot i put on my cheese immediately after the flip i'll stack these up to help it melt i've got some room in there for the bun which again will take seconds in this heat get everything out and honestly if you want cooked onions there's so much heat in here you could get them pretty brown in like a minute lettuce onions mustard and ketchup i like to put the condiments on the bottom so they hit your tongue first as you eat and look at that glorious stack with the clarified butter crust on it not something you want to eat every day but once in a while it's pretty much the greatest thing ever maybe not a thing

that's baked in a wide pan a dutch baby the origin of the name is disputed this is a savory dutch baby that i think is really good but first i'm going to show you the traditional sweet version any popover is basically just a very wet unleavened pancake batter that steams up a ton in the oven and pops over the rim of the pan they steam up bigger if that batter is warm before it goes in the oven so i'm warming my refrigerated eggs for a minute in hot tap water works like a charm just needs a couple of minutes likewise my cold milk all warm in the microwave the traditional ratio is one third of a cup 80 mils per egg so i've got two thirds of a cup here microwave it for like 30 seconds you don't want it so hot that it cooks the eggs prematurely this batter needs to be very well mixed so people generally make it in a blender i hate getting out my blender so a whisk in a bowl crack in the eggs savory or sweet i'd say a big pinch of salt per egg i'm doing half a teaspoon of my kosher salt a quarter teaspoon per egg maybe a teaspoon of sugar per egg which is very little we'll be putting sugar on top later and purely for the sweet recipe i'll do a glug of vanilla beat that until the eggs are really loose and frothy kind of like that for flour the traditional ratio is also a third of a cup per egg 40 grams of flour per egg however i have found that i get a much nicer texture if i replace up to half of my flour with starch cornstarch any starch this probably makes the final product a little less poofy but it makes it more tender and nicer to actually eat in my opinion i like to whisk that in before i whisk in my milk when it's nice and thick like that it's easier to whisk out the lumps now the milk i'll gradually whisk in you get a bigger rise and a smoother surface if you really mix this batter thoroughly which is why people use the blender it's very similar to crepe batter and like crepes you want to let the batter sit for at least 20 minutes let the particles hydrates let the proteins auto lice and the batter will be much more elastic and able to blow up like a balloon now is when i will put my pan into the oven and get the oven heating to 425 fahrenheit 220c you could heat the pan on the stove instead but this is more efficient when it's really hot it should melt butter enthusiastically like that this is traditionally done in cast iron but i find i can get away with less butter in a non-stick get that batter in before the butter burns and say that three times fast the batter should look watery water equals steam this is a 10 inch diameter pan 25 centimeters you could do a three egg pop over in a pan this size maybe four but i prefer a thinner product close the oven and try not to open it until everything is puffy and golden brown that took about 20 minutes you want to keep the heat and the steam in there or the baby will collapse and collapse it shall when you take it out no matter what you do the steam will subside the pancake will deflate so now is when you want to document this for the gram which we all know is what cooking is really about since we did this in a non-stick i should be able to just lift it and bam thank you new and improved non-stick pan from mizin sponsor of this video misen makes inexplicably high quality cookware for the budget prices they charge and this non-stick is no exception it has a three layer dupont platinum coating which is their most scratch resistant coating two and a half times more non-stick than other pans that cost twice as much there's also a plasma primer layer underneath to keep the coating in place this should last a very long time even if you use it in the oven the handle is oven safe and like all knees and pans it feels really comfortable and solid in the hand which i think is really important i think we reach for the tools that feel good to hold follow my link in the description and use promo code adam regucia for 20 off your first order on this pan or anything they got a ton of great pans hit my link use code adam ragusia all one word you'll save twenty percent thank you mizin i suggest pulling this out to a cooling rack so the bottom doesn't get soggy and a traditional way to top a sweet dutch baby is with a squeeze or two of lemon and then a lot of sugar and you could just tear at it to eat it or you could be civilized and cut it into wedges people top these with all kinds of things whipped cream fruit whatever you want those are cherries and the pancake itself is crispy on the outside and kind of custardy on the inside it'll be more custardy if you do a thicker one honestly dutch babies are a little bland and kind of chewy for my taste i kind of think they only exist for instagram so with the savory recipe i set out to make a dutch baby that i would actually want to eat two eggs big pinch of salt per egg a teaspoon of sugar per egg even for the savory recipe that's not enough to turn this into dessert it just kind of makes the taste come alive no vanilla this time whisk until frothy a third of a cup 40 grams of flour per egg again i'm replacing almost half of my flour with cornstarch to tenderize the final product whisk until smooth and then slowly whisk in warm milk a third of a cup 80 mls per egg and then something that really improves the flavor is a spoonful of any soft spreadable cheese i'm using ricotta but i bet you could use brie or mascarpone this would be good in the sweet recipe as well the baby won't puff up quite as much with cheese in it but again it's gonna collapse no matter what you do before you actually eat it and i'm trying to cook for the plate not for the gram nice and smooth and let that sit for at least 20 minutes some people let the batter sit overnight oven again at 220 celsius 425 fahrenheit heat the pan with the oven melt in a good layer of butter and pour in the batter right away we got to get this boiling on the inside before the outside is set and can no longer expand if the thing doesn't expand at all in the oven it's going to be gummy on the inside while i wait i'm going to prepare some savory toppings i've got one green onion which i will slice at an extreme angle lots of things taste oniony but green onion pulls double duty as a garnish it's crunchy and green and pretty i'm going to bake a couple of eggs on top and i'm going to crack them in advance and even season them in advance this way i can just slide them on top when it's time that's harissa powder by the way fantastic with eggs and i've got a couple of slices of fancy salami but you could use all kinds of things anything that works as a pizza topping will work here wait until the baby is basically done it needs time to puff up before we weigh it down in the middle maybe pull it when it's a hair underdone and real quickly before it cools down too much i'll slide on my eggs scatter on my onions and then tear on my salami i can put a strip straight down the middle to keep the eggs separate back in the oven for maybe five minutes until the eggs are done to your liking you can just poke them to assess how firm they are but keep in mind they'll keep cooking a little as this cools again i can lift this right out to a rack if you're using a cast iron pan just melt some extra butter onto the bottom and you should be fine once the bottom has steamed out more or less i'll cut this up i don't want to break the egg yet so i'll cut one giant slice and then serve a second smaller slice on the side for dipping that's really quite a bit easier than breakfast pizza and good enough to actually eat unlike most dutch babies dutch in this context is probably an anglicization of deutsche by the way so it's the germans who should be offended if anyone

***RECIPE***...",29:02.6, if you've ever had really crispy crunchy french toast at like a restaurant they probably put some kind of crumb coating on it or they deep fried it or both i did not deep fry these but i did do a crumb coating and they are crispy af and yet not at all greasy inside you can make french toast with any bread but i'm not alone in thinking that brioche or chala are the best options both styles of bread have egg and the egg keeps the bread from just dissolving and going mushy when soaked in custard this is brioche nice thick slices traditionally french toast is made with day-old bread and you could just leave these slices out overnight to stale but according to my experiments it works just as well to toast the bread with really low heat it isn't the stalin per se that improves french toast it's really the drying i need to heat my oven for this recipe anyway so i've just put my bread straight onto the bars and now i'll turn the heat on something moderate 350 fahrenheit 180c something like that i might flip them after a few minutes i'm not looking to really brown these i just want them dry and they'll dry some more as they cool and steam off for a few minutes you can fry french toast in any fat including butter but in my experiments it really comes out better with clarified butter i've got a stick 113 grams in a little pot should be enough to fry six pieces literally just turn the heat on low and let it sit for about 10 minutes it'll melt then boil off most of its water then it'll start fizzing and the milk solids will kind of curdle and eventually start turning golden it'll start to smell like caramel and that's it you can strain it through a paper towel to make it extra squeaky clean but most of the milk solids will just get caught in the sieve you can of course buy clarified butter or ghee from an indian grocery but we'll use all of that for just this breakfast clarified butter by the way gets a more even and lighter golden crust than whole butter would the milk solids tend to overcook i think you'll need at most one egg for every two pieces i usually use half that it depends on how custardy you like your french toast and if you're going for a sweet breakfast vibe you could throw in like a teaspoon of sugar per egg and maybe a splash of vanilla oh and a little pinch of salt mostly to help the egg thin out though if i was using unsalted butter i would use two pinches now a roughly equal quantity of milk or cream i did a side by side test and cream really does taste a lot better surprise surprise so i'm doing cream you really gotta stir this smooth if the egg is still all thick like that it's gonna have trouble absorbing into the bread really bash it with a fork or a whisk until the custard is nice and smooth oh and one other thing if you want it cinnamon it doesn't really dissolve in there it just kind of floats that's fine pour that into some kind of walled flat vessel a cake pan works really well too i'll grab another plate and pour on my crumb coating corn flake crumbs would be traditional and they have a nice flavor but no substance on earth is as crispy as panko maybe a cup of that one thing i like to do is grind the panko down with my hands a little bit i don't want a super coarse crumb stabbing me in the mouth yes panko is still crispier than other breadcrumbs even if you grind it down a little alrighty there's my dried and cooled bread and my clarified butter we're ready and everything up to this point you could do the night before breakfast you could cook this in any pan but if you use a non-stick you can get away with using only a very thin film of clarified butter minimizing that fat is good when we're frying something as absorbent as dried bread that thin film should lubricate things as effectively as the sponsor of this video lubricates my experience of the internet i'm talking about surf shark let me thank them say you want to buy something on the internet but

not want the interior to be wet i just get the outside wet and then dip this straight into the bread crumbs by the way don't try to put cinnamon or other spices in the breadcrumbs they're liable to burn in there the cinnamon will be somewhat protected underneath the crumbs i'd mop up the butter with the toast a little bit just to make sure you've got a nice even layer of fat down there to fry the surface you want a nice gentle sizzle this is like medium low on my stove first side should only need a couple of minutes and when it's time to flip you might be tempted to use tongs but they tend to crush the bread irreparably at this stage so i use a spatula even though it's kind of awkward again i'd move things around just to mop up some of that butter if you don't the bottom tends to brown unevenly and i often find that i need to reduce my heat slightly at this stage the browning can get out of hand really fast that one's a little too dark and that one's a little too light once you've got the outside somewhat crispy and firm you can start flipping frequently which is good because then there's no surprises i can give that one the heat that it needs and this one i think is done when you've done just a quick dip in the custard the toast is done when the outside looks done you don't have to worry about the inside getting cooked let it drain and cool on a rack and it'll stay crispy for a long time another bonus of using a thin film of butter or oil is that i can just wipe this out with a paper towel now i don't have to worry about trying to fish out all those burned bits before i fry my next batch i'm gonna start fresh with a new film of clarified butter this batch i'll do more the way i like it which is to let the bread really soak up some custard how long it will take will depend on the bread and how dry you got it but i let these soak a couple of good minutes to the point where i could feel the bread going soft again near its core it's still a little firm it's not totally soaked through some people like it totally soaked through i've heard about people leaving the bread submerged overnight these are not going to be that custardy inside but they're still going to be more custardy than the batch i fried for lauren nice light crumb topping nice gentle sizzle in the pan and if you've soaked your bread through you've got to worry about cooking the inside not just the outside there's a real risk the outside will be burned by the time the inside custard is set so either you can take your heat way down low and just cook these very slowly in the pan or you can do what is my preference which is to quickly brown the outside just as we did before a couple of minutes on each side look you can see that piece puffing up that's the extra moisture on the inside steaming up it still feels a little squishy and raw on the inside so i will remove these to the rack and i will finish cooking them in my moderately hot oven you can just throw the rack in there if it's heat safe the earlier batch too with the panko crumb on it you can make a ton of french toast in advance and then crisp it back up in the oven right before everybody eats if anything it'll be even crispier so now i've got five or ten minutes where i can clean up and maybe whip some cream we already have cream for the custard just whip it on low speed for a couple of minutes until it starts to thicken up then you can boost the power without it splashing the trick with whipped cream is to stop whipping right before it goes from being smooth and silky like that to being kind of rough and cheesy and there i crossed the line nothing to be done about it it's still going to taste great especially if i put in a handful of sugar and a drop or two of vanilla mix that up done so you know these are going to be crispy again if you open up the oven and you can see the crust bubbling just a little bit that's absorbed butter refrying the surface i think i had those in there like seven minutes which is plenty to get the custard cooked through in the wetter batch here's the batch that's still dry in the center that's lauren's preference a little cream on top some berries would be very nice and fine canadians i caved and i got some real maple syrup you can really pour it on too because this is going to be crispy pretty much no matter what you do to it listen i remember this is the one we just quick dipped in the custard and so the inside just tastes like toast because that's all it is really light really crunchy nice if you're into that these are my pieces which are much heavier because they really soaked up some custard they're still basically dry at the very center but much more of their girth is custard and the custard cooked through because we baked this whatever you do definitely take time to dry the bread before you french toast it when the bread is still fresh and moist inside it just kind of collapses in the pan it comes out floppy and smashed flat this is still kind of airy inside which is why it is crispy crunch plus air equals crisp and bread plus butter and egg and cream equals sunday morning breakfast in my book
Chicken that actually fits on a sandwich | Garlic and mustard aioli,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OiO_Ame4YAI/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLBhxsvA6gaTp-sd26Vc5FmB_fu_fg,OiO_Ame4YAI,"11 minutes, 36 seconds",Thanks to HelloFresh for sponsoring this video! Use code ADAMRAGUSEA16 for up to 16 FREE MEALS + three surprise gifts across six HelloFresh boxes plus free shipping: https://bit.ly/3H8Rbgh...,29:02.6, this is something lauren used to have me make for her all the time it's a not fried chicken breast sandwich but unlike most chicken sandwiches the breast here is properly sized and shaped for a sandwich and i top it with this garlic aioli that i used to make with raw egg yolk but now i know that garlic itself is an emulsifier so you don't have to use egg if you don't want to one of many reasons i am generally not a fan of chicken breast is the modern product is just so huge it's far too thick for a sandwich so i'm going to get two sandwiches out of this one large breast and i could cut it in half there but if i tilt the angle thusly i can get rounder more sandwich shaped pieces after i butterfly them and note that my knife is like two thirds of the way up from the skinny tail end the half on the left there is thinner so if i want the two pieces to have roughly equal mass i've got to cut up here now to butterfly them generally when you're butterflying things you want to start by cutting into the thicker side which is that the cut side i'm slicing parallel to the board about halfway up from the board open it like a book and that seam is going to add thickness to what was the thinner end of that piece it's now quite even thickness all around same deal with this one cut into the thicker side which is the cut side stop before you go all the way through open her up you could trim that little bit down there to make it more sandwich shaped but these are going to be great as is hey note the grain of the meat the meat fibers all running parallel to each other the fibers on the surface tend to dry out during cooking and then they feel stringy as you bite through them this can be reduced by scoring the meat very shallow slices against the grain it's perpendicular to the meat fibers we're shortening those meat fibers they change direction up here and so must i same deal on the other side very very shallow slashes if you don't have a very sharp knife just skip this step you'll probably end up doing more harm than good here on the uncut side of the meat the grain is harder to see but look close you can see all those parallel fibers just a little scoring now and we won't get any long strings of dry meat between our teeth later the extra surface area we've created will also enhance absorption of our brine i'm usually not a fan of wet brines they give poultry the texture of lunch meat but that actually works for a sandwich and the added moisture from the brine is particularly good for thin pieces of white meat which are very apt to dry out into a cup 240 mils of water i'll put about 15 grams of salt which is a tablespoon of this morton kosher this is for a quick 30 to 60 minute brine if you wanted to let this brine overnight or something i would use half as much salt i'm putting in an equal quantity of sugar sugar is one of the flavor enhancing molecules that can actually fit through meat membranes during a brine no need to boil this or anything just give it a stir if the salt doesn't all dissolve now it will as the meat sits in here get all those submerged in the brine i'll set that aside and if i'm going to reuse this cutting board and knife i've gotta wash it because everything else we cut we're gonna be eating raw aioli it's gonna start with fresh garlic i'd say at least one big clove per sandwich i'll get them peeled and finely chopped to start with and then i'll grab my coarse salt sprinkle that over the top and use the salt as an abrasive to help me grind the garlic down with the side of my knife we need to kind of juice the garlic pieces we need access to all of the emulsifying proteins and fructans and saponins that are inside the garlic tissue grab a small dish that's good for stirring and in goes that garlic you could do this whole sauce in a mortar and pestle instead i'm also going to put in a roughly equal quantity of dijon mustard highly optional but i like how it tastes and mustard is also an emulsifier which means i don't have to use quite as much raw garlic which is of course very strong now for just a few drops and i mean a few drops of oil i'm using extra virgin olive oil but if that's too strong for you use a more refined oil get that stirred in until it disappears and then go in with another little splash you can add more and more oil with each go you just can't overwhelm an emulsion with too much oil straight away there won't be enough other stuff in the bowl to get in between the oil and divide it into tiny droplets that can then be coated with emulsifiers there's a reason people use egg yolk for this yolk is a much more powerful emulsifier garlic in my experience can only emulsify about three times its own weight in oil but we've got the mustard in there helping out too i think i got about three tablespoons of oil in there now and check how thick and glossy that spread is hey what would happen if you stirred in too much oil well eventually the aioli would start getting thinner and look kind of greasy like that there just aren't any emulsifying molecules left for all this new oil i'm pouring in and so i have tiny bits of emulsion swimming around in a sea of grease if this happens to you no problem just peel and chop another garlic clove grind it down with salt dump it in there and it may take some very aggressive stirring before the emulsion reforms but it should happen eventually again you're basically chopping up all of the free oil in there into droplets to be coated by emulsifiers from the garlic and there you go a totally solid gelatinous spread for our sandwiches it does taste extremely strong right now if you or anyone you'll be kissing later can't handle that much raw garlic just let this sit overnight that pungent allicin in raw garlic will break down significantly by tomorrow for tonight maybe just make a hellofresh the sponsor of this video and america's number one meal kit we got a fit and wholesome box this time let's go with that one i love soup hello fresh's newest menu

surprise gifts link and code are in the description for up to 16 free meals thank you hellofresh okay toppings i don't usually like tomatoes on burgers i just think they are redundant with the ketchup but on this chicken sandwich i definitely want a big slice of tomato our aioli is delicious but it's not sweet or terribly acidic and most food needs both of those things a little nice fresh lettuce and i have little interest in nearly any sandwich that doesn't have some pickles on it i'll grab some foil and wrap my culinary brick aka a brick i found outside wrap it in foil to keep everything clean you don't need this but some kind of heavy flat weight really helps time to fish the chicken out of the brine you could just lay it straight into the pan but it'll brown better and spit way less if you blot it dry on some paper towel first you certainly don't want additional salt on the surface but i do want plenty of pepper get a pan wide enough to receive the brick later get it heating to medium medium-low i just want to get it hot enough that butter will do not that that is way too hot there nice foamy butter you could use olive oil but butter tells you how hot your pan is and it really spruces up the super lean chicken breast get plenty of fat in the pan regardless because this meat is liable to stick pepper side down mop up all that butter i'll grind pepper on the reverse side real quick and then time for the culinary brick you could use another heavy pan anything that's flat heat safe and heavy will work or don't use any weight but the weight enhances browning and it helps you get a flat piece of meat that lies perfectly on a bun an ovoid chicken breast is very awkward to eat inside a sandwich the meat's been in there for two minutes let's check it not brown enough yet might need to turn the heat up with a piece of meat this thin you can just look at the side of it and see how far it's cooked through after three minutes total these are looking more than halfway cooked inside i'll go ahead and flip they shouldn't stick much if you brown them right but don't go crazy with browning chicken breast a little brown on these goes a long way now real quick i'll poke the center of the meat to see how it feels when i know it's still raw in the center i can feel it's still a little squishy a cheap thermometer is next to useless for taking the temperature of something so thin you're going to get false readings from the hotter meats that's closer to the surface so i'm just going to use my senses it's been a minute since i flipped i'll poke again and i can feel the center feels much more firm it's bouncy not squishy by the time these rest they'll be done but i will flip them one more time remember the brick touched raw meat and then it touched the cooked meat so out of an abundance of caution i'm going to give the first side a real quick second sear to kill any surface bacteria out to rest again with a piece of meat this thin you're going to get a lot of heat traveling from the outside into the inside if anything you want to pull these when they're a hair undercooked at the center while my pan is still hot i can toast the cut sides of my buns these are brioche buns brioche is a rich sweet bread i usually think it's overkill with burgers but with something as lean as chicken breast i think brioche is a nice compliment i'mma let this bread and the chicken cool for like five minutes if our aioli gets too hot when we put it on there the emulsion will break and it won't be thick and creamy anymore lettuce as a water barrier and then tomato check how nicely that piece of chicken fits on the bun if it's not enough meat for you make it a double stack on two pieces they still cook much better if you cut them thin a nice layer of that aioli on there very strong raw garlic flavor but again if you don't like that just let it sit for a day at room temperature or a few days in the fridge a nice layer of my beloved dill pickle chips the aioli holds them in place lid on and i think that looks awfully nice don't you it's been a few years but lauren used to have me make these for her all the time of course back then i used raw egg in the sauce and i'm not missing the egg at all in there now okay let's do the significantly less healthy version bun aioli tomato slice american cheese because it melts so well chicken let's do another layer of cheese and chicken the cheese between the chicken pieces will keep them from sliding around on top of each other i got my pickles and no lettuce i do not like cooked lettuce more foamy butter in the pan lay that baby in there and we already have a weight prepared boom a nice pressed chicken and cheese melt about a minute and a half later whoops she's sticking a little there we go flip her over mop some butter so it doesn't stick again replace the weight and american cheese melts so well that i shouldn't need to cover this but if you're using another kind of cheese you could press it for another minute rip the foil off the brick and use the foil to tent the sandwich for a sec trap some steam get that cheese melted again i'll give this a final extra flip because that brick had touched raw chicken out we go and this is not the most beautiful sandwich i've ever made but feels real good as i cut through it looks good inside tastes real good especially with those pickles i hope lauren doesn't ask me to make this version for her very often too much of that would wreck me

your basic big thick juicy burger nice and flat not all bunched up in the middle i've been boning up on burgers lately and i'm going to show you what i've learned we'll do some outside on the grill and some others inside in a pan i think thick burgers require totally different technique from thin burgers and different ingredients for a thick boy i want freshly ground loosely packed beef the stuff butchers generally grind in-house and comes out looking like worms this stuff works far better for a thick burger than ground beef that has been vacuum packed in a tight little brick this is chuck the classic burger cut you can get way more creative with your cuts but make sure whatever you're using is at least 20 fat a thick burger is going to be anywhere between five and eight ounces 140 to 230 grams raw weight i'm at the top end of that spectrum here and the key is don't try to mix seasoning into the interior of the meat do not knead the meat don't squish it really hard just gently pat it into a patty that's a little wider than how you want it in the end because it's going to shrink as it cooks i like to rotate it around and use my thumb to form a nice clean edge when you pack ground beef really tightly or knead it really aggressively you make the cooked texture really dense and rubbery and that effect is exacerbated if you work salt into the meat there's chemical things that happen protein bonds formed in response to the salt and also just the kneading and the smooshing keep the internal texture as loose as possible for a thick burger the only reason you can get away with kneading and salting meatballs and meatloaf is because there you're working in breadcrumbs and vegetables and other things that disrupt the protein matrix that's great but it's not a burger that's a burger and it'll cook even better if i depress the middle try to work the patty into like a lens shape or i guess it's an inverted lens i want the outer ring of meat to be thicker to slow its cooking the rim has more surface area so it gets more heat and is therefore liable to cook faster than the rest of the burger when that happens the rim of meat constricts and smooshes the center of the burger causing the center to bunch up in the middle then you have an elliptical burger that does not lie flat on the bun make that outer lip thick and you slow it's cooking since we can't season the interior we have to season the exterior really aggressively especially for thick boys like these you might not want that much salt but i do and i want lots of pepper remember there's a lot of meat here and then the burger seasoning that i swear by is garlic powder i'm a fan of this stuff generally but particularly on burgers the meat will keep the granules kind of wet enough that most of them shouldn't burn i've had my grill preheating and burning off the sludge from my last grilling for a thick burger i want moderate heat on my gas grill that means maximum heat gas grills are generally pretty weak compared to a charcoal grill for charcoal build a moderately hot fire if you don't know how to do that you just need to practice every grill is different for the grill i don't like to use any oil on the meat or on the grill grates it just drips down and causes flare-ups and on a thick burger i think oil can make the exterior go too dark brown before the inside is cooked don't push the patty into the grill grates at all that'll make it far more likely to stick when it's time to flip just gently plop it on and don't touch it i'll season the other side now i'm a fan of constant flipping when it comes to steak but with burgers you just can't you have to let the first side totally solidify as hard as possible before you flip if you don't the burger could fall apart all the good crust could stick to the bar is no good and i like to leave the lid open while the first side cooks that lets me cook the bottoms as firm as possible without overcooking the interior when you close the lid you trap ambient heat and turn the grill into an oven it cooks from all directions i just want to cook from the bottom at first a nice spirited sizzle there but nothing too crazy if the grill was too hot there'd be a bunch of smoke at this stage you'd smell burning if i was cooking this over charcoal i'd pile my coals unevenly so i could move the burger from hot zone to cool zone if necessary or vice versa i can feel that's not ready to flip yet it's gonna stick i've got some time to go inside and think about toppings it's vidalia onion season and my old friends at a m farms in georgia sent me a box hashtag not an ad just a fan vidalia's are extremely low in pungent sulfur compounds so they're great to eat raw on things like burgers and i've got some lettuce and some pickles that's enough all right these have been on the grill for seven minutes and really no matter what you do you'll need to scrape the burger a little bit to get it off the bars get every surface released before you flip or it's going to break apart especially because we didn't over pack the meat that loose internal texture is going to make the burger much more delicious to eat but right now it makes it more delicate to handle get every bit scraped clean off the bars before you flip at this point we're likely to have flare-ups because lots of fat is rendering out now and dripping down and catching fire a little flame char on meat goes a very long way i don't want this to taste burned nor do i want cancer which is a thing with burned meat so i will close the lid mostly to deprive those flames of some oxygen there's still flaming in there but probably not as bad i like to cook burgers most of the way on side one to get them firm enough to flip safely side two needs half as much time if you see a little juice pushing to the surface that means the inside is going to be about medium if you see a lot of juice flooding the surface like that that means the burger is going to be cooked all the way through by the time it rests which is how i want it i am not a fan of pink burgers and there's some health risk there too real quick i gotta melt my cheese reconstituted american cheese really was made for burgers because it melts so easily but i'm actually just using normal cheddar slices today they're gonna melt just fine if i close the lid and turn the grill into an oven to trap the ambient heat give it a minute and then have a look i'd like a little meltier tick tock tick tock tick tock ding that was seven minutes on side a four or five minutes on side b including the cheese melting time for a thick burger that's cooked all the way through and for a thick burger i like to let it rest on a plate for a couple of minutes it's gonna push out some juice at this stage and i'd rather that juice go out onto the plate instead of into the bun i hate soggy buns fancy burger joints these days often make their burgers too juicy for my taste they're a mess to eat speaking of buns i'll turn off my grill just to toast my buns a little in the residual heat if you want you can butter the cut sides and you'll get an even nicer effect than i do here i'll close the lid and let the buns steam through and get hot after a minute that's enough for me i don't want the bread to taste burned i mostly just want it to dry out so it can absorb some moisture without getting soggy people often like to put mayonnaise on the bottom bun to serve as a moisture barrier water doesn't mix with fat but i don't especially like mayonnaise so i prefer to use a single solid piece of lettuce as waterproofing for the bottom bun get my sweet vidalias on there straight from lions georgia and a burger to me is mostly just a dill pickle delivery device mustard and ketchup if you put your condiments under the meat they actually hit your tongue before your tongue hits the meat and it all comes together better in your mouth imho and there we go perfectly flat a little wider than the bun which is generally how i like it i don't like bread heavy bites and even though it's cooked well done that burger just crumbles in the mouth because we bought loose packed beef and we didn't overwork it or season the interior if you want a pink burger pull it when you just start to see juice surfacing and put the cheese on like right after you flip you won't have much time to melt it alright a good thing for doing burgers inside is a big cast iron pan but you can do a thick burger in any pan thick burgers are just generally easier to do at home in part because you don't have to crank the heat as high as you do for thin burgers i think that's a little too hot medium heat for thick boys and these i will grease up you don't have to worry about flame-ups inside and some oil will get you a nicer crust that'll compensate for the lack of smoky grill flavor and it'll guard against sticking which is a bigger hazard on a pan that makes full contact with the meat same seasonings as before salt pepper and my beloved garlic powder slap it in there and we should hear a spirited sizzle but nothing too crazy give the center a little push to make sure you don't have a steam balloon pushing the middle up and away from the pan plenty of fat is going to render out for cooking side b so i have no idea why i put more oil on there i just wasn't thinking it's totally unnecessary but more seasoning is definitely necessary after five minutes i can feel that a this is not ready to be flipped and b that spatula is going to be too soft to scrape that off the surface honestly i would do these in my non-stick if my non-stick was wide enough even in this huge cast iron i can only do two patties at a time thank goodness they're each thick enough to feed one person each there's a reason that thin patty burger joints especially favor a wide flat top grill you just need more horizontal space these look more than halfway cooked through it's been seven minutes it's now or never a little scraping with something rigid and cheese free ready to be flipped and look at all that gorgeous crusty browning boy yeah you can see i had plenty of fat in here to fry side b no point in adding more at this point the flipping has introduced so much water into the pan that i can tell the temperature is dipping i gotta boost my burner a little and it takes a little longer to melt cheese in a pan so i'm going to put my cheese on right away this is smoked gouda from the deli counter it really compensates for the lack of smoky grill flavor in the meat it just doesn't melt as readily as you'll see if you have a tight fitting lid go for it but i have to make do with a foil tent gotta trap some heat and some steam in there to melt the cheese as best as possible all right that's probably about as good as i can do without overcooking the burger people use american cheese for a reason it melts faster i just like the taste of this you can try to use a thermometer to gauge doneness but burgers are really easy to eyeball once you've done it a few times and you know what your desired doneness just looks like on the outside all right all that rendered fat and olive oil in there is going to make the cut sides of these buns fry up really beautifully golden brown this part works way better in a pan but honestly toasting the bun by any means available to you really improves any burger oh yeah that's gonna be good fried bread down lettuce onions i always try to make sure to push the toppings out to the edge it sucks when everything is bunched up in the middle the middle gets messy and the outside is bland i got my pickles ketchup and mustard and i think the meat has rested just long enough when i can just pick it up with my fingers it's just a minute or two of resting to purge the excess juice that would otherwise soggy my buns look at that nice crispy browning there you don't get that on the grill that's fried meat again a nice yielding texture even though we cook this all the way through i'll try to tackle thin patties at some point but for a home-cooked meal i think a thick patty is almost as user-friendly as squarespace everything you need to build and run a website

not it's spaghetti alasacina that's the feminine form of assassin it's from my ancestral homeland of bari in southeast italy and it's fascinating it's just spaghetti and red sauce but it's cooked in a manner totally different from like every other bowl of pasta you've had in your life it's more fried than it is boiled so it tastes really different the sauce is generally a little spicy so from my version of this dish i'm going to prepare a little garnish of charred pickled chilies a big pinch of sugar in a little bowl maybe a pinch of salt and then some vinegar any vinegar doesn't matter if that doesn't fully dissolve at first these are serrano chilis but i'd get anything small that's mild enough to where you can handle eating it whole and i'm gonna grab that with tongs and just blister it right in the flame from my gas burner rotate it around get it almost blackened all over it'll feel like it's not cooked inside yet but the inside will soften as it sits in this quick pickle solution it's still steaming hot if you don't have a gas stove you could do this with a kitchen torch or under the broiler in the oven but i probably wouldn't bother with that this is just a non-traditional garnish i'm doing for fun there i've got two quick pickles for two portions of pasta they'll taste like pickles by the time we're done cooking everything else i've also got two jalapenos here i'm gonna slice really thick for the sauce normally people just put dried red chili flakes in the sauce but i want there to be some noticeable vegetables on the plate if you don't want it super hot you could just pop the white pith out of some or all of these rounds the heat is almost entirely in the white stuff i'll peel and chop a big pile of garlic no need to chop it very fine because these pieces are going to be cooked and broken down very thoroughly as we cook our pasta for that same reason i think it's good to start with whole fresh tomatoes rather than a pre-cooked tomato sauce and in my part of the world i think these are usually the best fresh tomatoes for sauce that you're going to find in a mainstream grocery store grape or cherry tomatoes pretty good in any season one of these 10 ounce 283 gram containers for two portions and i will puree them as smooth as possible if you don't have some kind of food processor yeah i suppose you could chop them up really fine with a knife but i wouldn't bother i'd probably just use canned tomato puree in that case you can strain this to get out the skins and the seeds but i don't think there's any point fiber is good for you and the pieces are so small you probably won't even notice whatever kind of tomato product you're starting with the traditional thing is to dilute it down to like a tomato broth so i'll put in at least an equivalent volume of water it doesn't have to be precise and then i'll grab a big pinch of salt i want it to taste like it's as salty as a good soup would taste i know this recipe is already super weird the traditional pan for this would be a big well-seasoned cast iron pan i've tested this and i think this dish is a hundred times easier to do in a teflon pan and the results are better certainly this dish would be impossible to make in a stainless steel pan a generous film of olive oil in there remember the pasta is going to fry so we need some oil in goes the garlic and peppers to get a little head start although that probably isn't necessary i will put in a squeeze of tomato paste to provide that concentrated highly reduced tomato flavor that i'm not going to get from my fresh tomatoes i'll get my spaghetti half a pound half a package for two big portions that's like 225 grams and this dish comes out better if you get the cheaper pasta with a smooth shiny surface the fancy bronze cut pasta with the rough surface just sheds too much starch in this dish and the sauce comes out kind of pasty okay real quick i'm gonna pour in a thin layer of my tomato broth into the pan and look it's a 10 inch pan and the spaghetti is not going to fit so i have to break it call the pasta police you just lay the totally dry pasta in there nudge it around to get all the strands nestled down into the sauce this will also have the effect of displacing the peppers and the garlic up and out toward the rim which is good they're less likely to burn there now we'll just wait until enough water has evaporated that the spaghetti on the bottom starts to brown like that once that bottom layer is golden i'll put in another little dose of broth it's just like the traditional way of making risotto just work that liquid in maybe try to break apart any clumps of noodles that form but they'll probably break apart themselves as we go and actually the clumps are kind of nice at the end and while that dose of tomato water absorbs and evaporates you can just hang out for a minute which is plenty of time to save some money with the sponsor of this video fetch

it's happening it smells different it sounds different you hear fizzing and popping instead of bubbling that's the sound of stuff frying in oil you want to let that layer of spaghetti get good and brown before you repeat the process all over again another splash of tomato broth another good stirring to get all the pasta wet and flipped around so that a different layer can brown on the bottom you can see how thoroughly the sauce is going to get cooked via this process that's why i think it's best to start with raw fresh tomatoes we'll still have at least a little bright freshness left by the time we've cooked everything here to smithereens but honestly you could just use a jar or a can of tomato sauce and water it down maybe two parts water to one part sauce alrighty stuff is starting to fry again as you can see on the bottom a lot of recipes for this by italian folks tend to tell you to burn the bottom layer of spaghetti i suspect that's kind of a translation issue i don't think you literally want to burn things black but deep brown is good this is my fourth and final dose of tomato broth that should probably be enough to get the pasta cooked al dente stir stir stir it's interesting pasta like this that is cooked entirely in the sauce instead of in plain boiling water it tastes really different you taste the flavor of the sauce all the way through the noodle which i don't think is necessarily better i like contrast but this is good too i'm tasting that strand for seasoning could use another little pinch of salt before i evaporate out all the water and there's nothing left to dissolve the salt this is my last chance to really fry the noodles so i'm going to let that pan get really dry wait for the bottom to really brown get in there and oh there's the thumbnail if we were just using a stainless steel pan all of that brown stuff would stick to the bottom of the pan with my cast iron some of the brown stuff stuck to the bottom of the pan but with the teflon pan it all stays right on the noodle which is where i want it tradition be damned if you're out of tomato broth but the noodles still need to cook a little more or if you just want more liquid for a saucier texture you could totally just splash in some water or a little white wine if you're you know me makes almost everything better lastly i'll tear in some basil leaves i really like how the cooling sensation of basil contrasts with the spicy sauce stir that in and i think i might want a little more wine just to loosen up the sauce it's going to tighten up in just the time it takes for me to transfer this to a plate you know i don't eat a ton of pasta anymore because i try to wash my carbs and i keep forgetting that tongs are a far easier way to transfer any long noodle shape to a plate much better now i can garnish with my quick pickled charred chili not traditional and not necessary but very nice it fits with the almost smoky taste you get on that browned pasta and with the intensely sweet and sour tomato sauce that sauce gets cooked down to almost a jam it's very sweet especially because we used grape tomatoes which are extra sweet and the texture of the pasta itself is just so different it's got this toothiness it's crusty and because a lot of its starch kind of rubbed out into the sauce during cooking the sauce is velvety just like risotto risotto has a velvety mouth feel for the exact same reason this pasta is sweet and soft but with this dark spicy undercurrent of danger al-assasina the feminine form of assassin she cooks you this pasta and then she grats you they'll probably want to garat me back in bari when they see how i altered their traditional dish but i stand by my decisions

Use my code RAGUSEA to get $5 off your delicious, healthy Magic Spoon cereal by clicking this link: https://magicspoon.thld.co/ragusea_0422...",29:02.6, it's bread it's just a basic loaf of crusty bread flour water yeast and salt it resembles a french boule but i'm not calling it that because i don't want to arouse the gatekeepers i think i've worked out a particularly easy procedure for baking these at home you don't need a pizza stone having a dutch oven helps but i'll show you an alternative if you don't and there will be almost no measuring we're going to cook with our senses all you need is time mostly unattended it's a leisurely weekend project the night before baking we're going to make a poolish get a mixing bowl into that i'll put about a cup of water 240 mils the only reason i need to roughly measure the water is so i know how much salt to put in later but not tonight a pre-ferment like this poolish is generally made with a tiny amount of yeast i'm not even measuring it it's just a pinch maybe two pinches i like yeasty breads but too much yeast in a tall bread like this creates a risk that it might overproof and deflate plus a lot of yeast inhibits crust formation i want a really crispy brown crust now flour any kind of bread flour will do all-purpose would be okay it just won't rise quite as well in the oven and if i have some around i do like to mix in just a little whole wheat flour into plain breads maybe 10 percent of the total flour it makes the bread look prettier and give a little dimension to the taste and no i'm not weighing out my flour or measuring it in any other way i'm just stirring in enough to get a pudding-like consistency a little whole wheat flour in there the whole wheat flour probably has more micronutrients to feed the yeast though i have no idea if that would make a difference here that looks like pudding or maybe a very thick pancake batter no salt yet salt could maybe interfere with the fermentation and gluten development that's it that's poolish i won't even bother taking that wooden spoon out and cleaning it yet we're going to need it tomorrow i'll just cover that with a damp towel to keep it from drying out and let it ferment overnight at room temperature nice and slow because it doesn't have that much yeast in it that slow fermentation brings some really nice kind of caramel notes to the finished bread probably from starch degradation here we are the next day about 12 hours later i think anywhere from 8 to 24 hours would be fine you might get different results within that window but they'll all be good i've seen people use poolish for anywhere between twenty and sixty percent of their total dough mass i guess i'm going to use it for maybe forty percent here another cup of water 240 ml or so in the bowl with that again i'm just roughly tracking the water quantities that i know how much salt to put in for a relatively high hydration bread like this i generally like about a teaspoon of my normal morton kosher salt per cup of water remember i've got two cups total in here so that's two teaspoons maybe 10 grams of salt total if you're using a finer salt the equivalent volume measurement might be a little smaller because it's denser but then again i have no idea how salty you like your bread so i see no point in giving you a highly precise measurement be conservative especially if you're going to be putting some salty things on your bread later time for more bread flour and no i'm not measuring it my new favorite thing is to let the spoon measure for me i will simply stir in as much flour as i can stir in with a stout wooden spoon and i don't mean every last particle i could possibly jam in there i just mean as much flour as i can easily stir in that gets you a really good hydration for an easy to work not too sticky but still basically no need dough as a matter of personal preference i find it much more enjoyable to cook with my senses instead of having my head down in a written recipe and a scale and all that i also think the amount of flour you need is going to depend on exactly the kind of flour you're using and i don't know exactly what kind of flour you're going to be using for example higher protein flours absorb more water and protein content is not something your gram scale is going to tell you about so i say at least try just letting your senses guide you get in as much flour as you can get in with the spoon which won't be nearly as much as you could knead in with your hands i'm not going to touch this at all yet with my hands and i still won't take out the spoon we're not done with it i'll cover this up let it ferment let the flour hydrate and knead itself through the magic of autolysis for an hour or so now if i'm gonna eat all those carbs later and still hit my macronutrient goals for the day i'm gonna need a high protein breakfast from the sponsor of this video magic spoon cereal it's all the cereal flavors you love from childhood but on totally grain free high protein low carb little crunchios oh hello that's the new honey nut flavor i've been waiting for this to my delight this flavor has some real honey in it so yeah it's got one measly gram of total sugars per serving but it's still only four net carbs and a whopping 13 grams of protein these other flavors have zero total sugars all magic spoon flavors get most of their sweetness from a clever blend of locale sweeteners like allulose which is my favorite and the primary substance of this stuff is milk protein rather than wheat or corn

whatever flavors you want they ship in the u.s canada and the uk now too go to magicspoon.com regucia and use code ragusia to save five dollars try the honey nut thank you magic spoon alrighty now that the flour has hydrated for about an hour the surface of the dough is shiny that means it can take a little more flour now and if i give it a little more it'll be easier to work less sticky but if you're a real cowboy go for the super sticky dough that's what the pros generally do again as much flour as i can easily get the dough to take with just the spoon speaking of which thank you for your service spoon i'm finally done with you i'll cover that dough and let it ferment again for about an hour or so until it's noticeably puffier it doesn't need to fully double in size yet just be kind of puffy now i'm going to sprinkle on some flour purely to keep the dough from sticking to my hands i'm going to do the stretch and fold maneuver that is typical of french boule technique get it released from the bowl a dusting of flower all around grab one side and pull it out until just before it starts to tear then fold it back in rotate like 90 degrees and repeat pretend it is a square stretch out each side of the square as far as it can go without tearing it and fold it back unless you're working with a super wet and sticky pro level dough the last side is going to be kind of tough to stretch don't force it just do what you can now i'm just going to reposition this so that all the seams are on the bottom and the smooth surfaces on the top and then cover and let rest again for maybe 20 minutes come back when you get a second repeat the folding procedure all over again what we're doing here among other things is building up a nice taut skin on the surface of this dough a skin that will retain gas in the oven and help the loaf puff up nice and tall i think people generally do this down on the board but the bowl is big enough and it keeps the mess contained you could probably do this folding procedure just one time but lots of classic recipes tell you to do it like three times that probably results in better flavor more fermentation time and a stronger gluten network from the extra kneading that this effectively is we'll do our final stretch in about another 20 minutes time to think about baking vessels a big heavy oven-safe pot with a tight-fitting lid is probably the best commonly available option for home bakers but again if you don't have a dutch oven i'll give you an alternative later you won't have to clean the pot at all if you line it with parchment paper this also helps you lift the finished bread out at the end just smash it up into a ball open it back up again and it will lie perfectly in the pot best tip anyone's ever given me time for the third and final stretch of this dough again pull each of the four sides of the imaginary square out and fold it back in again then i'm going to pick it up gather the seams together on the bottom and lay it smooth side up right in the pot people usually preheat the pot in the oven and then transfer the proofed dough straight into the hot pot i think that's a tricky and messy maneuver that can be easily avoided i'm gonna let this dough proof right in here for about a half hour covered with the towel the lid i will preheat inside the oven might as well people bake crusty breads like this at temperatures between 450 and 500 fahrenheit my oven has given me better results at 500 so that's what i'm doing that's 260 celsius but lots of people go a little lower a half hour later the oven is rocket hot and my dough is nice and puffy time to score it the pros use razor blades i think a good serrated bread knife does okay at home as long as you are swift about it a quick confident slice through the surface now watch this next one i'm going to lose my confidence on it see i didn't move fast enough and the knife kind of snagged the goal is to create some slits on the surface that will allow the loaf to expand more in the oven from internal steam pressure but you want to do so while pushing as little of the yeast gas out of the dough as possible that's why you want it to be a quick elegant shrimp again i went too slow and the knife snagged oh well good enough now rather than try to transfer this delicate dough into a rocket hot pot without bashing it up and degassing it i'm just gonna leave the dough right where it is and give the pot a head start on the stove my beefiest burner on max i'll bring the hot lid over from the oven to trap the heat check how much darker it is when it's hot don't touch that i will touch the sides of the pot because when the pot feels really hot i've given it all the head start it needs a super hot pot helps the bread to puff up while it's still malleable though if i had a really slow heating electric burner i'd probably just skip this step i think the hot heavy lid does a lot by itself in the oven the pot will trap steam as the loaf bakes this mimics the effect of a professional steam injection oven steam will keep the surface of the dough from getting too hard too fast which would restrict the growth of the loaf i want it to be as puffy as possible so i'm going to leave it alone to steam for about a half hour i find that's a pretty safe minimum half an hour later i will very carefully remove the lid and you'll see how the loaf has steamed up the steam also does some chemical magic to the starch on the surface that enhances browning in the later stages of baking it's the same reason you boil bagels and pretzels before then baking them i'm going to give this another 10 or 15 minutes of dry heat uncovered to brown the surface i do find it helps to drop the temperature a little bit at this stage i'm going to 450 fahrenheit 230c if i don't do that i tend to get some surface burning by the time the inside is done i think thermometers are great for testing the inside of large breads and large things generally you get a much more reliable reading than you'd get in a small thing especially with a cheap thermometer anything in the neighborhood of 200 fahrenheit 93 c is fine some people prefer it a little lower some people prefer it a little higher it should be a little too wet on the inside right now and a little too dry and hard on the outside because as you let this cool the moisture level will equilibrate across the whole mass water on the inside will push outside and the crust will soften it'll still be real crispy it's cooled for about an hour and check out the blistering on that shiny surface you do not get that without some amount of steam in the bake and check out the brown craggy peaks around where we scored people call those ears cut with a serrated knife and hear the crispiness now behold the inside that is not the lightest crumb ever achieved on a bull type loaf but it's not bad i'll smear some softened butter on that and give it a whirl it's funny i usually bake extremely high yeast flatbreads that could probably never bake this tall or as brown i'm used to tasting the fermentation but this tastes more like wheat a very clean wholesome taste a classic for a reason and of course the best reason to bake bread yourself is to have it really fresh which is a rare and special treat now say you don't have a dutch oven let's do the same thing on a sheet pan my dough is ready for its final half hour proof to keep it from drying out i will dome it with the heat safe metal bowl under which i plan to bake it half an hour later the oven is preheated to 500 fahrenheit 260c the dough is puffy i'll score the skin honestly that's a lot easier to do when it's not down in a pot bowl back on and do not let it touch the sides if it touches the bread will bake into the bowl and bond with it and then when you go to take the bowl off you'll end up destroying the loaf in the process which is exactly what happened to me here follow me on instagram for more amusing fails based on my tests there's no real point in preheating this rig it's all light cheap aluminum which has very little thermal mass it doesn't retain heat the way a big iron dutch oven does but the dome will retain steam here in the oven i'll check back in in a half hour very very carefully removing that hot bowl that did stick a little to the bread but not as bad as the last time and you can see the steam allowed the bread to puff up real nice but that thinner metal did not radiate as much heat onto the surface so it needs some help browning in the last 10 or 20 minutes i'm not gonna lower the oven temperature this time instead i'm just gonna turn on my convection fan it's okay if you don't have one just crank your oven to max power in that case just for the last 15 minutes or so to brown that crust that looks pretty nice i'll take its temperature circa 200 fahrenheit 93c is good that was just over 45 minutes total in the oven let it cool and as soon as i start sawing into this one i can feel the crust is not quite as thick and crispy as the one we did in the dutch oven and the interior feels a little more dense we didn't get as much oven spring as we did in the dutch oven with its incredible thermal mass not as much internal steam in the early stages of baking to puff things up but this is still way better than any crusty loaf i've ever attempted in a home oven without some kind of dome or other steaming agent steam is everything thanks a lot to fellow youtube cook brian lagerstrom who gave me some great baking tips on the latest episode of the new adam ragusia podcast which is available wherever you download pod if you believe my bool to be bad you'd better blame brian it took me like four takes to get that last line

***RECIPE***...",29:02.6, it's just a cake it's a yellow cake with chocolate frosting that's all it is that's what i wanted so i made one there's no clever hacks no secret ingredients well there's a kind of secret ingredient in the frosting i usually don't like homemade buttercream and there's a couple of things you can put in it that i think make it a lot better we'll get there first cake these are 8 inch cake pans 20 centimeter diameter for some reason 9 inch cake pans are more popular in my part of the world but they make a cake that is too wide to fit on a typical dinner plate plus the easiest way to make a cake look more professional is to make it taller and narrower so get tall eight inch pans grease them up and then i think it's worth grabbing some parchment paper these are already folded over twice get it folded twice and then if you're right-handed you get the folds on top and the left make a triangular fold down and then another in the same direction then snip the triangle to the length of the pan's radius unfold and there you've got a custom parchment round that guarantees you'll be able to get your cake out without destroying it folds are on top and on the left mirror image that if you're left-handed triangle fold downward twice trim to the length of the radius done set those aside yellow cake is a butter cake i have a stick and a half which is three and a quarter cups 170 grams of butter it's salted but that doesn't matter just account for it when you add your salt later either remember to leave the butter out to soften or speed soften it in the microwave on my microwave it requires that i do the absolute lowest power setting nuke them for five seconds at a time stop and rotate the sticks generally the part touching the bottom gets more heat so that's why you got to rotate when the butter is just barely pinchable like that it's perfect don't melt it with a relatively high sugar cake like this one i think it's especially beneficial to whip the butter by itself a little before you put the sugar in get it as fluffy as you can by itself if it's cold and hard this obviously won't work you could replace maybe a third of this butter with oil and get a softer texture that's a little bit more like a boxed cake i like that but lauren prefers the all butter one so that's what we're doing now i can put in a cup and a half of granulated sugar 300 grams it's a lot of sugar relative to the butter so you'll see i'm not able to cream this very fluffy that's why i think it's good to whip the butter first but cream the butter and the sugar as best you can until it's a little lighter in color indicating the presence of air bubbles which will make the cake fluffy later on i got four eggs the first two i will beat in one at a time you could beat them in all at once but it would just take longer with a bunch of loose eggs sloshing around in there the second two eggs i'm going to separate and i'll only put in the yolks extra yolk will make the cake more yellow and the emulsifiers in the yolk will help it hold more water and fat inside itself make the cake more moist these whites i'll eat for breakfast later buttermilk the greatest single gift to cake bakers it makes all cakes more moist and flavorful where i live it's a fermented milk product if you can't get it the best substitute is to take sour cream or creme fraiche or something and mix in water or milk until you get this kind of thick milk texture a cup and a half 350 mls you'll probably get an even fluffier texture if you warm that and the eggs to room temperature before mixing but it's not necessary oh and vanilla that was probably too much it's gonna taste real good but it'll make the color of the cake a little beige cake flour my favorite brand hashtag not an ad about 300 grams two and a half cups though i might hold back a little bit before i can assess the final texture you can always add flour at the end half a teaspoon of baking soda to neutralize the buttermilk acid not for the sake of taste but for the sake of structure too much acid makes it hard for cakes to set and brown two or three teaspoons of baking powder for leavening and two or three grams of salt which is half a teaspoon of this morton kosher i would double that if i was using unsalted butter now just whip this smooth wiping down the sides of the bowl as needed by the way if you don't have cake flour you can get a decent substitute by replacing about an eighth of your all-purpose flour with starch cornstarch potato starch rice flour any starch that doesn't have gluten a batter for a basic cake like this generally comes out best when it's the consistency of like jello pudding that looks a hair too loose to me so i'm mixing in a little more flour looks perfect now and i'll just eyeball half and half into each of these pans we already prepared if you want to check your work without a scale just jab the handle into the center of one and check it against the other i overfilled this one a little so i'll transfer some over there in the oven we'll go at 350 fahrenheit 180c convection if you have it now i know what you're thinking you're thinking isn't adam on a

tap the pan give it a little bump if the center of the cake jiggles like that you need more time five minutes later the jiggling has ceased time to pierce the cake with an object and see if it comes out clean that skewer came out with a few crumbs on it almost done but i'll give them a couple more minutes in my oven with these relatively tall and narrow pans they took half an hour but it always depends let those cool and solidify meanwhile frosting two sticks are a cup of butter 230 grams softened as before and whipped as before yes that's an obscene amount of butter i hate to break it to you if you didn't already know this but frosting is basically just fat and sugar once the butter is fluffy i'll beat in about 300 grams of powdered sugar or like two and a half cups you might think that's not enough sugar for buttercream but i've got more coming it's much easier to beat this super fine sugar into butter if the butter is already whipped up first it'll look terrible at first like cheese curds or something but just keep going and all of a sudden it'll look like frosting you could beat in another cup or two of powdered sugar and this would be a great basic buttercream but i want chocolate 50 to 100 grams of cocoa powder half a cup to a cup depending on how chocolatey you want it i like dutch cocoa but natural would be just fine that's a cool shot gotta save that for my reel when i have to get a normal job again someday now there are two ingredients that massively improve the texture of homemade buttercream in my opinion the first is corn syrup or any kind of syrup i want like half a cup 240 mils and you can measure that by just looking at the bottle here so the rest of this bottle goes in syrup just gives the frosting a dense gooey quality that i really like in highly industrial cake frostings and that i miss in a homemade buttercream and here's the secret ingredient meringue powder where i live it's hard to find in a grocery store but it's easy to find in craft stores big box hobby stores or fabric stores they usually have a cake decorating section with all kinds of pro level stuff i don't know how meringue powder is made industrially but traditionally it's just baked meringues egg white sugar starch pulverized into a very fine powder it's a safer alternative to raw egg whites and the pros use it to make buttercream more plastic to help it hold its shape instead of just dripping off which it has a tendency to do a big scoop of that like a heap tablespoon it's not necessary but i really like what it does to the buttercream texture mix this up and you may need to loosen this with a little water or i'm going to use the buttermilk i already have get the frosting just wet enough that you're going to be able to spread it without tearing the cake a little water or milk will also make the frosting shiny taste it and adjust i'd put in a little salt if i wasn't already using salted butter you can add more of anything more cocoa but don't judge the chocolatiness by color the frosting will darken considerably as it dries on the cake so go by taste i want a little splash of vanilla in there and we are done cover this if you're not going to use it immediately the meringue powder will cause a little skin to form on the surface which is nice once the frosting is actually on the cake i'll grab a cooling rack and de-pan these literally just turn them and let them drop into my hand and then i can peel off the paper the paper is so worth it you might need to run a knife around the edge of the cake to help it release but these dropped out just fine now you must cool the cakes completely before you frost them i might even put this rack in the refrigerator just to speed the process if your cakes are still warmer than room temperature they will melt the buttercream follow me on instagram for such things eragusia on instagram once cooled i can grab a serrated bread knife and top these cakes just shave off their humps what you choose to do with these trimmings is between you me and the lamppost some people use guides to make sure their cuts are perfectly flat i'm happy just freehanding it frosting helps obscure all manner of imperfections dust off the crumbs grab a plate and see an eight-inch cake fits right in there dump on almost half of your frosting and then a big knife or an icing spatula like this makes the job way easier just gradually work the frosting across and over the sides no need to actually spread the excess onto the sides yet we'll do that in a sec just get it off the top of the cake to make room for the second layer and then the rest goes on top you'll probably need every last bit of this frosting it should seem like you have too much at this point the more you have on there the easier you can spread it around without tearing the cake you can also scrape away any excess but i've tried to give you a recipe here that minimizes waste let it fall over the edges and then you can go around and frost the sides on the top you can lay your spatula almost parallel to the surface and then swish back and forth that's an easy way to get some attractive waves i like to go around the sides one more time after i finish the top and here we are now i'll just take a wet towel and wipe around the edge of the plate to get it clean vaguely professional that is and there's always room for sprinkles on top or as my new york italian-american father would call them chocolate jimmies you can chill the cake in the fridge and the frosting will then have a chewier fudgier consistency thanks to the corn syrup that i really prefer but you do you and you do cake whenever you want it doesn't have to be somebody's birthday every day is somebody's birthday yeah isn't it okay okay yes grandma can eat it whoa daddy looks like pac-man again
Lamb shanks with roasted garlic sauce | celeriac purée | broccolini,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TPWIdj4I3yA/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLA6v1_z0DpdhpR_GRnbfzg9wBOguw,TPWIdj4I3yA,"10 minutes, 31 seconds","Thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this video!

fancy cuts of meat out there lamb shanks might be the easiest to cook pretty much anything you do to them will work as long as you go low and slow people often braise them my preference is to slow roast them takes about four hours so this is a weekend dinner for sure but most of that time is unattended i made these with a celery root puree and this roasted garlic lamb sauce that is possibly the best sauce i've ever made lamb shanks if you can't get them or you don't like that lamby flavor you could totally do this with beef shanks beef shanks are generally cut into bone-in steaks but because lambs are smaller these are basically full shin bones and you don't have to do any home butchery to them at all the bone will clean itself in the oven i know what you're thinking didn't he just post a video where he says he never cuts himself in the kitchen well i don't this was a woodworking accident or let's call it a poor choice i'll just grease these shanks up with some olive oil and season them generously there's a lot of meat here i'm doing salt pepper and mustard powder i like mustard with lamb now for the garlic sauce we need garlic you could just throw a bunch of whole peeled cloves into that roasting tray but i'm going to do the thing where you cut the top off of a whole head make sure that every clove has an escape hatch at the top that's not very fresh you can tell by the green cores i think i'll do two heads roasted garlic is not pungent in the way that garlic normally is so you can use a lot of it i'll throw those in there and get everything coated with oil and seasoning out of an abundance of caution i'll position the garlic heads underneath the shank so that they don't burn under the broiler if your oven doesn't have a grill you could just blast them at maximum baking temperature for a few minutes or just skip this step we're going to brown them again at the end but i think browning them a little bit up front results in better flavor across the whole dish i'll flip those and give them another couple of minutes under the broiler shanks have such an irregular shape it's much easier to brown them in the oven rather than frying them off in a pan alrighty that was just five minutes of browning broiler off i'll get everything even in the roasting tray and if i were gonna braise these i would put in some liquid maybe halfway up the meat but i'm gonna be slow roasting so no extra liquid i'll just seal this up pretty tight with foil to trap some steam and keep them from drying out throw that in the oven and i'm doing 285 fahrenheit 140c anything in that general neighborhood will work celery root or celeriac it's also called if you like the flavor of celery this makes a shockingly delicious mashed potato-like puree it is much more work than mashed potatoes so maybe just make mashed potatoes but if you want to try this step one is peel the skins are very tough and thick so it takes a while honestly one big celery root would have been enough for this meal but i've got two once peeled i'm gonna slice these pretty thin celeriac is very hard to cook it reasonably quickly you gotta break it down into the smallest pieces you can manage i might just try grating it on a box grater check how hard that bigger one is keep your fingers well out of the way now i'll stack up a few slices at a time and match stick these this gets us plenty of surface area and that'll help these cook quicker and really just to make them easier to stir around i'll cross cut them a little bit to get a very rough dice good enough it's getting pureed in the end a pan big enough for the job and i'll melt in a fair bit of butter there are probably easier ways of cooking celeriac but i'm basically doing this famous recipe by chef raymond blanc the first thing he does is cook the pieces in some butter for a while with this huge quantity i'm going to have to use high heat and stir constantly this phase gets some really nice flavor on the pieces and gives them a good head start on cooking after about 10 minutes they've reduced in volume by maybe a third and things are starting to turn brown which i don't want so what raymond blanc does is simmer them in milk you could use water but milk tastes really nice you want just enough to get the pieces covered pieces that are really exposed will oxidize and turn brown then you just turn the heat down to low cover and gently simmer until soft which can take a real long time okay this is going to look kind of gross but have faith the milk has curdled and that's just fine it's great even those curds are going to give us amazing flavor the celeriac chunks are soft i simmered those about an hour which is honestly more than they needed but i was busy elsewhere riemann blanc tells you to lift the chunks out of the liquid with a slotted spoon i'm just pouring the liquid out instead that is almost entirely whey that has separated from the milk save it for now then dump the solids into the food processor this is not a potato it's basically impossible to mash smooth by hand sorry i steamed your face there blast that for a while until it's as smooth as you can get it depending on how it's looking you might need to mix in a little of your reserved liquid to thin it out time to flavor it with salt and the magic ingredient which is a little cayenne or any dried chili powder works amazing with this and blanc calls for a squeeze of lemon if you've got it it tastes good and it'll help keep the puree from oxidizing and turning brown it might not be the prettiest stuff in the world but it is so sweet and nutty and rich tasting despite having very little butter compared to how i would normally make mashed potatoes alrighty my lamb shanks have been slow roasting for about four hours and see the bone cleans itself just by touching the meat i can see it's fall apart tender my garlic is golden and totally soft we're done and you can totally eat these just like that they'd be great but i'm going to remove them to a baking sheet at this stage you could refrigerate them and finish them later i'm just going to hold them for a few minutes while i make my sauce and then roast them again for a few minutes totally dry to crisp the surface sauce take the garlic out to let it cool and depending on how many shanks you did and how big your roasting tray is you may or may not have a lot of juice in here along with all that rendered fat if you can see two distinct layers of liquid like that that means you have a lot of water-based meat juice in there along with the fat and i like to turn the heat on and boil most of that water out just takes a few minutes in a tray this wide eventually you'll hear the pan go from a boiling sound to more of a fizzing frying sound that means most of the water is gone you can see meat solids floating around in the grease and browning and that's enough with the water out i can very easily pour off the rendered fat while keeping the tasty stuff that was dissolved in the juice right there in the pan where i want it roast some potatoes in that lamb fat another day now that my garlic has cooled a bit i can squeeze it out of the skins compared to normal garlic roasted garlic is like a totally new substance it's this sweet silky goo you can spread on toast or use as a sauce base heat back on and normally i would use white wine to deglaze this pan but i have this incredibly flavorful celery whey here might as well use that i'm just holding back any leftover curds that have settled on the bottom of the jug if you need more liquid just use water you could just use water period there's plenty of flavor in here already scrape the pan to get all the solids dissolved and mash up the garlic to a smooth paste you could totally finish this sauce as is but if you need it to be really smooth and pretty for your thumbnail yeah you could strain it through a sieve this is really pointless and i feel bad for doing it don't bother straining it this is purely cosmetic i can return this to the pan but it's in a heat safe bowl so i might as well finish it in here i just want to melt in quite a bit of butter with just enough heat to melt it nice and slowly monte auber they say there should be little or no bubbling too much heat and you break the natural emulsion of the butter with the emulsion intact we have thickened our sauce we've enriched it and we've increased our overall sauce volume i'll give that a taste doesn't need any more salt but it needs acid and i happen to have another half of that lemon from before so in it goes between the lamb fond and the milky celeriac broth and the roasted garlic and everything that is probably the most extraordinary sauce i've ever made myself i'll throw the shanks back in the oven to reheat and brown a little i might turn the oven up to like 400 fahrenheit 200c real quick i'll steam some broccolini which is not to be confused with the visually similar broccoli rob broccoli rob is very bitter this is very sweet after a couple of minutes it's just barely fork tender pulled the steamer basket out i love that steamer basket dump the water melt in a little butter broccoli back in pinch of salt toss there's our veg and here's our shanks i just think there's so much more appetizing if you dry out the surface for a few minutes and get them a little crispy the celery root puree i literally just reheated in the microwave totally fine this shank really is not as much food as it looks like most of the mass here is bone and some other inedible stuff it's a perfectly reasonable single portion you might even want to make one or two extra shanks in case you got some small ones time for that sauce i think you want to get that sauce tasting a little too acidic on its own because you need that acid to cut the richness of this meat lamb shanks have a lot of fat in them which is why you can slow roast them without drying them out when you braise them in extra liquid i think they can come out too moist like a wet mop these are perfect inside still pink because we use such a gentle oven temperature yeah i think you should probably just make mashed potatoes but give raymond blanc celeriac puree a try sometime it is a whole nother thing delicious and like i said you could do this recipe with beef shanks they might take a little longer in the oven but they'd be way cheaper why is sheep so expensive at least here in the u.s and why are certain people turned off by its distinct and powerful flavor we'll talk about that another day what we can

delicious cinnamon rolls really buttery and tender but also fluffy and they hold a real tidy shape in the oven i'll show you the standard sugar glaze but i'm also going to show you an unconventional frosting inspired by marshmallow fluff i love this frosting my wife hates it we report you decide to make a yeast dough that is extremely buttery but also has a strong enough gluten network to rise we need to follow a kind of weird procedure i've got a mixing bowl and that's a third of a cup of milk 80 mils and i'll throw a little pinch of sugar in there for the yeast even though they probably don't need it they do need me to heat this up a little bit which you could do in the microwave but my stove has the advantage of being right here i'm just looking for body temperature or something a little north of that i'm only making half a dozen rolls today and yet i'm putting in a whole packet of dry yeast which is a lot seven grams more than two teaspoons you could use half that but i like the flavor i get from extra yeast and i will let them rehydrate and wake up while i grab butter 2 tablespoons of butter 30 grams i'll melt that in the microwave real quick and then in goes a quarter cup of granulated sugar 50 grams that sugar will lower the temperature of the butter thus making it safe for my egg if you were gonna bake a full dozen you could just use the whole egg but i'm making half that so i'm just gonna use the yolk in my dough pure yolk makes the rolls taste a little better anyway and i have plans for that white in goes three or four grams of salt which is like half a teaspoon of this morton kosher i think cinnamon rolls are far better with a noticeable amount of salt in them and lastly a little glug of vanilla which you can skip the frosting will have vanilla in it too get all that stirred up and smooth my yeast is all frothy so it's time for flour you could use all-purpose flour but i think bread flour is better and lately i'm loving this double zero pizza flour that recently arrived at my grocery store hashtag not an ad just a fan double zero is a super fine grind of flour and it makes these rolls noticeably smoother but any flour is fine the extra protein of the bread flour will help these rise in spite of all that butter and also give them a heavier and silkier mouth feel literally just as much flour as i can stir in there if you want precise measurements watch somebody else i think it depends on what kind of flour you're using anyway so i say just go by feel as much flour as you can easily stir in to this much liquid which for me ended up being just under a cup that i will simply leave to autolyze and pre-ferment for about a half hour over here with my fatty liquids i might as well stir in some flour too again just as much as i can stir in which ended up being maybe two-thirds of a cup there's so much fat in here that the gluten in this flour basically won't be able to develop at all but at least i can get the particles hydrating a bit which will cut down on kneading time plus all the greasy liquid here will be much easier to integrate with the other dough when it's in paste form like this okay i'll just cover everything in a damp towel and come back half an hour later clearly a lot of fermentation and gluten development has happened if we'd mixed everything together at once the huge amount of butter and sugar in this recipe would not have allowed that kind of rise i'll dust more flour on there and dump in my greasy paste use my flowery hand to scrape off the spoon and get to kneading need until this is homogenous dusting flour as necessary to keep it workable kind of groovy at this stage yes lots of popular cinnamon roll recipes have you mix everything together at once but you will note they probably have proportionately less butter than mine here i've tried doing the direct mix on a dough this rich and it just doesn't rise you do it this way you get the best of all worlds i want enough flour in here so that the dough is still a little sticky but i can form it into a reasonably smooth ball perfect maybe two cups total of this double zero bread flour in here maybe 250 grams cover and let it rise again until doubled an hour or two during which time we can clean up and maybe listen to a podcast hey this guy has a new podcast available everywhere and we can crank it on the new mini speaker from cove the sponsor of this video i was filming a recipe where i cooked a steak and a pan big sound from an adorable little package this connects to your phone or whatever via bluetooth 5.0 or a simple cable if you want great battery life great big sound and get this you can buy another one and chain them together with the push of a button now you've got true stereo sound that you can

speakers with my link and code in the description and you will save 67 or more link in the description use code a mini 67 for 67 off the cove mini commuter thank you cove so after two hours this has about doubled don't be concerned if you don't get a huge rise at this stage again there's a lot of fat and sugar in there pull her out to a board and a little dusting of flour so nothing sticks and then roll this out to a rectangle that's about a foot wide 30 centimeters the closer you can get it to a perfect rectangle the less waste you're gonna have at the ends the bottom long edge i want to roll way thinner than the rest this will be the flap that i used to seal the roll let me get some more melted butter ready another couple tablespoons we'll use this for a couple of things now and this bowl is already dirty so filling a third of a cup of brown sugar 65 grams or white sugar with a little glug of molasses because that's all brown sugar is and i actually want more molasses than brown sugar normally has so heavy hand with the molasses the eponymous cinnamon i like a whole tablespoon for six rolls which is a lot but i like it spicy this is pre-ground and pre-ground is generally less powerful so you need more with it a teeny little pinch of salt is good and then this is important just enough melted butter to make this the consistency of like damp sand i'll stir this up real good and then see if i need more if you put too much butter in the filling it'll all melt out during the baking and just run all over the pan but i need a little more in there just to make the filling hold together if there's no butter at all the filling is powdery and it just falls out of the roll before you can even bake the thing there that consistency is a good compromise take some melted butter and grease up the inside of the dough sheet avoiding that thin flap at the bottom we want that to be the opposite of slippery dump on the filling and pat it as evenly as possible don't bother getting it all the way to the edges on the sides because we're just going to trim off that excess anyway and keep it off that flap at the bottom that's our seal and accordingly i'm going to get it wet plain water this will glue the whole roll together and keep it from bursting open in the oven time to roll starting with the long thick end don't stress about rolling this super tight it's even better if you don't give the layers some room to puff up in the oven get the seal on the bottom so gravity presses it down a little bit and at this stage you could just put the whole roll in the fridge slice it and bake it for breakfast in the morning i've got some leftover melted butter so i might as well rub it suggestively around the whole cylinder this will make the edges bake up even tastier and there we go time to slice trim off that end first and then you can get really clean even slices i'm going maybe an inch and a half thick four centimeters aiming for six rolls and there we go grab a baking sheet lined with parchment if you've got it and then very gently lay on the slices cut side up this would actually be a lot easier if i had chilled the roll overnight so if you do that you definitely want to cover these and let them warm up and proof at least a half hour before baking which i'm going to do anyway they're a little puffier after a half hour proof which is good and then they go at 400 degrees fahrenheit 200c convection if you've got it while we wait here's that weird frosting i was telling you about my reserved egg white goes into a saucepan along with another third of a cup of sugar 65 grams heat on medium and then whisk continuously if you aren't whisking when this reaches the critical temperature you're going to suddenly have scrambled eggs oh i forgot we need a glug of corn syrup or honey or some syrup that is not all sucrose like the table sugar is if you don't use the syrup the sugar recrystallizes and gets super grainy just keep whisking and you'll see the egg protein start to coagulate and thicken and two minutes later i've got a mayonnaise-like consistency so i'm done i'll turn off the burner and in the residual heat i'll melt about a tablespoon of butter just melt it in real gently so it doesn't break time for a splash of vanilla whisk that in and there you go marshmallow glaze it's italian meringue but a little thinner and richer which makes it better for a thin coating it has a strong marshmallowy flavor which i believe is basically the taste of sugar plus protein the rolls have been baking for just about 10 minutes and they're almost done even though they look kind of pale if you over bake these the filling just melts and leaks out and you can see that's starting to happen over there also if you over bake them the centers start to push up like little spires and eventually that causes the whole roll to fall apart plus i think you want the texture to be soft and a little doughy so when the edges are just a little golden that's it out they come and let them cool until they're firm enough to pick up maybe 10 minutes meanwhile i'll mix up the more conventional glaze if you want to see that which is just a pile of powdered sugar a little glug of milk and an even smaller glug of vanilla stir stir stir and really it takes a tiny amount of milk to get this all dissolved into a smooth thick glaze and you could glaze the rolls on their parchment paper but hey this is already dirty so let's do this professional like on a rack this is my marshmallow glaze over here and my preferred way of doing this is to just dunk in the top get it completely coated in glaze and as it drizzles down the sides on the rack it'll spread in attractive ways alternatively you could just put one on the rack and drizzle with a spoon side to side or you could do the little spiral pattern or if you're four and a half years old you could just try total chaos i can just mustard it mustard it sure that's the conventional glaze by the way made with the powdered sugar and milk which looks about the same as the marshmallow on at this stage but it tastes pretty different and it dries to a more crispy texture with a matte finish i like the marshmallow one better myself now honestly i know these don't look particularly remarkable but the texture and flavor of these is way better than any homemade cinnamon roll i've ever had before including all the ones i've made before that pre-ferment step just makes all the difference in the world try it if you don't believe me

My previous ravioli video that shows...",29:02.6, i've finally figured out a vegetable ravioli filling that i like something really bright and fresh that does not use meat or cheese as a binder i got it by imitating tibetan style dumplings that i've had vegetable momo they're called momo are traditionally made with a simple water and flour dough which you could totally do here but because i'm doing italian style ravioli i'm doing an egg pasta dough two eggs in a bowl for a dozen big ravioli and if i have an extra yolk candy i use that but today i don't so i'm using a small glug of olive oil it's not the same but has a similar effect of enriching the dough now it's just a matter of mixing in as much flour as i can which will probably end up being about a cup and a half maybe 200 grams at most i just mix in as much as i can with an implement because this is the really sticky messy part and when i can't do anything more with that i'll start hand kneading just giving the dough as much flour as it will take it's easier to do this on a flat surface but if you want to keep the mess contained for now you can do it in the bowl pasta dough really doesn't have to be thoroughly needed at this stage this kneading is more about just getting the flour particles in there so they can hydrate that's probably good enough i could get a little more flour in there but for ravioli especially i don't mind if my dough is still a little sticky to the touch that'll make it easier to work later the real trick is to cover and let the dough rest for 20 or 30 minutes before you roll it out during which time filling a shallot a small zucchini a carrot and a few garlic cloves i'll cut the root ends off of those and then rather than smashing them i will roll the cloves between my hands this loosens the skin so you can just peel it off while keeping the cloves whole and intact i also want the shallot hole so i'm just doing a shallow cut to peel off the outer skin i want these things whole because i'm going to grate them grated veg is the perfect texture and shape for a dumpling filling and the zucchini is really the key ingredient that sticky mucilaginous slime in there is the binder for the filling and i'm sure any other kind of summer squash would work instead now the carrot grating gets you pieces that are fine enough to hold together in a coherent filling but not so fine is to end up like a mushy goo any other kind of onion would work just fine for this i like shallots because they're small i'll switch to the small holes for the garlic i don't think the grater is the best tool for garlic i'm just using it because it's here there that's the filling now we just got to cook it down in a little olive oil you don't have to use a pan this wide i'm just using it because i'm going to need a wide pan later for the particular presentation i'm doing on these ravioli i'm going to pan fry them i'll just stir those veggies as i cook them gently for five minutes max i'm not trying to brown anything i just want to soften and concentrate these done heat off i'll give them a pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper stir taste for seasoning and we're done the flour in my dough has hydrated the gluten proteins have autolyzed and at this point rolling the dough will be all the kneading that it requires today i'm doing one big sheet of dough on my counter with a rolling pin and some flour for dusting if you don't have a big easily cleaned working surface like this in your kitchen i've got another gnome machine method you can do with just a little cutting board where you use a pint glass to roll out one little bit of dough at a time that video is linked in the description the rolling pin is more efficient for making a large quantity of ravioli even though i'm only making like two portions today for demonstration purposes roll and turn roll and turn turning ensures that your dough won't get hopelessly stuck to your work surface with a rolling pin i think it's basically impossible to roll pasta dough too thin so just get it as thin as you can and that's it that looks ready to contain my filling almost as capably as my boxer briefs from the sponsor of this video sheath these brilliant skivvies were invented by a u.s army veteran who grew weary of uniquely male friction-related discomfort whilst marching around iraq see there's distinct compartments for

thank you sheath okay so i'm just going to use an upside down pint glass to punch out rounds for circular ravioli press hard and then twist to cut the rim of the pint glass is the opposite of sharp which means it might take a little extra pushing and twisting to get these out but the upside is it's not scratching my counter at all the cutting board really wouldn't be big enough for this once you've got out as many rounds as you can you can gather up the trimmings and ideally you'd want to let that rest a little while before rolling it out again let the added flower hydrate and let the gluten relax i don't have time for that so i'll just do the best i can no way i'm gonna get this as thin as the first rolling but whatever punch punch one two three four five six twenty three ah i need one more it has to be an even number each of these is either a base or a lid 24 circles means 12 ravioli now i can deposit little balls of filling gotta remember to only put this on half the circles and i really am balling it up before i put it down i don't want little strands of vegetables sticking out into the edges where they might break the seal speaking of which i'll definitely need a little dish of water handy to wet the edge before i seal on the lids when you roll out all of your shapes in advance like this yeah that's super efficient but it also gives time for the surface of the pasta to dry out and these would be impossible to seal together without a little extra water as glue just peel the ravioli up off the counter immediately after you've sealed it or it'll be glued to the ground once sealed ravioli are very freezable i would not boil them first i would just lay them on trays in a single layer so they don't freeze together throw them in the freezer overnight bag them up once they're hard you can make 100 ravioli on a weekend and then monday night just throw them frozen into the boiling water they'll thaw and cook in minutes these are good to boil now though you could go back with the pint glass one more time to clean up the edges each ravioli should be a little wider now than our original mold because we stretched it out as we sealed the edges together this final punch out probably has the added benefit of reinforcing that seal though i've got a hole in one of them and there's really no way to fix that now this is why i usually prefer to roll out one bit of pasta at a time the dough stays wetter and more flexible that way it doesn't go dry and brittle like this sorry i steamed your face there extra salt whenever i make fresh egg pasta i always think the water needs twice as much salt as i would put in for dry pasta and then i'll drop in the ravioli a few at a time so they don't stick to each other even the one with a hole in it it won't be pretty but it'll cook up just fine these should take like three minutes before they've all visibly puffed up lightened in color a little bit and started floating eagerly to the top like little buoys it's hard to mess up boiling fresh egg pasta anywhere between two and four minutes seems to yield nearly identical results to me i'mma drain these pretty thoroughly normally i would hold back some pasta water in the pot for sauce but today i need these dry because i'm gonna pan fry their surfaces you don't have to do this you could just toss these in some tomato sauce or something but i like to melt some butter in a wide pan oil would be fine moderate heat and as you lay the boiled ravioli and you got to move them either swish them around or shake the pan or both if you don't keep them moving they'll stick hopelessly to the pan i love this method but you can only fry one portion at a time five or six big ravioli in a pan fortunately this only takes a minute so you could fry multiple portions in rapid succession get them as brown as you want before flipping them a little bit of browning goes a very long way if you take it further than that they start to taste a little doughnut-y at the last minute i might throw in some fresh parsley or sage leaves to fry a little bit that's parsley you could eat these just like this maybe with some cheese on top but if you want a saucy or texture you could turn the heat off and deglaze with just a little white wine in this case or stock or reserved pasta water just a splash of liquid to deglaze the pan and that would also be good as is but you could wait for the bubbling to pretty much stop and then melt in a little more butter unlike the browned butter this butter has intact casein proteins that'll form an emulsion with everything else that's in the pan get you a nice velvety sauce if you use unsalted butter you might need to stir in some salt now give the sauce a taste before you spill this out onto a plate gorgeous if you fry the surface of ravioli it makes them a little tougher to cut through but that chew is delicious in the mouth and check how well that filling is holding together with only the zucchini as a binder the texture of that filling is just so smooth and fresh i love it and thanks to little tibet in bloomington indiana for giving me the idea with your delicious vegetable momo i've eaten a million times

the greens in the meaty pan while the steak rests and garnish with pickled mustard seeds my new favorite thing they have the texture of caviar and you can make them the day of but they get better as they age in the fridge for a few days i just bought a bottle of mustard seeds in the spice isle at my mainstream grocery store but you can buy whole mustard seeds for much less money here in the states if you go to an asian grocery first thing i'm gonna do is just cover them in plain water and bring them to a boil while i wait i have a shallot and red chili i will dice both of these to pickle with the seeds they'll taste nice and provide some color seeds have come to a boil you can see they've already plumped up a fair a bit i will drain them and then even give them a little rinse blanching the mustard seeds helps purge some of the bitter compounds inside them the same things that make mustard greens and other cruciferous vegetables bitter some people even repeat the blanching process a few times i'm not going to bother a little bitterness doesn't bother me and there's reason to believe those compounds are good for you antioxidant now i will more than cover them in vinegar i'm using rice vinegar because my whole dish today is using east asian flavors and rice vinegar is usually my all-purpose vinegar anyway some people use a mixture of vinegar and water i like my pickles tart with that i will put in a handful of sugar you could skip that or use less these actually came out a little too sweet for me i'll give them a couple of pinches of salt and then bring to a boil i can resume dicing my vegetables i'll get that shallot all cut up i just want the pieces to be roughly the same size as the mustard seeds once cooked now this second boiling in vinegar i like to do for 10 minutes at most i find that gets them plump while still preserving their caviar-like crunch i'm sure the time will depend on the kind of mustard seeds you're using and you can simply taste them to assess their doneness if i need to add more vinegar or water to keep them submerged i will but in general i'm trying to minimize the liquid to concentrate the mucilage coming out of the seeds i want a thick creamy condiment for my steak for the last two minutes or so of cooking i'll throw in my vegetables i don't like for them to boil too long and get all mushy but a little boiling will help extract some flavor and color from them very quickly heat off and we're done here i'll give it a taste it's a hair too sweet which i can't really fix it needs salt that i can fix you could use this right now hot i'm going to throw it into a container let it cool and then chill in the fridge if you're just making refrigerator pickles you don't have to be fussy with your sanitation your chemistry you just make them taste good to you they'll last in the fridge for at least a couple of weeks and basically get better and better time to actually make dinner i'm gonna peel and mince some garlic and ginger for my greens you could skip this or just do one or the other the greens will get a ton of flavor simply from the beef but garlic and ginger make pretty much anything better greens i was going to use a bag of pre-washed pre-trimmed mustard greens to go with my mustard theme but i saw this purple curly kale at the store and i just had to have it i love purple and curly greens are so good at grabbing sauce and bringing it to your mouth i'm just trimming the stems out of each of these leaves you don't have to get the whole thing out just the really thick part sometimes i throw the stems in the compost but today i want to eat them fiber is good for me since i'm doing a very quick cook on these greens i'm going to slice the stems very thinly this will allow them to cook super fast in the hot pan and i'll need to set them aside in a separate bowl because they're going to go in before the leaves which i will hack through somewhat indiscriminately this may seem like an astounding amount of greens but for a meal like this you really need like two whole bunches for three or four people because they cook down enormously most of the volume here is just air you may have noticed a pattern with today's ingredients dark greens and garlic and ginger and mustard and lean fresh red meat these are all foods that studies have associated with modest increases in testosterone

leave home visit trylgc.com adam ragusia use my code adam30 you'll get 30 off your test with my link and code in the description thank you let's get checked so the cut of steak i'm using today is known in american butchery as sirloin it's kind of the transition between the expensive tender cuts of the animal's back and the tough cheap cuts of its hindquarters british and australasian butchers generally refer to cuts from this area as rump steak the biggest muscle in it is the gluteus medius there's actually a little bit of tenderloin there and then there are a few other muscles that start to run down into the hip you'll find sirloins butchered all kinds of ways what i like to do is cut out the individual muscles cut along that intermuscular or seam fat and then trim it off get rid of it along with any connective tissue in there if you're not sure where the seams are between the muscles just pull the seams will tear naturally up to a point if i separate all the muscles out i can remove all of the gristle and blubbery bits of fat that a lot of people would eat around anyway on their plate and this means i'll be able to cook each muscle a little differently some will need more time than others post trimming that's maybe around a pound and a quarter of meat just over half a kilo enough for three or four people i'd say what we americans call sirloin here is relatively inexpensive it is a true steak meaning it's cut against the grain of the muscle fibers and in my opinion sirloin has the best flavor of any true steak that is a very lean and b still pretty tender big beef flavor with fewer calories i'll get my widest pan heating over high flame if you have a very powerful electric stove you'd probably want medium or medium high i'll get my ventilation pumping there's gonna be some smoke enough salt and pepper for both sides of the steaks i'll rub it all around in just a second today i'm also doing a tiny little bit of chinese five spice it's very strong so just a little bit drizzle with a little oil and then i'll rub everything everywhere i actually wish i'd put on a little more oil than i did this meat is so lean it needs a little extra fat on the surface to get a nice golden crust i'll put the biggest pieces in first because they'll need more time i'm pressing to make sure i get good contact with the pan and whenever possible i very much favor the constant flipping method of cooking steak flip every 30 seconds or so i'll poke to get a baseline reading of what these particular steaks feel like when they are raw on the inside i think near constant flipping does cook the meat a little more evenly but more importantly it gives you situational awareness if the pan is too hot you're gonna see the meat just starting to burn before it's too late to turn the heat down which i did do here that little bit with a piece of filet on it is already done so out it comes another reason i like using a wide relatively thin cut for this particular recipe is the pan is mostly covered in meat and that will minimize the uncovered area on which the fond is likely to burn at stake searing temperatures i want to cook my greens in here in a minute and if there's a ton of burned fond that's going to make my veggies taste bad plus burned meat is potentially carcinogenic alrighty when the center of the steak feels like it's just firming up relative to that baseline poke i did at the beginning that means i'm getting into medium rare territory which is what i want it's also a good sign if i see pink juice starting to surface as i get down to the last big pieces i will turn my heat way down or else everything is going to burn a decent crust on those that would have been nicer if i'd used more oil okay my kale stems go in first they need a couple minute head start to get soft and again because that meat was so lean i think i need some more oil in there for quicker cooking i use extra virgin olive oil for nearly everything by the way my heat is on about medium stir stir stir and when i can see those pieces starting to soften i'll stir in my garlic and ginger and immediately after i'll start putting in my leaves if you gotta push on them for a second you can get them cooking a little faster no worries if you can't fit them all in yet depending on how wet the leaves were you might need to splash in some water to help deglaze the pan and keep the aromatics from burning also just to serve as a thermal interface to get the leaves cooking down these leaves had just enough water on and in them already now that they've shrunk a bit i can fit in the rest and i'm gonna hit these with a little thai fish sauce but you could use soy sauce or worcestershire or again even just water it's been four minutes since the leaves went in and they looked just about done to me i'll taste for seasoning they don't need any more salt because the fish sauce was salty i am going to summon forth the upside down bear even a little honey really knocks back the bitterness of dark greens and makes them glossy we are done off the heat now the meat is perfectly rested and ready to carve i'm doing thin strips at an angle mainly just to make it pretty and easy to eat this is not like flank steak where you have to slice it thin to make it chewable you can serve these steaks whole i just love cooking meat and then cooking my veg in the same pan while the meat rests because thick cuts of meat need to rest but vegetables do not they are best hot and fresh right out of the pan so it's synergistic and the greens are so hot they'll actually reheat the slices of beef here's my mustard seed caviar straight out of the fridge i like the temperature contrast but you could heat it up or simply eat it right after you boiled it i obviously have way more mustard seeds than i'll need for this meal but that's fine i will eat them on nearly everything i cook for the next week or two they're awesome on eggs honestly those are better than caviar in my opinion and unlike caviar they are inexpensive good for you and totally sustainable i've got a few cilantro leaves on there by the way but they're hardly necessary i do not cook a lot of steak at home anymore for many reasons but i will definitely be doing this one again an excellent post-workout meal

...",29:02.6, berry souffle with a fresh berry sauce perhaps the fanciest dessert i've ever made and not that hard as with any souffle the downside is you cannot make it in advance but you can take it up to a certain point in advance eat dinner chill for a while make the souffle and then have it with a night cap with my recipe here the berry sauce is both the garnish and the flavor and color for the souffle base so it's pretty efficient these are six ounce 170 gram boxes of berries two of them for just two portions raspberries and blueberries are a good combination and you could take a few of the prettiest ones out to reserve for garnish at the end a tablespoon of granulated sugar in there 12 grams and then i'mma get my potato masher and mash these up but you could use just about any means of destruction at your disposal fresh raspberries are super delicate so this probably isn't even necessary for them but the blueberries have stronger skins they need a little help popping open i will say you might want a little more sauce than this recipe makes i'm just trying to be efficient because fresh berries are expensive but you could totally throw an extra box of whatever berries you want in here and another big pinch of sugar it'd be fine so my heat is on medium and now i need to stir it pretty constantly to keep anything on the bottom from burning and help everything just break down i'm looking to see the plant tissues in there fall apart you'll see the sauce loosen up a bit at first as more juice gets released and the color will deepen lots of color cooking out of the blueberry skins i think i simmered that for about five minutes and it's okay if it seems like there's still good stuff locked in the solids because now we take a bowl and a sieve dump everything in and grind with a wooden spoon push and scrape in circles until you have just a ball of seeds and skin left make sure you scrape off the sauce clinging to the underside and now you should have about a cup of a sauce that tastes like artisanal pop-tarts give that saucepan a rinse just to get out any chunks get two eggs and a bowl big enough to whip them in crack them into said bowl and now i'll separate out the yolks these eggs are real fresh so this is going to be a two-hand job the yolks are clinging to the whites yolks go into the saucepan which should have cooled down by now with the yolks we'll have another two tablespoons of granulated sugar 24 grams grab a whisk and mix those up you'll definitely want a real whisk for this recipe not a fork or anything then my starch will be two tablespoons of corn starch 16 grams you can make souffle with a butter and flour roux but the cornstarch gets you a lighter more marshmallowy consistency that i want here there's not enough liquid in the pan to disperse all that starch so i'm gonna grab about two thirds of my sauce two thirds of a cup like 160 mils and gradually drizzle that in as i whisk it's just important to get all the starch granules dispersed in a thick slurry before you add in too much liquid if there's too much water all at once the starch will clump up that's pretty smooth and the last thing i'll put in there will be a tablespoon of butter 14 grams heat on low the classical way of cooking a souffle base is to cook your butter and flour roux bring the liquid up to a simmer and whisk that gradually into the eggs and the sugar preferably over a double boiler with this recipe i've found it's pretty safe to just put everything into a cold pan and heat it directly over low flame as long as you whisk non-stop and you don't take your eye off it if you stop whisking and or if you heat it up too fast you risk getting scrambled eggs if you get the butter melted in and you've been whisking for a couple of minutes and nothing is happening you might need to up the heat a little bit but be careful slow and steady wins this race after five minutes of whisking all of a sudden there's my egg proteins coagulating you can see it gotta keep whisking so they don't clump up in curds a minute after that there's my cornstarch gelatinizing that happens at a higher temperature and you have to wait for it luckily it's easy to see and now we're done get that off the heat let it cool everything thus far can be done well in advance when you're ready to bake it's time to beat the egg whites until they are as fluffy as my hybrid foam and spraying mattress from the sponsor of this video helix sleep i'm so confident in this mattress that i'm going to drop my very expensive camera straight onto it from ceiling height the

pillows they're the best pillows thank you helix sleep so with my egg yolks i'll put in a tiny pinch of cream of tartar but you could use a few drops of lemon juice or something that'll stabilize the foam as will a little pinch of salt and the dessert needs a little salt anyway beat that until you get the egg whites pretty stiff and when they start to look glossy and leave trails like that now for about 40 grams of sugar you could use granulated sugar but powdered sugar gets you a finer texture and a much smoother prettier top on the souffle that's a third of a cup of powdered sugar and i'm beating it into the egg whites in two batches because it's a lot of sugar and too much at once could collapse the foam now just beat this on full blast until you have pretty stiff peaks like those last thing just a little splash of vanilla too much will mess with the purple color a couple ramekins would be the standard baking vessels but i'm gonna use a couple of tea cups because they're prettier and they have handles melt just a little bit of butter and then lightly grease the insides classically trained chefs always talk about how you must use vertical strokes on a souffle mold and i'm always like well how else could you physically do it with a brush now we take a little bit of this meringue and just whisk that mercilessly into the cooled souffle base we're gonna collapse that bit of foam it doesn't matter we just need to lighten up the base a bit so that we can more easily fold it into the rest of the meringue the classical way of doing this really works cut and fold cut and fold nice and gently trying to get to a homogeneous mix in as few moves as possible we don't want to deflate the foam too much though honestly souffles are so light that you really can't afford to lose a fair bit of air here the thing is still going to rise glossy and gorgeous that is time to pack in the batter all the way to the brim and push it down to make sure you don't have any big air pockets that could throw off the cooking all the way to the top and then smooth it off these are standard teacups about 200 mils i tried doing a bigger portion in a tall coffee cup and i could never get the center cooked enough the dimensions just weren't right here's another classical trick that really works take your thumb and scoop a little lip out of the top right around the rim i've tested this it's worth it it keeps the souffles little muffin top from drooping over the sides as it expands how many of us know about that problem in our own lives last thing i'm gonna take a damp paper towel and clean these cups a bit because the baking dish is the serving dish my oven is at 375 fahrenheit 190c not convection obviously google your teacups to find out if they're oven safe but if they're normal stoneware they probably are that glaze fired in a 2000 degree kiln it's gonna be fine in that oven for like 20 minutes while you're waiting you can clean up and pour the remaining third of a cup of sauce into an attractive little serving spout if you have one that sauce is maybe a hair tart and under sweet on its own but on the souffle it'll be the perfect counterpoint i've been baking about 18 minutes and things are looking pretty gorgeous when the tops are just a little golden brown the inside is generally perfect those need another minute or two but i like to pull these when they're still pretty wobbly which you can assess by just tapping the cup a bit i think souffles should be a little gooey inside if it's solid it's just a sponge cake souffle start to deflate or fall the instant you take them out of the oven and the steam subsides so the trick is to eat them right when they're just cool enough to not burn you i'll let these sit until i can touch their handles you could spank on a little powdered sugar if you want maybe put a few of those reserved berries on top and then a pretty common way to apply sauce is to dig a little hole in the center see inflated but still gooey then pour your sauce into that little crater kind of like filling a jelly donut in addition to tasting absolutely delicious the sauce helps visually as gorgeous as souffles look on the outside they always look disgusting inside and the sauce kinda covers that up you can see how the edge pulls away from the cup because we buttered the inside i am really happy with this recipe that is sexy food a perfect date night situation and again not that hard though i would recommend trying it at least once before the big night if you've never done a souffle before that is just fruity velvet on a cloud

***RECIPE, FEEDS 4-6***

4-5 lb (circa 2 kg) chicken legs (smaller ones...",29:02.6, there's a way of cutting chicken legs that transforms them into a really delicious and fancy finger food the result is reminiscent of a french track of lamb but at a tiny fraction of the cost and it's way easier to do i've got just under five pounds of chicken drumsticks here two kilos i think this technique works better with smaller ones if you can get them i'd figure three or four small legs per person my cut chicken is gonna go in this roasting pan and my trimmings will go in a skillet step one grab the chicken by its calf muscle that's what it is and then maybe a third of the way up from the ankle cut all the way down to the shin bone and rotate the leg as you saw saw through all of the meats and the little tendons that are in there until you have circumnavigated the bone then use the knife to scrape the meat off the bone up toward the ankle if there's anything you failed to cut through it will reveal itself now push everything down as far as you can around the ankle joint then position the belly of your knife right under the joint there take your other hand and smack the spine of the knife clean through the bone nice you're gonna see some blood in the cut bone it's not cold blood because it doesn't have plasma but red and white blood cells and platelets are all made in bone marrow so there it is i'll show you that one more time grab the leg by the media end cut straight to the bone right where the meat starts to bulge out saw as you spin the bone there are ropey tendons in there that can be hard to cut through and i find the sawing motion helps get them but you still might miss one no problem see what we're scraping away here is the least appetizing part of the drumstick anyway it's the thin stringy part set the knife right above the ankle and this is like karate chopping through boards it only works if you do it with full confidence don't hold back if you shattered the bone at all try to get rid of any shards they're real sharp beautiful meat with a clean bone in the tray discarded ankle in the pan we'll make our sauce with those once you get the hang of this you can blast through the job pretty quick just take your time when it comes to hacking through the bone if the knife can cut straight through a chicken tibia it can cut through one of your fingers no problem hey fun fact chickens do have fibula bones the smaller bone that runs parallel to the tibias and our shins but in birds for some reason the fibula is teeny tiny almost like a splinter you might not even see it because it doesn't even go all the way down to the ankle except on penguins okay enough salt and pepper to season every surface really well and then i like a light dusting of cornstarch for this particular recipe just a little it helps get the skin extra crispy and then it helps the glaze to adhere later on get that all tossed and coated a little oil to grease everything be careful as you're tossing these around because the end of the bones are real pointy you could stick yourself into the oven at 400 fahrenheit 200c convection if you've got it we'll check on those again in about an hour meanwhile we can make a quick stock with all of this bone and skin toss in a little oil just to get them browning i'm on medium heat and i'll just let those get nice and golden over here i've got a couple bunches of green onions out of the upper middle portion i will cut some thin slices at a pretty angle i'm gonna garnish my plates with these at the end the middle there is the part that tastes pretty good raw throw those into a bowl and save for later the bottoms and the tops i'll just roughly slice up and use for my stock i'll also grab a few garlic cloves smash and peel it's all getting strained out so no need to chop pretty give those ankles a stir no worries if the good brown stuff sticks to the pan we'll dissolve it in a minute it'll seem like the veg isn't going to fit but give it a second to cook down and it will keep stirring get some brown on everything not too much i've definitely been too aggressive about this kind of browning in the past and you end up getting some burned notes in your sauce that's good enough i'll make some room and squeeze in a little tomato paste stir and brown that a bit and then you know it's time for half a bottle of white wine though you could certainly just use water i'll scrape the bottom of the pan real good this is not necessary but i've got some cheap dried mushrooms so i'll throw those in just for flavor and then top off with enough water to submerge a little salt and pepper to start with bring the whole thing to a boil reduce to a spirited simmer and uh yeah now i got a moment of me time i'm trying to get myself back in shape and the good thing about kitchens is they almost all have a place where you can do dips i hope this impresses jose my personal trainer from the sponsor of this video future i've been working out for 25 years but i could use a little extra motivation and accountability right now i went to future's website i told them what i like to do what equipment i have available what i like in a trainer i want logic and science and they matched me with jose they also sent me a welcome box with an apple watch inside which monitors my vitals so now jose knows exactly what i'm doing or not doing with my body good morning good morning he sends me workout plans i follow them straight off the app i take videos with my phone so you can correct my form since it's all remote this is way more affordable than traditional training and they'll design a plan for whatever gear you have available fitness noobs with nothing are welcome use my link in the description to try your first month of future for just 19 cheaper than most gyms try future dot co slash adam your first month is just 19 bucks thank you future and i'll need some carbs to power those workouts so into about a quart of salted boiling water i'll whisk a cup of cornmeal 150 grams i'm making polenta today though mashed potatoes would be great instead that's just under a liter of water in there which probably isn't enough but you can always add more later take the heat all the way down on that cover and just let it sit for at least a half an hour let's roast some carrots with the chicken i've got like two pounds of these beautiful tri-color carrots on the small side so the little ones all just roast whole long ones i will cut in half long and thick ones i'll cut in half and then bisect the thicker top end just under a kilo of carrots there god i love carrots the chicken legs i've roasted for an hour they're cooked you could eat them but i want them to be really soft and crispy dark meat you can quote unquote overcook and it basically braises itself it just gets softer and i think better now that everything is released i'll make some room on the other end of the tray and dump in the carrots it's totally fine if they're all piled on top of each other a little drizzle of oil on those and a pinch of salt toss toss and then i don't want the chicken piled up on itself i want each piece to brown so i've got the meat spread into a single layer back this goes to roast for another half hour my quick stock has been simmering for just under an hour i topped it off with extra water once or twice no need to get it reduced time to strain sieve in a bowl dump everything in really squeeze the stuff with a spoon to get all that delicious juice out discard the solids and give the pan a quick rinse just to get out any chunks that was a quick stock but still check out all the gelatin nice back in the pan bring to a simmer from here i am following the chinese american restaurant playbook soy sauce honey or any sugar vinegar and corn starch i'll dump a couple tablespoons of starch in here a tiny splash of water and then just use my finger to work out any lumps get all the starch granules dispersed if you don't start with a smooth slurry it's going to clump stir briskly as you drizzle that in that was too fast i'm going to have some lumps now drizzle slower than i did i certainly won't use all that slurry but it's nice to have extra so you can adjust bring it to a simmer it'll thicken right up cornstarch will get me the shiny glossy vibe that i'm after today i'll splash in some soy sauce you could use worcestershire or you could just use salt but i like the darker color a splash of any vinegar you like or you could use lemon juice summon forth the upside down bear or use corn syrup or just plain sugar a lot this is going to be a glaze not a sauce there will be proportionately very little of it on each bite so it should taste way too strong on its own i think it needs a little more salt so i'll give it some more soy sauce and at this stage it should look a little bit too thin it's going to thicken a ton by the time we actually eat it this is too thick i ended up having to water it down a little bit later my carrots are like two-thirds of the way cooked which is how i want them they got a half hour in the oven the legs got 90 minutes any more than that and they would get too soft they'd fall off the bone nice blonde color on those dark brown on chicken skin tastes burned imho and swirl them around in the pool a nice first coat of glaze on each of these if you glaze them one at a time you can be gentle and avoid knocking the meat off the bone plus you can keep that upper handle of bone nice and clean this is a finger food after all this first coat of glaze will kind of harden and then you can give them a second coat right before you eat resulting in a lacquered effect they're way too hot to eat right now they can just sit there on low and keep warm until we're ready the polenta is super soft and creamy i'll drop in a few tablespoons of butter to enrich it season the taste with salt and pepper you can use cheese if you wanted and whisk in more water if you want keeping in mind it's going to firm up a lot as it cools the carrots need a little more cooking and there's lots of great flavor in that tray so turn on the heat throw in a little water scrape as much brown stuff off the bottom as possible let the carrots soften to exactly the tenderness you desire as you reduce that liquid down to a glaze gorgeous vegetables tend to go cold before everything else does which is one reason i try to finish with them actually everything is sitting in warm pans right now which would make this a great buffet style meal for a small gathering people gonna swing by and serve themselves i'll get some of that polenta on my plate a few of those glazed carrots and the chicken i'll give one final glazing before i set it on my plate sprinkle on some green onions and that's basically wings but fancier and way meatier the meat pulls away from the bone real easy most of the yucky sinew is just gone and you can't go wrong with carrots roasted in chicken fat

* These statements have not...",29:02.6, i wanted to try to make a really nice chickpea curry something that tastes really meaty and creamy and substantial and rather than try and fail to recreate anybody's traditional dish i gave myself license to do whatever i want it turned out vegan incidentally and you could certainly do it with like four cans of chickpeas drained and rinsed but it's kind of amazing how much better the dried ones are if you've got the time one pound 454 grams of any kind of chickpea you like into a big bowl and i will soak them overnight in plenty of water they're going to double in size so just plain water on top there you could use salt at this stage it'll make them a hair firmer on the inside the baking soda trick is really only good for making hummus i think it gets them too soft here they are the next day looking all swole i will discard the soak liquid i find that chickpeas more so than other beans absolutely wreck my system unless i purge as many oligosaccharides and other indigestible things as possible rinse and drain just like washing rice get a big pot dump in the beans yes chickpeas are beans so are sweet peas and again i'll cover them with more than enough water to keep them covered while they swell i'm using filtered water i have pretty hard water lots of minerals and that can slow down cooking but it's not a big deal either way what would take agonizingly long would be cooking them in my sauce instead of in plain water my sauce is going to be acidic low ph makes beans cook very slowly bring this up to a boil you know giving dry beans at least some time at a full boil can probably help deactivate more of their lectins which can definitely mess you up now i'll reduce to a spirited simmer that just helps them cook a little more evenly than the full boil and salt salt at this stage can slow their cooking a bit and firm up their texture but there's a flavor benefit to be gained so some salt cover and those should be sufficiently pre-cooked in about an hour meanwhile i'll toast my spices in a dry pan i've got some green cardamom black cardamom fenugreek seeds cumin seeds black peppercorns i'm just improvising i have like a kit of south asian whole spices that i keep around to play with i don't cook this kind of food very often so it behooves me to use whole spices because they basically last forever but you could definitely use any pre-ground pre-mixed curry powder or masala that you like when i can smell them toasting i will take them off the heat and into my coffee grinder oh and i wanted some coriander seed too but i was out and they only had pre-ground at the store i used to worry that my spices would affect the taste of my coffee in here but it never happens even though i kind of wish it would sometimes i'll get some oil heating in that very wide pan while i peel and chop an onion i don't care if i do a pretty job on any of my veg cutting today because i'm going to pass this whole sauce through a sieve later onion in and i'll stir that every now and then as i chop up my peppers i'll fillet those sides of bell pepper off of the fibrous core very nice could that work for a jalapeno if you don't want the heat found in the ribs meh kinda again sloppily chop that up and in it goes with the onion which is already turning brown i'm on pretty high heat here intentionally peel and chop a little garlic stir that in and while it goes i'll prep like a pound of tomatillos you could use all tomatoes but i'm using a mixture of tomatoes and tomatillos today the tomatillos perform a similar function in the sauce without reminding me of italian food so much hack those indiscriminately just to hasten their cooking stuff over here is browning pretty fast and that's good as someone who also cooks meat i kind of forget sometimes that this is my chance to get dark roasted flavor into a meatless dish the onions and peppers i want to get looking really brown before i start putting in more watery stuff like the tomatillos i can use their water to deglaze the pan a bit before anything burns and again i'll get that really cooked down and brown before i introduce the next watery thing which will be a 28 ounce can of whole tomatoes and their liquid like 800 grams deglaze with that before anything burns and i'll use my spoon to just smoosh the tomatoes up and get them cooking a little faster now put in my spices probably three or four tablespoons of masala for this much food i'm making enough to freeze and then because it makes almost everything better some white wine highly optional if you care about avoiding animal products i probably don't need to tell you that lots of wine is made with egg albumin or other animal proteins used as a clarifying agent there's legit vegan wine on the market just as there are legit vegan dietary supplements on the market like the ones from ritual the sponsor of this video one of the reasons i'm happy to work with ritual is they are i think far more upfront than their competitors about the fact that most people in the developed world probably get most of their essential nutrients just fine from food something like a ritual multivitamin is there for you if you have specific reasons to think you might need more i like that rituals algae-derived omega-3s in here don't give me any disgusting fish taste in my mouth ritual makes protein powders now too free of nearly anything anyone could be concerned about like dairy gluten all of that get 20 off your first month of ritual supplements with my link in the description ritual.com atom20 use my code adam20 save 20 thank you ritual alrighty the goal with this sauce is not to really reduce out a ton of water it's already quite dry the goal is to develop flavor and to break down the plant tissues such that we can squeeze more out of them when we pass this through a sieve so i might even add more wine or water to this as it cooks just to give it more time to cook before it gets too thick and burns let's check the chickpeas fish one out of there and give it a taste that's just about done which is right where i want it i want to cook these the rest of the way in the sauce again i've been finding that my digestion is better these days if i discard the cooking liquid and that really isn't aquafaba anyway the useful chickpea liquid that you get out of a can is much more concentrated those can just hang out until i'm ready for them let's get some rice going i would do about half a cup or 100 grams of basmati per person that's plenty of rice and i'm just washing it and draining repeatedly to get off the free starch coat i want fluffy rice today and today let's go with the old knuckle method for measuring the water i like this because it gets no measuring vessel dirty index fingertip to the surface of the rice get in enough water to come up to the crease behind your first knuckle hardly precise but good enough for the like billion people on this planet who use that trick all the time i'll throw in a big pinch of salt and this is my new favorite thing put some whole mustard seeds in with the rice they rehydrate in the same time as the rice and then they have this delicious pop between your teeth when you eat them give it one last stir turn on the heat cover bring to a boil and then what i usually do these days is take the heat all the way down low that's enough heat to finish cooking the rice for the 15 more minutes or so that it needs and then i won't even worry about turning the heat off the pot just becomes a warmer until i'm ready for rice the sauce has been cooking for about an hour it's looking mushy which is good it's ready to pass that same bowl that i already got dirty sieve in and dump in the sauce take a wooden spoon and grind swirl around pushing hard onto the sieve and it'll seem like nothing is happening at first but keep going you don't have to do this at all if you don't want it'd probably be healthier to just leave all of this good fiber in the food but i'm going for a really nice chickpea dinner today and this is going to make for a really velvety sauce make sure to scrape the stuff off the bottom of the sieve and that goes with the mostly cooked chickpeas and it might not seem like quite enough liquid but more will be provided by this pound of green beans yeah it's technically beans on beans but i think that chickpeas and green beans are an underrated combination these will provide the freshness and the crunch that the peas lack i'm just cutting them into fourths or fifths in they go and they'll release a lot of water as they soften speaking of soft coconut cream you can use a can of coconut milk it's basically the same product except it has a little less of the white coconut fat relative to the clear coconut water that's one 14 ounce 400 mil can in there i have another one that i might put in and this is super optional but especially if you don't eat any animals you got to get some yeast extract in your life two oxo meat-free imitation beef cubes which are basically just yeast extract and salt you might have to order these or a similar product on the internet but it is so worth it i have a whole video in the description about how they make yeast extract and why it's awesome it'll make this dish taste really meaty and substantial just let those dissolve and everything can simmer until perfectly tender my rice is done with that awesome mustard seed caviar on top i'll fluff that with a fork before it sets up too solid knuckle trick did just fine green beans went in like 15 minutes ago and by the time this cools to eating temperature it might be a little bit too thick so i'll loosen with more wine water would be fine give a green bean a taste by the time i actually get this on the table they'll be perfect and i think i'll do half of my remaining can of coconut cream though you could certainly go all in coconut cream can go in at the very end to taste it does not change very much during cooking the way the dairy cream does this needs more salt the salt in the stock cubes was not enough and i'm gonna do a little handful of sugar because i'm a grown man and i can do what i want stir that up and then we'll give it one more taste this time with some chickpeas i want to see if the sauce is sufficiently seasoning the chickpeas and now we need a hair more salt but otherwise we're good get some rice on the plate and i'm going to have my cilantro on the side today coriander leaves as they'd say in south asia and on goes those beautiful chickpeas something to remember when cooking dried chickpeas is they will firm up a bit as they cool to eating temperature so i try to get them feeling a little too soft in the pot and then for the sake of heterogeneity i've got some of this gorgeous kashmiri chili powder on the side cayenne would be fine instead this way everyone gets to have exactly the heat level they desire and it makes it so each bite has a little variability a stew comprised of very small pieces can be a little too homogeneous i think luscious creamy spicy meaty fresh toothsome this really checks a lot of boxes and it'll be almost as good frozen and then thawed we've probably got enough for at least 10 dinner size portions and i will be happy to have them when the next week night comes around

***RECIPE, MAKES 20-25...",29:02.6, classic italian-american ravioli with the cheese filling to make these efficiently you really need a pasta rolling machine and potentially some special crimping and cutting tools but if you're only feeding a few people you can totally do this with no special equipment at all we're gonna make enough for four people right now first pasta dough i'll crack two eggs into a mixing bowl and the third one i'm a separate the white i'll use to help bind my filling the yolk i'll put in the pasta egg pasta comes out especially nice when it has some extra yolks in it the yolk deepens the color and the flavor beat those nice and smooth then flour all-purpose flour is totally fine for egg pasta and i honestly have no idea why people measure it because all you do here is mix in as much flour as the eggs will take i guess i ended up putting in a cup and a half maybe 180 grams as soon as i've stirred in as much flour as possible i'll move this over to a cutting board and start kneading it with a little more flour the kneading will develop the gluten of course but it'll also help you get more flour into the dough than stirring can for machine rolled pasta i find you really have to knead in almost every particle of flour the dough will accept but it's fine if the dough is on the soft wet and sticky side if anything a wetter dough makes these ravioli easier to form because their seams are more likely to seal and they're more pliable so really as soon as this feels reasonably solid and smooth and only a little sticky to the touch i'm a stop i hand kneaded that for less than five minutes when i first started making fresh pasta my big mistake was not letting the dough rest you gotta cover it and just let it sit for like a half hour after that it's gonna roll way easier meanwhile we can get some sauce going i've got a shallot a carrot and a few garlic cloves peel and mince the alliums cut the carrot into long slices cut the slices into sticks cut across the sticks to yield a brunoise not everybody puts carrots in tomato sauce but i sure like them they make it chunkier and sweeter a wide pan on the heat with some olive oil it's amazing how quickly you can make a tomato sauce if you do a small amount in a very wide pan i'll throw in my veg and i'm on pretty high heat here because i'm available to continually stir this which should keep anything from burning until we've evaporated out a ton of water three or four minutes later everything is soft and starting to brown so in goes a can of whole plum tomatoes i like this brand because they're soft enough to just break up with your spoon i'll throw in a pinch of salt to start with some pepper and then a little white wine if you've got an open bottle around it's not necessary and if i stir this continuously i could cook this on medium medium-high heat and have sauce in less than 10 minutes i want to do other things with my time right now so i'm gonna reduce this to a simmer and just stir it occasionally while i work on my filling the classic italian american filling is chiefly ricotta cheese the full fat kind has considerably stronger flavor and softer texture i'm putting maybe a cup in there like 250 grams if you have some mozzarella it's nice to grate some of that in the matz really helps bind the filling so it doesn't just ooze out the second you cut into the ravioli and then a hard grating cheese for flavor i'm using pecorino for seasoning i'm just doing pepper salt and garlic powder though some lemon zest would be very nice too a lot of people use nutmeg i'm not into that but i won't judge you first you kind of have to cut this together to get the egg distributed through and then you can start stirring you could use whole egg in the filling with the yolk i'm just using the white because i'm making a small quantity and i don't need that much egg also this will increase the color contrast between the filling and the pasta the quantities are obviously not precise but for this much pasta you'll want to have about a cup and a half of filling ready to go i didn't make quite enough here i ended up having to mix up a tiny bit more later on i'll give that a tiny taste for seasoning though that comes with some risk of foodborne illness salt content seems good since all those cheeses are naturally salty done the flour particles in this dough have hydrated you can feel how much smoother the dough is these ravioli are going to be as simple to assemble as my sofa from the sponsor of this video all form we've been lounging around on this three-seater with chase for the better part of a year and she's holding up great all form leathers and fabrics are stain and scratch resistant great for pets kids and food i also work with all forms sister brand helix and just like a helix mattress all form sofas shipped to your door in boxes no moving truck needed another advantage of this is that you can buy nearly any configuration of seats and corners and chases and ottomans and stuff that you can imagine it's all modular so design whatever sofa you need for your space assembly is tool-free it might take you as little as 15 minutes for colors i chose the whiskey leather and walnut legs but you can mix and match a million different looks if i decide i want this to be wider i can order another seat and snap it in it's great and you can save 20 on your all form sofa with my link in the description 20 off with my link downstairs plus free shipping in the us and they'll come and take it back within 100 days if you decide you want a refund thank you all for don't forget to stir that sauce occasionally or it's going to burn tomatoes are filled with sugar first thing i'll do with the pasta dough is take it off the floured cutting board and put it on the clean counter i want to roll this out into a cylinder and that's way harder to do on flour it helps to have the dough stick to the clean counter just a little bit that's all i can do and that's good enough now here is my no rolling machine procedure use a knife to shave a thick coin of pasta off the cylinder flour it up and then use your fingers to pinch it out to a reasonably flat disc your fingers afford you a lot of control in terms of manipulating the shape and keeping it reasonably circular then you could just use a rolling pin or a little wooden dowel but i find a pint glass does a great job and it's easily at hand just finish rolling that out nice and thin keep it floured or else it's going to stick to the glass or the board or both grab a spoonful of filling to me the right amount always feels like a little less than is my instinct to deposit grab the side and drape it over then pinch the pasta together right up to the lump of filling this is slavic pierogi technique that i'm borrowing here and it works great for ravioli indeed you could boil it just like that but if you're afraid that no one is going to click on your video if it doesn't have a pretty thumbnail you could trim off three sides like that that gets you three-fourths of the traditional square ravioli shape let me show you that again slice off a coin flour it smoosh with your fingers into a round use a glass or anything else smoothing around to roll it thin really flour the pasta aggressively or you can have sticking problems a little spoonful of filling goes right in the center try really hard to not touch the filling with your fingers that's going to make the whole process way messier fold the dough over on itself and start pinching it down right around the filling bulge that helps you expel any air pockets before you get the outer region sealed off press really hard if you don't the seal might fail during cooking if you want to be pretty yeah trim off the three sides there almost a square ravioli it might not look like it but the ravioli i'm shaping here are going to be very big egg pasta expands a ton when it boils these are going to swell by like 50 so if you want them small you got to start with them really small but honestly making them big just saves on labor if the seams are not sticking you could always wet your finger and use a little water as glue again because i made this a pretty wet dough to begin with i'm not having any trouble sealing these off is this a lot of work yeah this would be a special occasion dinner at my house for sure but it's fun and fresh egg pasta is shockingly delicious and different from other pasta also i found that i'm far more likely to actually make it if i use one of these no roller methods i have a pasta roller but it's a pain to get out and set up and it's a real pain to clean if i was trying to make and freeze 100 ravioli yeah i'd use my roller but for 20 big ones nah the pint glass is better i think beautiful my sauce is done and i've had a big pot of water coming to a boil when i make fresh pasta i find that i need to salt my water more aggressively than i would for dry pasta maybe twice as much salt i'm not sure why that's the case maybe fresh pasta absorbs less maybe it's just thicker i don't know but it's true in the ravioli go one at a time to keep them from sticking to each other these only take a few minutes and fresh egg pasta is very forgiving in terms of cooking time you don't have to nail it like you do with dry pasta once they float they're gonna stay nice and al dente for a few minutes what i look for is the color change you can see how the pasta in the thicker center is still a little darker yellow in part that's because it's still a hair undercooked because the center is less transparent it's always going to appear darker but i look for that center starting to go a little more pale and then i figure they're perfect these took three minutes drain them out and i'm going to retain a good amount of the pasta water in there to thin out my frankly over reduced tomato sauce if you're not good at eyeballing the amount of water to leave at the bottom of the pot you can always just catch some in a glass in the sink and then pour in exactly how much you want pasta water is full of starch and it lends a really nice silky quality to sauces i'm throwing a big handful of whole basil leaves but almost any herb in any configuration would be great and there you go that's a celebratory dinner for four right there or maybe five or six with some salad and a loaf of crusty bread to mop up the extra sauce listen let them fill up on the bread now mechanical ravioli assemblers can get proportionally more cheese into the center but i honestly prefer this proportion anyway especially if you use a more flavorful cheese in addition to the ricotta you have to push pretty hard with your fork because the egg pasta is deliciously firm and chewy despite all that fork pressure you can see the mozzarella and the egg white are holding the filling in place it doesn't just slip out the instant you cut through the ravioli this is probably my favorite dinner growing up and every time i make it i wonder why i don't do it more often i mean i know why it's because it's a lot of work unless you live in a place where you can buy really good fresh ravioli if you do awesome buy it if not try this maybe you'll realize that the store-bought ravioli you thought was good wasn't

Michel Roux Jr.'s recipe for bread charlotte, on...",29:02.6, some years ago i was watching a bbc cookery program and the delightful chef michelle jr made something that he called a bread charlotte and i've wanted to try it ever since charlotte usually refers to some kind of fruit dessert encased in cake slices you press that into a mold and then you bake it again chef michelle did a savory charlotte with a duck stew encased in little fingers of bread i love the concept as a fun individual savory pie to serve guests it's surprisingly easy to do and you could fill it with any stew recipe you like i'm doing a chicken stew that i hope is going to be a bit more approachable than chef michelle's recipe which really relies on the fats left over from the duck i'm using clarified butter instead of duck fat you can buy clarified butter of course but it's easy to make from regular butter yourself for my recipe i'd say go ahead and do a full pound of butter 454 grams that's twice what you see here i think you're going to want the full pound you literally just let it melt over lowish heat and then you'll see the 15 to 20 percent water content of the butter start boiling out do it gently where stuff will burn we've cooked this about 10 minutes and now it's moving on to the foaming stage which you will definitely notice when it happens it looks and sounds and smells very different from the boiling we had before the foam indicates that almost all the water is gone and if you want something a little more like indian style ghee you let the milk solids in there brown just a little bit before you take it off the heat a paper towel in a sieve is a perfectly good filter for clarified butter you could certainly use some nice olive oil or something for this recipe but i would not use melted whole butter the outside of the pie would not crisp up as nice or worse the milk solids in there might burn no more solids left in here though just pure slightly toasty milk fat before i do anything else i'm gonna get an ounce of dried mushroom steeping in water about 30 grams of dried porcini i'll put in like three cups of water in there 700 mils enough water to keep everything easily submerged as you heat it up the mushrooms are going to expand i'm just giving that like five minutes in the microwave and then the mushrooms can just sit around in there and soften up while we do other stuff i've got four chicken thighs the finest chicken piece for stew if you can get them boneless and skin off that's great i'm just sloppily cutting out the thigh bones because i don't need perfect whole thighs i need pieces and i'm going smaller than i'd normally go on stew pieces i think this dish is a little bit more delicate than a big hearty stew enough salt and pepper to get every piece really well seasoned and then enough flour to coat everything a handful chicken is just kind of slippery and the flour coating helps it to merge with the sauce in a stew it'll also thicken the stew though one good thing to do is separate out all the pieces before you cook them if i don't do this they tend to merge into one giant meatball in the pan and then you can't brown them very well my widest pan on medium heat i might as well steal some of that clarified butter to brown all of these and as long as all the meat is in one layer i really don't think you have to worry about crowding the pan yeah you have to boil out some water before things can really start browning but that's fine with chicken thigh because it's virtually impossible to overcook chicken thigh it's not like steak where you have to brown the surface really fast before you overcook the interior as soon as these are sufficiently browned they should release pretty easily from the pan just a little nudge from the spoon but it really doesn't matter if they get torn up as you are flipping it's a stew whether the brown stuff is on the piece or in the pan it doesn't really matter it's all going to end up dissolved in the stew while side b cooks i'll peel and mince two or three shallots you could use an onion but shallots cook way faster so i can just do them right in here with the chicken i don't need to take the meat out to make room i have to worry about the fond burning before the shallots are done they cook in seconds stir in a squeeze of tomato paste the easiest way to boost almost any stew i am in imminent danger of burning the fawn so time to deglaze with the mushroom stock and i'll throw in the whole mushrooms too some people pass that through a coffee filter first to get out any sand that was clinging to the mushrooms maybe that's a bigger problem on other kinds of dried mushrooms because it's never really bothered me with these scrape the pan clean reduce the heat to a simmer and then we'll give that a head start while we cut up some carrots i don't feel like peeling them today and i think i'm just going to do simple slices again this is a little more delicate stew so i want smaller pieces and i don't care if they're a little over soft by the end stir those in and it might seem like there's not enough liquid but a ton is about to come pouring out of the carrots so just let everything simmer and now we've got a moment of downtime so how about some tunes courtesy of the sponsor of this video cove audio this has been my go-to bluetooth speaker for years now it links up to my phone in a snap can you believe this guy on soundcloud still hasn't been corded by the major labels i mean he's almost as visionary as the cove split speaker boom the smartphone era has unfortunately been the death of stereo audio now i can actually get true stereo sound from my phone you can put the halves like 30 feet apart they have a built-in microphone so you can talk to your phone i can run them all day on a single charge they get really loud and they're water resistant which makes them excellent for the kitchen i can just wash that sauce right off cove is running a january special 67 off this speaker with my link and code in the description it comes in some cool colors now too use my link in the description my code ar 67 at checkout to save 67 on your cove split speaker thank you cove alrighty we've had some evaporation so now there's room in the pan for like half a bottle of red wine you could just use water or stock instead enough to keep everything almost submerged as it simmers and i'm going to put in two or three envelopes of powdered gelatin this will be a secondary thickener and it'll give the sauce a really sexy smooth texture that chef michelle got from using reduced veal stock the powder clumps in hot liquid but as long as you can stir it in aggressively and let it cook a while longer the lumps will dissolve now bread i went to the bakery counter in the morning and i asked if they had any day-old bread they were happy to unload it on me for almost no money the bread doesn't have to be stale but it's easier to cut the crust off if the bread is firm you don't have to cut the crust off but it'll make the finished shell a lot prettier the crusts would make them kind of lumpy i'm not going to waste the crust i'm going to let it dry another day and then blitz it into breadcrumbs now i'll slice this basically as thin as i can and then cut the slices into wide strips chef michelle called them soldiers of bread the strips are just easier to position as you're lining the mold this bread is kind of delicate so i'm not getting perfect soldiers from all the slices that's not soldering doesn't matter we can use the little pieces to patch holes okay my ghee has solidified at room temperature which is why i strained it into a microwave-safe container much better chef michelle made one big pie in a large ceramic pudding basin i'm doing individual pies in my fiestaware soup bowls google your bowls to find out if they're oven safe but most ceramic dishes are they were fired in a kiln you just dip the bread strip into the fat and then place it with the greasy side facing the bowl it should stick the key is don't soak the bread in fat it's just a quick little dip there's tons of ways that you could do this to create decorative effects just follow your imagination no matter what i do my pies are not going to be super pretty because this bread has an airy open crumb which is going to allow some of the sauce to seep through if you want a really pretty uniform color on the outside you got to use bread with a dense crumb like chef michelle used he actually baked his own milk bread for this pie i will end up needing that second loaf because remember we need extra bread to cover the tops which will end up being the bottoms stew looks good nice and thick i can feel the chicken pieces and the carrots have softened the chicken's been simmering maybe 45 minutes i'll taste the sauce and adjust seasoning needs more salt and pepper and i'm going to stir in some balsamic vinegar mostly because this stew is going to get cooked again in the oven and that's going to knock back the brightness so i want it a little too acidic at this stage if i hadn't used the wine i would use even more balsamic now heat is off at the last second i'm gonna put in like a cup of peas straight from the freezer and i'll snip in some fresh soft thyme that i've got but any herb is fine you stir in frozen peas at the last second and you reduce the degree to which they'll be overcooked in the finished pie that stew would be perfect in a bowl right now and frankly it would be a much more sensible dinner but because we are packing this in carb casings i think i need to add a little water back into the sauce the bread is going to absorb liquid some of the water is going to evaporate in the oven and the sauce could end up over reduced and gloopy if we don't keep it a little too wet at this stage now we can start filling up the bread bowls be sure to get sauce as well as chunks or the pies are gonna end up being dry on the inside you can see why it's good to have smaller chunks for this stew smaller chunks fit better into the bowls if you have any leftover stew just eat it but i ended up having the perfect amount time now to top these with bread greasy side facing up this side doesn't have to be pretty because it's actually going to be the bottom of the pie no one is ever going to see it i should say i'm using salted butter for this if you're using unsalted butter i would put like a teaspoon of salt in with your pound of butter at the beginning of the clarifying process so that it can dissolve in the water before the water is gone i want a seasoned crust on my pie and i imagine you do too covered in foil to keep them from drying out and in they go to a 400 fahrenheit 200c oven it may be possible to do this in metal bowls but i think you'd have to experiment with a lower temperature metal is way more heat conductive and i worry that your crust would burn at this heat after like half an hour i'll take the foil off so the tops can brown otherwise they'll end up being mushy on the bottom of the pie i baked these just under an hour total i could see the stew bubbling under the crust so i know they're plenty hot in this form you could hold these for a few hours i would just put them back in the oven for like 20 minutes to crisp the shell again i think they're firm enough to turn out when they've cooled to the point where you can do this with your bare hands plate on top flip and lift that is a very hearty winter meal for one there the outside of the bread shell is shockingly delicious it's a little crispy it's soft underneath just dynamite and again you could do this with all kinds of fillings do a mushroom burgundy on and use olive oil and be vegan you can see chef michelle's far more elegant pie in that old bbc show it's linked in the description and as the brits would say tuck in

My old video...",29:02.6, pizza dough like most bread is chiefly flour water yeast and salt but lots of recipes including my own call for some amount of oil and some amount of sugar what do those add-ons actually do well according to my experiments which i'm now going to show you sugar makes the dough sweeter obviously but more noticeably than that sugar causes the dough to retain water during baking which could be a good or a bad thing oil makes the dough more rich and moist obviously it also makes it bake a little faster but oil weakens the dough which is the negative way to say it the positive way to say it would be oil tenderizes the dough none of these things are objectively good or bad it all depends on what kind of effect you're going for with the possible exception of yeast i tried using less yeast zero yeast extra yeast and my findings there were surprisingly conclusive it sounds good tastes more yeasty really yeasty it was a gummy texture it smells like an armpit oh oh no i'm not doing that up to a point more yeast is good those are my big picture findings but i learned a lot of other little interesting things along the way let me show you my methodology eight different sample doughs in eight separate containers gotta keep them each labeled through the whole process each is going to be built on half a cup of water 118 mils that's about what i normally use for a home oven size pizza top lefty there is my reference recipe my normal pizza dough which has about half a teaspoon of granulated sugar per pizza some of these are going to get less sugar no sugar double sugar than yeast normally i'd do about half a teaspoon of active dry yeast for a single pizza some of these are going to get less yeast no yeast double east and i'm isolating the variables here each of these doughs is different from my reference dough in only one aspect that's important right now check this out i'm going to slow the video back down to real time and you're going to see the yeast in top righty there bloom conspicuously that is happening in real time right there and that's the sample with double yeast not one of the other samples is blooming so spectacularly the lesson there is don't assume your yeast are dead if they don't bubble and foam really dramatically it depends how much yeast are in there relative to the water these are all showing less dramatic signs of life even bottom lefty which has no sugar for the yeast to eat the yeast have their own internal energy stores just like you and i do and their metabolic processes resume as soon as we get them wet with or without sugar normally i would just eyeball the olive oil but i'm guessing i do about a teaspoon per pizza so some of these will get half that much oil no oil double oil etc salt i'm keeping standard half a teaspoon of morton kosher for each flour is going to be constant too 150 grams of king arthur bread flour per dough that's about a cup because bread flour is heavier than all purpose flour protein is heavy this is going to give me a dough hydration of about 80 percent which is pretty wet and what i have been favoring lately since i have moved to a no knead or low knead dough i'm not even touching these with my hands i'm just getting each one stirred up with a spoon until all the flour is wet the most bread flour you can possibly stir in with a spoon that's generally going to get you the perfect hydration for no need pizza dough already there are differences the samples with more yeast are noticeably wetter even though they have the same exact amount of water and flour today's video is really a practical experiment not a science explainer i will give you my best guess as to what is happening science-wise active dry yeast that is sold like this in the store is generally packaged with an emulsifier to help the yeast rehydrate inside your dough my guess is that emulsifier may be helping the whole dough to suck more water into its constituent particles and that gives it the effect of seaming at this stage more wet even though it has the same amount of flour and water but that's just a guess these are all done time to pack them up and it occurs to me that the labels are upside down from your perspective that's quality film making regula and then like i normally do i'm going to put these straight into the fridge for a slow cold rise which i'm quite confident results in superior flavor but we can a b test that another day here's an a b test that we can do right now with the sponsor of this video surf shark without surf shark i cannot stream the

enter adam or guccia at checkout all one word 83 off thank you surf shark so anyway for pizza dough i would normally do a bulk ferment that's where you mix up dough for a whole bunch of pizzas all in one giant ball and then you just let it sit for a while let it autolyze let it ferment at least part of the way then you punch it down break it down into individual doughs maybe fold them a little bit and then rise those individually to bake later here i obviously could not do a bulk ferment because all eight recipes are different but i still want to give them a second rise which is why i'm pulling them out folding them a few times because that's all the needing a dough this wet could possibly require and then i'm oiling the containers so that i'll be able to get the finished dough out without really tearing it up folding the dough part way through the fermentation process results in a fluffier bake which i'm honestly not even sure i prefer for pizza so it's certainly not necessary not for a flatbread anyway back in the fridge for at least a day but i like to do many days for up to a week and maybe even beyond you get progressively more intense flavor with the more fermentation that happens as you go i have a whole video about that in the description where you can see a dough at one day old two days old three days old etc these are now five days old and i'm gonna bake them it is pizza dough but i'm not baking pizza with it i'm baking what my kids call pizza bread gently pull the dough out without deflating it turn it upside down so the bubbly side is on top smear that with olive oil top with black pepper coarse salt and garlic powder bake at maximum heat on a hot stone or steel this will be less wasteful than baking eight full pizzas i can bake four at a time so all four will get a similar bake and that'll help us isolate the ingredient variables plus with pizza bread you can assess the dough itself a little bit more easily it's more subtle characteristics will not be drowned out by the sauce and the cheese and all that gotta keep the label with the bread at all times or this entire exercise will have been for nothing here's my reference dough my standard recipe teaspoon of oil half a teaspoon each of sugar and yeast tastes great fluffy yet moist and chewy nice fermented yeasty flavor and a very subtle sweetness that i only notice after i've been chewing on it for a sec in fact let's first consider the effects of sugar on the dough as you saw all seven of my doughs that had yeast in them were able to rise just fine with or without sugar this is because flour generally has enzymes in it that will break the starch molecules down into fermentable sugar is that the yeast can actually eat and ferment and all that kind of good stuff so sugar is absolutely not necessary like here is my normal dough with half a teaspoon of sugar here is my dough with zero sugar the zero sugar dough puffed up almost as tall in the fridge though it feels less sticky less sticky adam that's me leaving notes for myself which i'm sure sounds totally normal and not at all crazy once baked the zero sugar dough looks a lot browner but i think that mostly had to do with its position in the oven it is generally agreed upon that sugar enhances browning in bread but this experiment was not able to isolate that particular variable anyway we can talk about the internal taste and texture difference which is very noticeable and it has very little to do with sweetness i can vaguely taste at the end of the bite i can taste the relative lack of sweetness nevertheless pizza dough with no sugar in it tastes really different at least the texture is different it is fluffier and it is chewier sugar weakens gluten and it retains water during baking i think the lack of sugar here allowed more water to convert to steam and the stronger gluten network was more able to capture that steam in the form of bubbles hence fluffier texture and the taste of the zero sugar dough is more bready sorry that's the best thing that i can think of to describe it it's more of the just kind of purer cleaner taste of plain bread i would not say that i prefer it to my standard dough that has a little sugar in it to me they're just two totally different things with their own pros and cons though too much sugar is definitely a thing this dough got double sugar a full teaspoon and you can see it puffed up a little more we got a gassier fermentation out of it and it is very sticky that would be much more challenging to shape into a thin crust pizza and have any hope of sliding it off the peel into the oven once baked you can see the difference in the interior texture which is very moist and dense almost like it was under baked lauren was not a fan it tastes like it's a savory bread that is wanting to be a cinnamon roll yeah and that's not because it tasted sweet it did not taste particularly sweet to me but sugar holds on to water so less water was able to escape as steam during baking you also have less steam puffing up the texture and you have a weaker gluten network that is less able to expand into bubbles in response to that vapor pressure so the resulting bread is texturally cakey sugar is responsible for that cakey texture at least in parts and that could actually be nice in say a thick crust pizza but for a typical thin crust now i don't think i'm ever going to use more than half a teaspoon of sugar per small pizza ever again how about oil sample number two here has absolutely no oil inside it just a thin coating on the outside it seemed to rise just as high as my reference recipe but the raw dough was noticeably stickier maybe that's just a lack of the lubricating effect of oil and despite baking in the hottest corner of my oven it baked up lighter than the others in the same batch except for that one burned patch there really the zero oil dough needed another minute or two in the oven and this makes sense oil speeds up cooking this is because oil can get much hotter than water can liquid water and because oil is such an effective thermal interface i have a whole video about that in the description but if you look past that slight under baked taste and texture the interior of the no oil bread is quite nice again i would just describe it as more bready than my typical pizza dough more of the pure taste and texture of bread without the extra richness and moisture of the oil they're very fluffy yep that makes sense fat weakens gluten so without fat this was able to form bigger bubbles in the oven it got more oven spring from the steam the resulting texture is pillowy which again i would not say is intrinsically better or worse than my normal dough it's just a different vibe over here is my dough with double oil actually i think i might have given it triple oil the raw dough is not especially sticky to the touch but it is softer i can tell that if i tried to stretch this out thin it would probably rip fat weakens gluten so that makes sense bake that up very crispy bottom on that it looks pretty similar inside but wow does it taste different oh you can tell it just falls apart in your mouth yeah fat is the other thing that gets you cakey texture fat weakens gluten so you get this very tender very yielding bread your teeth kind of cut through that bread like a hot knife through butter which again could be a very nice thing in a thick crust pizza so i'm not gonna call this objectively good or bad but i'ma get much less ambivalent when we start talking about yeast this is my batch with half my normal amount of yeast you can see that we got a feeble rise with just a quarter teaspoon of yeast and the underside has less of the bubbly surface that holds oil and crisps up really nice when i do pizza bread so boo to that the low yeast dough bakes up a little bit flatter and you can see the bottom layer is gummy and doughy i think that's because our feeble fermentation did not create enough seed bubbles in there there were no little pockets for steam to build up and expand and the taste tastes like bath water or something i don't know yeah it just doesn't taste as good no here's the thing much of the stuff in bread doesn't taste very good warm wet flour doesn't taste good i think that's the like bathwater taste that lauren was talking about what makes it taste good is high heat which you only get on the exterior of the bread on the interior what makes flour taste good is fermentation the chemical products of fermentation taste great and we simply have less of them in this bread that we baked with less yeast we can take that to its logical extreme in this dough that has zero yeast i thought it might ferment a bit flour has some yeast in it naturally the environment in your house has yeast in it naturally and if we had left this at room temperature it probably would have puffed up a bit like a sourdough starter but not in the fridge not enough yeast to overcome the cold it feels like play-doh and here it is baked it puffed up a little bit in the oven purely from steam but i still don't really want to eat it in the name of science oh it smells like an armpit oh oh no i'm not doing that oh [Laughter] no yeah basically that tasted like a raw flour tortilla cook a tortilla and it tastes pretty good because effectively it has no inside only outside and the outside got high heat which made it taste good this massive unfermented interior just tastes like warm wet flour which is strikingly similar to warm wet dog hair even grosser than i was expecting but here's where things get really interesting my batch with double yeast normally i would use about half a teaspoon of yeast for a small home oven size pizza this one got a full teaspoon it did not rise up that much more than my reference recipe it is noticeably stickier and more delicate to handle it baked up a little bit lighter i think that was just oven position though the interior is maybe a little fluffier than the reference recipe but what really stands out is the flavor the flavor of the double yeast dough was outstanding by far our favorite it was just so yeasty and fermented and funky and and sour it was noticeably sour which i realized not everybody might like but i sure did certainly there's got to be an upper limit on yeast too much fermentation definitely weakens the gluten and potentially creates too much gas this causes breads to overproof and collapse but that doesn't really matter when you're making a flat bread like pizza or pizza bread one of the many reasons i like making pizza and naan and other flatbreads here at home is because flatbreads are just way less fussy they leave you a much wider margin of error than tall breads tall breads a lot more can go wrong and i generally leave them to the professionals really the only downside to extra yeast that i see in pizza making is the gluten problem too much yeast and it will not be able to stretch out super thin into a thin crust pizza without tearing but for a thick crust pizza i'm going double ease from now on i'm sure there's an upper limit on that but i have not yet hit it in contrast my children have hit their upper limit on pizza bread it's somewhere between three and four loaves i'll notify the science journals immediately
"Weeknight 'fun size' paella | streamlined Valencian-style, with green beans and chicken wings",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WfYjmrH9gSw/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLD_CY-Xh95ZQbHPM-Fu-j8V6fpUBQ,WfYjmrH9gSw,"9 minutes, 27 seconds","Thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this video! Go to Squarespace.com for a free trial, and when you’re ready to launch, go to http://squarespace.com/ragusea and add code “RAGUSEA"" at...",29:02.6, this video is sponsored by squarespace so what i'm trying to do here is get as close as possible to a traditional valencian paella while at the same time i'm keeping everything super fast and quick and small it's a weeknight paella with a manageable ingredient list for a typically small contemporary household spain's national dish here was originally invented to feed massive teams of farm hands which is why paella is traditionally cooked in these giant specialized paella pans which is technically redundant because paella means pan and valencian but anyway i'm just using a 10 inch or 25 centimeter diameter saute pan that'll feed mom and dad and two little kids but if you need more food you could double my quantities and use a 12 12-inch pan the defining spice and coloring of course is saffron the painstakingly harvested stigma and styles of certain crocus flowers quite expensive but you only need a pinch that sachet was an eighth of a gram and honestly i could have used half of it for this much food lots of the recipes i've read from spain tell you to toast the saffron sometimes in a dry pan like i'm doing here sometimes they do it in the hot oil later on i'm not sure this intensifies the flavor as much as promised but it's easy to do so let's go with it out it goes into my microwave safe measuring jug and while some recipes tell you to bash it up in a mortar and pestle i'm just gonna do as much as i can with my finger i'm using two total cups of liquid just under half a liter and half of that is gonna be plain water check how powerful that pigment is already saffron will stain your clothes your countertops be careful with it the other half of my liquid is gonna be white wine because it's me but i've read lots of spanish recipes that do use some wine so of course you could use stock instead and i'm just going to heat this for a couple of minutes in the microwave again tradition has it that steeping the saffron in hot liquid will help you extract more out of it eventually it's going into hot liquid anyway in the pan so i'm not convinced this makes a big difference but again it's easy especially if you use the microwave so sure pan is already hot in goes some olive oil and really if you're using anything other than a real paella pan you are making a mini paella fun size therefore it helps to think small with all of your ingredients hence chicken wings traditional valencian paella has big whole chunks of chicken maybe thighs chopped in half plus bone-in chunks of rabbit and or pork you don't have to use any meat at all if you don't want to but six or eight chicken wings will give you that traditional vibe of bone-in skin-on chicken pieces but they'll cook much faster and they won't take up too much space in such a little pan i seasoned them heavily and now i'm going to get them basically fully cooked while i prep my vegetables traditional recipes often call for a grated onion i'm using a shallot because i'm making a small quantity and i don't need a whole big onion and i'm just finely mincing it because that's easier than grating it and minced shallot cooks in seconds i'm mincing it up with my garlic a few cloves as fine as reasonably possible skin on chicken pieces are ready to flip when they release pretty easily from the pan very nice color on those again i want these pretty much done before everything else goes in because they're really not going to stew for very long with the rice and everything by the way if i was doing a vegan version i might fry some butter beans in the oil instead lima beans canned and then drain limas are definitely traditional in paella even though i'm skipping them today for the sake of simplicity i'm also skipping the artichoke hearts which i'd probably make time for if i wasn't also using meat at my store they sell these little sweet peppers in bulk so that's what i'm using a hot pepper would not be traditional and would overwhelm the saffron so maybe dice up half a small bell pepper if you can't use one of these or some of those little bottled diced pimentos would be good instead and then my main veg is going to be a big handful of green beans that i bought bulk at the store very traditional in valencia and paella i'm just cutting them in half to make them a little easier to eat and stir around again butter beans and artichoke hearts would be traditional as well frozen peas work great put them in straight out of the freezer just when you're putting the rice in awesome and now that my chicken pieces are almost cooked through i'm just softening up my sofrito in the pan spanish sofrito is onion garlic and sweet peppers generally with tomato traditionally you might grate some fresh whole tomatoes discard the skins and then cook that down with the other veg until it forms a thick dark sauce a paste of tomato if you will which is why i'm just using a squeeze of tomato paste and i think it's going to taste pretty similar traditionally you might brown the green beans a little bit in the hot oil to do a good job of that i would really have to dump out the chicken and everything else first lots of paella recipes involve frying things in stages in batches taking them out and putting them back in again i'm going for simplicity here so i'm just giving the green beans like a two minute head start before i pour in my liquid if you can't get saffron by the way just use like a teaspoon of sweet paprika lots of people use paprika in addition to the saffron if i'm gonna spring for the saffron i want to taste it and the taste is kind of subtle so i'm just doing the saffron and nothing else salt i'm going to add salt to this broth until it tastes almost twice as salty as i want it why because it's going to donate tons of salt to the rice unwashed rice we need the free starch coat clinging to the rice to bind this dish any short grain rice could work like risotto rice this is purportedly a real spanish paella rice it'll tell you on the bag how much liquid it can absorb some varieties absorb way more water than others i'd say just follow whatever ratio is recommended on the package i'm doing a cup of rice to two cups liquid you really don't have to nail the ratio because we're going to have ample opportunity to either add water or boil it away later once you get the rice stirred in some people cover it some people don't but either way you just let it simmer and you never stir it again this is the main difference between paella and risotto risotto you stir you let that freeze starch coat and the particular starch composition of short grain rice thicken up that liquid until you have a nice creamy stew paella is more like a casserole than a stew you just let it cook and set into one semi-solid mass that's also perhaps a reason to steep the saffron ahead of time you can't really stir it around and get it evenly distributed once the rice goes in when the rice grains have all plumped up a bit you can just reach in and taste them to assess their doneness if they're still kind of crunchy you can easily just drizzle some extra water wherever needed maybe season the water first just to be safe i still had some saffron lining that jug and i'll just drizzle some of that wherever i seem to have dry patches if on the other hand you seem to have put in too much water relative to the rice that's okay too because here's the last step when the rice is still a little undercooked you jack up the heat to boil out any excess water thus allowing you to create the sokarat i'm sure i'm not pronouncing that the way that you would in valencia but the sakurat is this layer of brown fried rice at the bottom of the paella on my stove which is not super powerful i find that i need to crank the burner all the way up and then just use my nose you can smell when the browning happens and then i might pull it off the heat when i just start to smell burning i use that same trick when i'm making pan pizza on the stovetop off it comes and then like any casserole you really got to let it rest for at least 15 minutes before scooping give that starch matrix time to cool and solidify a bit if you need to keep it warm for a long time apparently it's traditional to cover this with a damp towel though i'm sure a lid would be fine when it's time to scoop i recommend something wide and rigid that will allow you to really scrape that sakurat off the bottom for my taste i think i could have left that on the high heat for even longer that brown layer on the bottom is widely regarded as the best bit of the paella you might be wondering where's the seafood well apparently seafood is not very traditional in valencian paella which in valencia they would say is the traditional paella again i'm going for simple here so i'm happy to leave out ingredients though i'm definitely doing the traditional lemon wedge served on the side you squeeze that over to your liking see heterogeneity in food is not just something ragusia made up it's part of so many great traditional foods for example the use of bone-in meat chunks or bivalves still in their shells that makes it so that you're not just scooping porridge into your face there's little bits within the dish that you pick up and you eat

...",29:02.6, image candy or cut rock candy hard candies with little designs in their cross sections i believe i've designed a good procedure for making these at home with no special candy shop equipment no special ingredients and no assistant helping you out getting a good design as you can see i am so not there yet but i figured i'd show you the method and maybe you can do better than me mostly i've just watched thousands of videos from candy shops in east asia where these things have apparently gotten crazy popular and i just wanted to have the experience of doing it myself just for fun for flavor i'm going to juice a couple of lemons and a few limes the professionals use flavor extracts combined with pure powdered citric or malic acid for tartness not everybody can buy that at the store but you can probably get lemons and or limes one cup of juice to 87 mils could you use something like orange instead i think you would find the result was not acidic enough you would need to add pure citric acid crystals to balance the sugar and you can buy them on the internet strain that into a pan bits of pulp would create structural weak points in the candy into a wide pan because the idea here is to evaporate excess water out of the juice as quickly as possible at the lowest temperature possible if you boil this hard the flavor would come out super cooked and kind of gross if you just barely simmer it nice and slow you'll retain that fresh fruit flavor i'm gonna turn the heat off now because by the time i actually use this it will have reduced down even more to a syrup if you over reduce it you might have to add a little water back in just to get it dissolved off the pan surface time for the candy a tall small pot into which i will put three cups of granulated sugar 600 grams at most a cup of water it doesn't have to be precise because we're going to boil it all out again we just need enough to get the dissolution process started and then i'm going to do about a cup or half a bottle of light corn syrup maybe 300 grams any so-called invert syrup should work and the quantity does not have to be precise i know many of the pros just use straight granulated sugar and water if you do that you run the risk of your hot syrup seizing which is this rapid recrystallization reaction that turns your syrup into a solid hot rock in a matter of seconds it happened to me twice while developing this recipe follow me on instagram for more catastrophic failures this is why i started adding the invert syrup which inhibits crystallization i'm also putting the lid on for the first phase of cooking this causes steam to condense on top and run back down the sides dissolving any seed crystals that may form on the rim that might not be necessary with the corn syrup in there but i don't feel like taking chances we're on high heat and the goal is to boil almost all the water out at which point the temperature will be around 310 fahrenheit 154c the hard crack stage make sure the thermometer is not touching the bottom of the pan or you'll get a false reading as soon as i'm in the neighborhood of 310 fahrenheit i will take this off the heat the pros would then pour this out onto a special cooling table you can get a similar effect at home by pouring it onto a lightly greased baking sheet with a tall lip on it but i've found that it's much easier and cleaner at home to simply cool this down in the pot it'll take a while but we're not doing this in a commercial context where we need to maximize productivity we're doing this for fun and it's also good to move slowly when you are working with hot syrup at home this would burn you horrifically if it got on your skin right now as it cools you'll have to start scraping it off the sides of the pot it'll solidify along the sides just bring that stuff into the center where it will melt again when it's cooled to the point where i can just barely stir it anymore i will stir in my citrus reduction if you were to stir this in while the syrup was still ultra hot you would destroy those fresh fruit flavors that we worked so hard to preserve so you stir it in at the last minute you can already see we're starting to work some air into that syrup which is what we're gonna do next we've gotta get this candy as puffy and fluffy as my mattress from the sponsor of this video helix sleep let's thank them helix is a premium mattress in a box you don't need a truck to move it they ship it right to your door free within the us break the seal and it blows up like a balloon i've had this one since last spring though i just got a helix bed frame to go with it like all helix products it's great value for your money it's shipped to my door and it was a snap to set up that mattress is the helix dusk how did i know which one to get i took their quiz online i told them how lauren and i like to sleep side or stomach firm or soft we do not agree on these things so helix recommended the perfect compromise which is a real foam and spring mattress don't be thrown by the fact that it came in a box it's not some glorified air mattress it's real and i sleep way better on this thing than on the old-fashioned mattress that we used to have from a furniture store they give you a 100 night trial if it's not the right match for you they'll come and take it back use my link in the description to save up to 200 on your helix sleep mattress plus you get two free pillows that's helixsleep.com thank you helix okay when the syrup has cooled to the point where you're not going to be able to scrape it all out of the pot that's the temperature we're looking for i'm just scraping whatever i can get out onto my stone countertop as soon as it's down i'll push it around to make sure it doesn't stick to my counter which it definitely will do if it's too hot you could pour it onto a ceramic plate to be safe especially if your countertop is not heat safe use a plate you don't care about if it cracks but it's certainly easier to work the candy right on the counter if you can it is still way too hot to touch for any length of time i'm just touching it for an instant so i can get it folded over on itself the part that was touching the counter is now too firm and it needs to move back to the center where it can re-liquefy you've got to work constantly to keep the whole mass in thermal equilibrium and it's time now to pull the candy stretch it out fold it over on itself repeat you'll note that i'm pulling it quickly and then throwing it down on the counter picking it up quickly before it sticks to the counter stretching it out and throwing it back down again before it burns me i can only touch it for a second at a time those are just normal food grade latex gloves from the grocery store that i'm wearing they give hardly any protection from heat but if you ended up with hot syrup stuck to you you can at least tear the gloves off i am used to working with very hot things with my bare hands and i have an intuitive sense of how long i can touch these things before they injure me if you are not similarly experienced i don't think you should make this candy though there are heat resistant candy making gloves that you can buy online the goal of pulling the syrup is to work microscopic air bubbles into the structure of the candy as it cools and solidifies if you don't work in the air hard candy is inevitably hard you just have to suck on it to dissolve it if you stretch it until it is puffy you get a structure that you can crunch through very easily once cooled as you can see it's looking kind of satiny and white that means we've got plenty of air in there the pros mix in their coloring before they do the stretching i have found that when working at home by myself it's easier to stretch the whole batch at once break it down and then add my colors chunk by chunk how by keeping the candy soft in the microwave the pros have assistants who roll the candy around on giant heat tables that maintain the perfect temperature for keeping the candy workable my home gas stove top is too hot it just melts the candy even the lowest heat you can keep it workable by microwaving it literally two or three seconds at a time flipping it giving it another two or three seconds the heat will build mostly at the center of the lump i suspect this is because the outer layer dries out and microwaves work chiefly by exciting water molecules in food so you have to pull it out fold it over on itself bring the firmer exterior into the looser interior to achieve thermal equilibrium once it equilibrates and it's a nice workable consistency i will fold in the food coloring for my method it must be the gel style food coloring the thin liquidy food colorings would just spill out onto the floor i'm stretching and twisting the candy all over again to get that color worked through once it gets too hard i'll just microwave it again two or three seconds at a time flip nuke again two or three seconds if you overheat it in the microwave it'll melt onto the floor you'll never get it off but you'll burn yourself trying heat it a few seconds at a time work the color through and this is why i'm wearing the gloves i can just pull them off when i'm done and now i can handle my white lump without color polluting it i'm trying to keep that lump warm too so i'll give that a little bit more time in the microwave as i get my green lump back to a workable temperature don't forget to flip it constantly or it will melt onto the microwave floor i'm going to try to do a citrus slice design today so i'm working this into a green triangular log this will be the sections of the lime slice for the membrane surrounding the sections i'm going to cut off a small chunk of white and get that back to a workable temperature the pros use an actual white food coloring like titanium oxide i've never seen that for sale at the grocery store this is white enough and i'll wrap it around two sides of my triangle heat that back up two or three seconds per side and i'll snip it into six sections i obviously could have gotten this hotter but you want to be conservative if you melt the interior of the candy that will collapse all the air bubbles that we worked in there and the candy will be too hard to crunch there i think that should look kind of like a lime slice once cut right maybe heat that up again roll it out into a log if you want an outer coating to wrap around the whole design you need to leave yourself at least a third of your candy mask for that purpose this i'm going to heat up again fold to equilibrate the temperature and then work in some yellow food coloring to go with my lemon lime flavoring stretch pull twist etc and now i can work this into a sheet big enough to wrap around my lime log heat that up again a few seconds at a time to the point where i can stretch this out again the pros do this on their giant heat tables and they have assistance to help them roll it out i'm just doing it myself one small section at a time using a combination of stretching and rolling i am still having major problems with warping the image at this stage so please do not take my advice as expert maybe you really do need a second pair of hands for this but anyway you're gonna have some waste at the tips of your logs even the pros have that problem just get whatever you can roll it as thin as possible the thinner the logs are the cleaner they cut and i think the sink is the perfect place to cut them at home just put some kind of bin down there to catch the candy and up here you have a precipice over which you can suspend your little candy canes and guillotine them i obviously have not mastered the touch of this yet either though again i think the main problem is that i did not roll these quite thin enough and my design is a complete disaster inside it's pure mush i have done much better on earlier batches all kinds of shards are gonna fly everywhere as you're cutting but because i'm doing this in the sink it doesn't matter similarly when it's time to clean this pot just fill up the sink with water and leave it overnight the sugar will dissolve all by itself you just rinse it off in the morning so yeah that batch was kind of a disaster design wise i did much better on previous attempts but that's my method see what you can do with it does it work as well as the big heating and cooling tables that the pros use absolutely not and if all you want is candy just buy it on the internet i have a link to my favorite shop in the description but if what you want is the fun experience of manipulating sugar lava yourself at home then have at it again be very careful proceed at your own risk

***RECIPE, MAKES...",29:02.6, a fluffy thick crust pizza with a dry crispy bottom not soggy or spongy that was my goal with this recipe that is obviously inspired by sicilian or detroit style pizza but i'm not limiting myself to those styles it takes absolutely no special equipment just a cake pan and a normal oven and check how easy this dough is one cup of warm water in a mixing bowl 237 mils a teaspoon of sugar goes in and then a teaspoon of dry yeast about half a packet lately i've been using these premium yeast packets i've seen at the stores that contain some of the dough enhancers commonly used in commercial bakeries this one has xanthan gum which should theoretically make this crust especially light and fluffy but normal yeast is fine and you don't have to bloom it for 10 minutes in the sugar water i just do that to make sure my yeast are still alive plus i like watching it happen now because this pizza is gonna have a lot of bread proportional to the other layers i want the bread to taste especially good to that end i'm adding two or three tablespoons of cornmeal inside a thick crust cornmeal gives this awesome flavor and satisfying texture without it i think this crust is a little bland and insubstantial and if you have a package of whole wheat flour already open i think you might as well throw in two or three tablespoons of that it just gives a little more depth of flavor and color to the crust but i don't think it's worth buying a bag of whole wheat flour just for that a little glug of olive oil in there and then i'm doing two teaspoons of this coarse salt maybe 10 grams that's more salt than i'd normally use for this much pizza dough but again there's going to be proportionally less salty cheese on this than on a thin crust pizza so the dough needs to be able to season itself now for bread flour all-purpose flour would be fine as much as i can easily stir in with a spoon which will probably end up being about a cup and a half 200 grams maybe no hand kneading just the wooden spoon i have found that if i restrict myself to the spoon i will end up mixing in just about the perfect amount of flour for a very wet no-knead dough which is what this is to get any more flour in there and push the hydration lower you would have to use your hand and actually start kneading as much flour as you can stir in is perfect it's all stuck to the spoon but that's just fine leave the spoon in there we'll need it later i'll cover this and throw it in the fridge for at least a day but two or three or four would be even better to bake the pizza i've got a 9 inch 23 centimeter square cake pan normal cheap thin metal glass or heavy enameled cast iron might not get hot fast enough in the oven for this recipe for my method i have to have a parchment paper sling to lift out the pizza and instead of trimming the corners so that it fits down in the pan i'ma just crumble it up thank you commenter jrk this may be the best tip i've gotten ever crumple up the paper and all of a sudden it's way more pliable it'll fit right down in the corners a little olive oil goes on the paper any kind is fine but consider this fine oil from the sponsor of this video brightland let me thank them this is a beautiful extra virgin oil from a family-run heirloom olive farm in california most oils i've seen at the store are blends from lots of different global sources and there's nothing inherently wrong with that but it's hard to know exactly what you're getting and there's reason to believe much oil on the market isn't quite what it claims to be this one from brightland is called awake it has those greener pleasantly bitter notes that indicate high antioxidant levels indeed there's the polyphenol count right there on the website can't wait to try alive which is their fruitier oil they also have infused oils like this garlic oil crazy delicious and there's raw unfiltered honey champagne vinegar all from exactly where they say it's from in california grown and processed to very rigorous standards that you can taste try brightland now get 10 off when you click my link in the description and you order the luminous capsule a great starter pack of brightland products yes that shiny pore spout is included 10 off with my link in the description thank you brightland here's my no knead dough it's been rising slowly in the fridge for two days which gives it a great flavor the gluten proteins have autolyzed which means that all we have to do is basically fold this over on itself a few times and it will be very well kneaded it's super wet and sticky which is why i left the spoon right in there just mash it around a little with the spoon now i'll take my hand and rub that oil around inside the parchment lined pan this is gonna flavor and crisp the bottom of the pizza give it that slightly fried taste that i really want in a pan pizza now while my hands are still oily i'll reach in and grab that sticky dough and i'll give it a little gravity stretch just pinch the edge and let it fall away naturally we don't have to get this super thin but it helps to get it a little stretched out before it goes into the pan once there i'll grab the corners and try to stretch it out a little more it's going to expand and fill the pan as it proofs but you'll get a more even thickness if you start with something close to a full square i'll grab that same piece of plastic cover that up again and throw that dough somewhere to proof and puff up for at least an hour or two if you need to go to work or something you could throw this back in the fridge instead and let it proof slowly for another day or two that'd probably get you even better flavor once it's proofed the gluten will be more relaxed and you could give a final stretching to get it into the corners if they're not quite there yet also to make sure that it's not too thick in the center i'm pulling dough from the center if it's thick in the middle it's going to be undercooked in there i've had lots of bad sicilian pizza that's doughy toward the center when you're about ready to bake turn the oven on its highest normal setting no convection fan no broiler just normal heat position a rack all the way down at the bottom do yourself a favor and move the other racks up and away as high as possible so that doesn't happen to you when you reach in here later in most ovens in my part of the world the basic normal heat setting works chiefly via the bottom heating element i want to use that to blast the bottom of the pan with as much heat as possible that's why the rack is down there while it comes up to temperature i can stir up my sauce which is this brand of canned crushed tomatoes with some olive oil and whatever seasonings i'm feeling that day i basically never cook pizza sauce all canned goods are slightly cooked anyway canning takes heat and i would especially discourage using any heavily cooked sauce on this pizza a thick pizza is going to take longer to bake and thus the sauce is gonna lose more of that bright freshness that i think is characteristic of pizza sauce i'm actually gonna boost this with a little splash of that vinegar just to compensate for the dulling i'm gonna get with the longer bake use whatever mozzarella you like my favorite for pizza remains this brand of string cheese four sticks four ounces should be perfect for a pizza this size 113 grams my oven has reached its max temp which is 550 fahrenheit 190 c time to dress the pizza gently so that i don't deflate it i'm going edge to edge on my sauce and cheese detroit style you could leave a bare rim if you wanted more sicilian style either way just go easy with your sauce or else this pizza will be a wet gooey mess i like a little fake shaky parmesan under my mozzarella layer mats on top of that and again edge to edge that's just what i'm doing obviously you could do whatever additional toppings you want i'm just demonstrating the basic today in this goes on that bottom rack wait until you see how tall this puffs up we get lots of steam lots of oven spring from using such a wet dough and you can bake it all the way to completion right there i'm gonna pull it out just before it's done that was nine minutes in my oven i'll let it cool and solidify for just a few minutes and then lift it out with the paper sling peel the paper off the bottom this is much easier to do on a relatively small pizza if you need to feed more people i would suggest baking two small ones side by side rather than using a much bigger pan a big pizza would be too floppy to handle on that goes to a cooling rack and from the cooling rack i will just slide the pizza right back into the oven right on that lower oven rack i'm finishing my bake this way for two reasons one it allows me to actually see the bottom of the pizza this way i know when it's perfectly golden and not under baked or burned if it's down in the pan you just kind of have to guess when it's done the other reason is this final blast of dry heat gets you an incredibly crispy bottom that you would never get down in a pan there's just nowhere for the moisture to escape down in the pan that second phase lasted four minutes for me that's perfect i'll pull it back out to my cooling rack let it steam out for a couple of minutes and then we can cut that baby up and enjoy that tastes like a school lunch pizza that grew up and went to a fancy college it's my new favorite

***RECIPE, MAKES ONE BIG PORTION, MULTIPLY AS...",29:02.6, if you're intimidated by shellfish mussels are the perfect entry-level bivalve they were for me mussels are generally cooked unlike oysters they're sweet and generally free of any sand or other internal grossness unlike clams it's possible to make good food with frozen mussels but if you can get them fresh and live on ice that's the real deal you got to leave the bag open or they'll suffocate they're alive these are from prince edward island in canada pei mussels are famous because they're abundantly farmed they're pretty much always very good and you can get them all over the world via the miracle of modern shipping i bought these in my normal grocery store here in tennessee and the whole bag was just seven bucks they hardly required any cleaning i'm looking for beards and finally there's one those are the filaments with which the mussel anchored itself to the dangling rope on which it was farmed it's gross you just pull it out other than that i found one tiny little bit of beard on this one and that was it now i'll wash these to me the best thing about a bowl of mussels is the exquisite broth that they generate so it would be sad if that broth was polluted with sand or little shards of shell on the surface of these just wash them off in a strainer this is a two pound bag of mussels just under a kilo remember that most of the weight is shell so i'd say you want one pound per person if this is the only thing you're eating for dinner that's a generous full meal for two right there and really all we need with it are a few flavorings i'ma want a whole head of garlic in this go big or go home i'll chop that up pretty finely mussels cook in a flash so anything you put in with them has to be able to cook really fast as well hence shallots the classic muscle allium i like to cut those into very thin long strips that way you can kind of slurp them if you mince them they basically just disappear when cooked for a fresh herb my favorite with mussels is fennel fronds the bulb itself i'll use in something else that takes way too long to cook with mussels so many other herbs could work really anything you got tarragon would be awesome plain old parsley and that's it that's all the prep this meal takes it's almost as quick and easy as popping open a bag of ramen from the sponsor of this video eemi let me tell you about them real quick eemi is cool stuff instant ramen that isn't terrible for you check the ingredients the noodles are chiefly made of pumpkin seed protein they're still bound with gluten from grains so they've got terrific chew but check this pack 21 grams of protein just five net carbs moderate sodium tons of fiber and note that beef is in quote marks eemi has no animal products in it the soup base gets its delicious meaty flavor from yeast extract which is my new favorite thing you may have seen my recent video about it you don't have to be a vegan to love yeast extract i'm not it's awesome there's airsoft shrimp and chicken flavors too order yourself a variety box like mine here hit my link in the description and use code rogucia at checkout for five dollars off your order eemieets.com regucia use code ragusia for five dollars off a variety pack today you can make them in the microwave too but that was just seven minutes on the stovetop about the same time it'll take to actually cook these mussels i had a big pot heating over medium low while i chopped up my veg and in goes at least a tablespoon of butter per full dinner portion of mussels you could use olive oil instead i'm making an effort to not brown this butter or these shallots and garlic that i'm cooking in it today i want bright fresh sweet flavors not toasty brown ones just shake that around you really don't even need a utensil to make mussels in goes maybe a cup of white wine per full dinner portion so like two cups there this is not just ragucia being ragucia white wine is one of the most common bases for muscle broth it's incredible if you don't do wine i'd suggest water or seafood stock with a big splash of white balsamic vinegar to taste at the end if i had a fresh red chili i would have minced that up fine and put it in with the other veg but dried chili flakes are just fine too grind in some black pepper no salt yet because the mussels are salty they came from the ocean it's certainly not necessary but lemon zest is lovely in muscle broth it really freshens things up while everything in there softens i can quickly cut this lemon into wedges i might squeeze one of those in the pot but the others are for the table all right veg has been cooking for just 90 seconds that's all the head start it needs swirl that around we could cook our own shoes in this broth right now and they would taste good i like a little olive oil with the butter but i'm adding it toward the end to preserve its fruity flavors some people use a big splash of cream instead of oil or butter that's very nice too and it's time for the mussels when they hit the heat you may hear tiny squealing sounds the mussels are not screaming they do not have brains it's just steam squeezing out of their shells cover up the pot to trap the steam and then i plan to check on them in about two minutes we're looking to see them all opening up that's how you know they're cooked the denaturing of the proteins pulls the shell open how do you know if you're overcooking them if you see the meats inside starting to shrink a lot then they get rubbery you want to pull them out when they're still really big and plump i cooked these five minutes total you could just dump them out but i like to lift them out a few at a time with a slotted spoon for three reasons one if you drop them with too much force the shells will shatter or chip your plate two this gives you an opportunity to inspect a few muscles at a time people say that you should discard the ones that don't open during cooking supposedly if they don't open that means they were dead before you cooked them and may therefore be spoiled that's not totally true you can pry those open and if they look and smell good on the inside they're probably just fine third reason i like to lift these out of the broth is now it's really easy for me to taste the broth and make last minute adjustments yeah i think that just needs a tiny pinch more salt and i think i do want one wedge of lemon squeezed i'll keep the others on the side last thing is the fennel or whatever herb you're using add it at the last second to keep it green and then you just shower that angel juice over the mussels and let it collect at the bottom of the bowl how do you actually eat these some people pick out the meats with a teeny fork to me this is the far superior method grab a mussel and pull off the top shell the one that the meat is not connected to discard that on what my mom always calls the dead soldier plate that's kind of messed up i now realize then dip the meaty shell into the broth get it all filled up the adductor muscle holding the meat to the shell is cooked and very weak all you have to do is slurp gently and out it comes with all that broth you collected yes i appear to have a piece of garlic in my beard that's a thing that happened and i have to make my piece with it also very popular is dipping some crusty bread into the broth when i was a kid i was too grossed out to eat the mussels but i ate the sop and that was my gateway drug into bivalves among the most sustainable seafood you can eat and a mussel with garlicky white wine broth is easily one of my top five favorite bites of food in existence plus it's a perfect weeknight meal literally 15 minutes start to finish truly one of the best things on this planet imho

***RECIPE, FEEDS 8-10***...",29:02.6, hard to imagine a more comforting and affordable cold weather feast than a big pot of italian wedding soup this is an italian-american classic kind of mistranslated from the actual italian ministra maritata which means married soup not wedding soup it refers to the marriage of meat and greens or so they say in italy in a red checkered tablecloth italian-american joint it's generally going to be in a chicken broth often made with chicken meatballs or some kind of white meat in the meatballs all of this came to mind when i went to the store the other day and they had chicken leg quarters on crazy sale i've got almost five pounds of meat and bone here for less than five us dollars a little over two kilos from nice free-range chickens too i'm sure it's old meat but what do i care i'm going to pulverize it legs separated from the thigh there and then i'm just going to do the quickest sloppiest job of deboning the thigh just cut out the thigh bone however you want and then i'll pull the skin off the leg is going to be harder but again i don't have to be super thorough so i'm just lopping off whatever chunks of meat i can easily get if you come across those ropey tendons you might try to keep those out they don't grind up very well into meatballs but they're very soft on a chicken so it doesn't really matter it would matter with a turkey bone and skin goes into my stockpot meat goes into a bowl and repeat i think chicken meatballs made with breast meat are terrible dark meat is going to be way better much closer to something like beef the dark meat is also cheaper in the states and again i don't care if i'm doing such a thorough job of getting it off anything that doesn't end up in the meatballs is going to be dynamite for the stock skin especially filled with collagen certainly you can make this recipe with some store-bought stock and a couple of pounds of whatever ground meat they have at the store i just think it's fun that for five bucks worth of meat we're going to have about the finest chicken soup achievable on this planet and you don't have to have an actual stockpot for this just any big heat safe thing that holds water done i've got some old vegetables left over in the fridge an onion a few carrots a couple stalks of celery whatever you got is fine and you could make the stock on the stovetop but i'm doing the oven today under the grill broiler i just want to rapidly produce some brown flavoring and the red hot top element will do that very quickly a little too quickly there it doesn't really matter for broth if that's a little bit burned the burn flavor will be diluted give that a stir and back under the heat for a few minutes you could skip the browning entirely and make what they call a white chicken stock that's nice too but i want something more robust today again you could totally do this on the stovetop just fry the stuff around for a few minutes on the stovetop until you got some brown that's good enough for me now goes water filtered water from my fridge because bad tap water makes stock that tastes like dishwater cover everything all the way up and again you could just simmer that on the stove but i'm litting that up and putting it in the oven at just 200 degrees fahrenheit 95 c until tomorrow overnight or up to 24 hours if you're in a hurry do it at twice those numbers for just a couple hours it'll still be nice almost as nice as this airstream interstate 24x that you could win from the sponsor of this video omaze is a company that does prize giveaways

next day i did not have to check on that once it just did its thing in a very low oven imma fish out all those solids to discard and chicken stock does not get any better than that you could skim the fat off but honestly there isn't much fat and i want chicken fat in my chicken soup it's delicious i honestly don't think any further straining or filtering is necessary whatever little bits are floating around in there are totally edible and this is going to be a chunky soup however i have always wanted to try the soup clarifying trick where you grab a couple of egg whites i'll save the yolks for my meatballs you beat in some cold water just to loosen them so they'll integrate more smoothly into the warm stock stir stir stir and bring the pot back up to a simmer on the stove basically all of the impurities get caught in this coagulating raft of egg white as an added bonus it pushes all the fat on top over onto one side where you could very easily skim it off if you wanted to skim it off i want to eat it so i'm not going to skim it after about 10 minutes i will kill the heat grab a slotted spoon and skim off this yucky raft check that out that is a sheet of gelatin we dissolved out of the chicken parts that's going back in and you could of course skip the skimming and just pass this through a sieve usually you line the sieve with cheese cloth the best i had was a coffee filter which seems to be too fine it's not letting the good stuff through oh well i'll just pass that through the sieve and check it that is pretty darn clear which is fun but none of that was necessary it does not matter how jewel clear that is it's going to be cloudy again after we cook meatballs in it here's everything we cut off the bones you can legit mince meat by just hacking at it with a knife for a while i've done that many times it's a perfectly manageable amount of work if you're not working at a commercial scale still i'd rather break out my food processor this will probably take two batches and no a spinning blade does not produce ground meat but it's basically the same texture if you don't over blitz it it should not be a smooth paste it should still be a little chunky that's perfect next batch in just pulse it until it's almost a paste but not quite all right in goes my egg yolks for binding mother and child reunion a giant pile of grated pecorino or parmesan cheese pretty standard for any italian-american meatball such as myself bad news i'm out of cheese good news i now have a cheese rind which is great for soup you'll see breadcrumbs whatever kind you got but i increasingly think panko is best for everything if i'm judging by dry volume which i am i generally go for like a quarter breadcrumbs in my meatball mix grind in a ton of pepper there's a lot of meat to season here maybe a little red pepper flakes just for fun some garlic powder or fresh garlic if you've got it and i think i'd rather have my dried herbs in my meatballs as opposed to floating around in the broth so lots of dried thyme oregano sage is super nice with chicken and maybe a little too much sage is super strong and i'm gonna guess like two big pinches of salt for this much stuff if i have it i do like to snip some fresh parsley or basil or something into meatball mix it looks pretty and it functions like structural mesh reinforcing the delicate ball i really should have a much bigger bowl for this but i'm committed now get back in there you once i've got this all mixed up i will sacrifice a little bit of it to the microwave so that i can do a quick taste for seasoning actually not that bad and the salt is just right i do think we'll need some more fat for moistening since chicken is so lean compared to ground beef or sausage olive oil is great but if you skimmed off that chicken fat you could mix it right back in right there roll these into meatballs you could either go for meatballs so small you can eat them with a soup spoon or you could go from meatballs large enough they'll be easy to grab and break up with a soup spoon i was going for the former and i ended up with the latter because i always do real quick i'll prep my first phase vegetables an onion any onion for chunks and a soup i like to french the onions or do little wedges those look pretty floating around and they're slurpable some carrots with thick boys like these i like to slice them into quarters that should be a manageable shape and size for a soup spoon my broth is simmering and ready though i will augment it with like half a bottle of white wine i'm sorry but this just makes the soup so much better so much brighter and sweeter i have my doubts about bay leaves but you definitely do actually taste them in chicken soup the flavor here is subtle enough that the bay leaves shine through and the best italian soup trick ever is to throw in a cheese rind that you would otherwise just throw away tons of flavor in there and i'll give this a couple of pinches of salt to get it going but we can always add more to taste later veg goes in you could do celery you could do all kinds of things but right now we're only doing the things that can handle long cooking the greens will wait and the meatballs you could just drop in too let them poach in the broth lots of people do wedding soup just like this couldn't be easier i'll do a few of those so you can see how they come out poached for more robust flavor yeah you'll want to brown them first i highly recommend a non-stick pan chicken meatballs especially are very delicate and likely to break when you try to push them off a sticky pan you don't have to get them cooked all the way through just get some flavor on their crusts into the broth they go next batch in and another way of doing this is just shake the pan the unbrowned sides are heavier so they roll to the bottom which is where you want them not as precise as nudging them around with a spoon but good enough everybody in the pool also time for some little pasta orzo couscous whatever i imagine this originated as a way of using whatever crumbled up little bits of pasta you have left over just don't put in too much it's going to expand like whoa i only put in half that 500 gram package and that was too much and now you just simmer this until the veg is soft and the meatballs are cooked through i maybe gave it like half an hour but that's super flexible plenty of time to prep the greens any dark leafy greens you like this is kale but i highly recommend looking for a curly variety the curls are better at holding on to broth as you spoon the pieces into your mouth the greens come out kind of juicy and i'm just cutting out the extremely tough and fibrous center stem you could cut that up and put it in the soup but put it in with the carrots and everything so it has way more time to soften this is about a pound half a kilo of kale which might seem like a lot but honestly i wish i'd bought twice as much it wilts down a ton oh here let me show you something that looks gross to normal people but people who cook know better check out the gelatin solidifying on top of my soup that's how you know you made good stock the soup could hold as is for hours but i like to put in my greens like 10 minutes before i plan to eat they're fine if you overcook them but i think they're better if you don't see check how much those wilted down oh time to start fishing out the bay leaves once you find them they're just for flavoring the broth you'll choke if you try to eat one hole real quick i'll peel and chop some garlic my other favorite italian soup trick is to stir in fresh garlic right before you eat so it's just barely cooked in the hot soup let's give that broth one last taste honestly i think i nailed that which is bad because i try to be conservative with my salt you can always stir in a little bit more at the end when you can taste it and if you didn't use the white wine i highly recommend stirring in a little bit of lemon juice or vinegar here at the end just to taste i have had way too many italian wedding soups that tasted totally flat almost everything benefits from some acidity if your greens are a little drab by the time you actually eat i say just drop in some fresh parsley or some basil directly into the bowl that'll cheer things up and man the eponymous marriage of meat and dark greens is as delicious as it is nutritious here's one of the meatballs we just poached in the soup instead of browning at first it's much softer as you cut through it and it has a softer taste very nice seems like it'd be very comforting if you're sick and we've got more than enough here to feed an army or to freeze for a rainy day which is what i'ma do wedding soup on a literal rainy day looking forward to that

One of my favorite parts of Christmas is coming
downstairs in the morning and finding gingerbread — not a cookie but a loaf of gingerbread.
You lop off a big, thick slice and there's your totally indefensible Christmas breakfast
— dense and rich and spicy. I have tried to improve upon the Joy of Cooking recipe
I grew up eating and I have found there really isn't much room for improvement. I do think
I've streamlined the process a little bit. Get the oven heating to 350ºF/180ºC. This
is 9x5 inch loaf pan — pretty standard size, but this recipe could work in nearly any mid-size
cake pan. And I'm a big fan of parchment slings. It
just makes it way easier to get the thing out after it's done. I'll cut some deep wedges
out of the corners here and that should make it fit well enough, once there's batter weighing
it down. Speaking of which, here's a microwave-safe
measuring jug. I'll start with 1 cup of milk or water — not much difference. 237 mL.
Molasses — this is probably the dominant ingredient, other than the ginger. Half a
cup, 118 mL. Nah, I do not think you can use brown sugar instead. Even dark brown sugar
has shockingly little molasses in it — one of many reasons why I don't buy brown sugar. Summon forth the upside-down — oh, false
alarm, it's just a normal bottle. Half a cup of honey. You could replace this with more
molasses if you want a really dark bread. Other syrups, like golden syrup would probably
do fine. I tried maple syrup but it just did not bring the same gooey, puddingy texture
in the final loaf. Honey is great for that, and it's easily measured by displacement in
this jug. 118 mL of honey. Once stick, 113g of butter. Also half a cup.
You could measure that by displacement too if your butter doesn't come in standard sticks.
Cutting it up in chunks will help it melt faster here in the microwave. This is good, because I want my whole batter
to be warm. Joy of Cooking accomplishes this by simply pouring a cup of hot water into
the batter toward the end. If a batter like this is warm when it goes in the oven, it
fluffs up more — I would guess because its water converts to steam earlier in the bake
while the surface is still pliable enough that it won't restrict growth. I did a side-by-side
test to make sure warm batter is worth it, and in a super-heavy batter like this, wow,
it really makes a difference. The cold batter version came out like a brick. But I don't want this to be so hot that it
scrambles the egg, so I will pull it right before the butter is all the way melted. Just
a couple minutes. Once I start stirring it and spreading around the heat, that butter
should finish melting, especially as I let it sit for a minute and measure out dry ingredients.
Two and a half cups of all-purpose flour, 300g. That's a little too much, there. Yoink. A heaped half-teaspoon of this kosher salt
is enough for me, though I'd do a whole teaspoon flat if I was using unsalted butter. Time for the best part: the spices. Joy of
Cooking calls for a tablespoon of cinnamon. I'ma want at least twice that. If it was fresh
ground, maybe a single tablespoon would do enough, but come on. And they call for two
teaspoons of ground dried ginger. Yeah, I'ma need at least twice that, too. You put in
enough and you can feel that chemesthetic sensation of heat from the gingerol on your
tongue. It warms you up at Christmas. And speaking of pungency, a little black pepper
is very nice, and traditional in lots of historic recipes. Just tighten the mill so that you
get a really fine grind. I think a big chunk of black pepper would be unpleasant in cake.
You could do some cardamom, some coriander seed — all traditional, because colonialism. Baking soda — not baking powder. Sodium
bicarb here is just a base, no acid. There's enough acid in the molasses and the ginger
and such to neutralize a teaspoon and a half of this and get some gas. That's it for the dry. Over here with the
wet, the butter is melted, I'll put in half a cup of plain white sugar, 100g. That should
also provide a bit of anti-scramble insurance if the mixture is still a little too hot for
an egg. Just one egg, beat it in briskly until smooth. A big whisk makes this go way easier. I'll
whisk the dry stuff for a second, mostly just to break up any big chunks of flour that I
would have sifted out if I'd followed the old Joy of Cooking recipe down to the letter.
Now to whisk in all the wet stuff. Get it nice and smooth but don't go crazy. The finished
product can end up a little chewy if you whisk this too much. Get it just smooth. Pour directly into the loaf pan. It really
doesn't matter if a little bit escapes the parchment sling. The sling will still make
it easy to lift out. If you don't have parchment, yeah, you could just grease the sides of the
pan. But given how long this has to bake, oil tends to give me a slight burned taste
on the sides of the loaf. It probably wouldn't be as big a deal if you baked this in a shallow
cake pan, because that would take half as long. The deep loaf pan is gonna take at least
an hour in my oven. You could do the ol' toothpick test, but with
this you really can just poke it. It if feels squishy inside, it's not done. When it feels
bouncy inside, that's done. And I find it always looks a little raw on the surface when
it's done. If it doesn't have that surface rawness, it's overcooked and dry on the inside. Now I can just lift that out so it doesn't
get soggy inside the hot pan. I'll let that cool all the way down before I slice it. You
can see it's got a little bit of wubba-wubba when it's hot. That's a good sign it's not
over-baked inside. Now it's cool, it's firm, I can peel the paper
off. And I'm spanking on some powdered sugar purely for the thumbnail. I think this needs
no adornment. When the surface is still a little crispy from the oven you can get a
clean slice by sawing with chef's knife just until it kinda catches and bites through the
surface. Then you can press through without anything breaking. It's easier to slice this cleanly when it's
a day or two old, which is how I prefer it anyway. Those hygroscopic syrups in there
grab water out of the air and this gets even more dense and moist and just a little spongy.

each of these very basic delights if you know nothing about how to cook an egg in a pan i have endeavored to make a video for you and this is it first thing you'll need is a pan and the main reason i keep one non-stick pan around is for eggs yes people had fried eggs prior to the invention of teflon in 1938 but it's just way harder to do in other kinds of pans save that for the 201 class in a good non-stick pan you could use no fat at all but i think most people use some anyway because it makes the egg taste better and eggs can still stick in here without some grease i think butter tastes better than oil plus butter gives you lots of sensory clues about how hot your pan is if the butter just kind of melts and looks smooth like that your pan is not hot enough yet unless you're going for a very soft pure white egg if it foams gently that's a great starting temperature for eggs if the butter browns your pan is pretty hot for eggs which is good for some things and not for others i think a gentle foaming is a good place to start and on my stove that's just south of medium but every stove is different in my experience you can cook eggs straight out of the refrigerator or you can cook them at room temperature it really doesn't make much of a difference first step is to crack it which takes some practice if you hit it too hard well that happens obviously if you don't hit it hard enough you have to really dig in with your thumbs to break it the rest of the way and when you do that you risk sending a shard up inside the egg that breaks the yolk the yolk is like a water balloon in there and just because it didn't happen that time doesn't mean it can't happen i think that same risk is why it's bad to crack on the side of a bowl or some such you're just sending spiky bits of shell up inside the egg where they could stab the yolk a bowl also just tends to make lots of little shards that are hard to fish out better to crack on a flat surface and in she goes you can see that this egg is not terribly fresh nor is it terribly old see how there's a little plateau of elevated white circling the yoke that's the white that was attached to the upward facing side of the yoke when it was inside the shell and it's still attached it's just slumping over the sides like long hair over your head if this egg was really old the white would have broken down to the point where you would not see that plateau the white would be super liquid and sitting really flat and this is a little liquid you can see where it's running out in little messy offshoots a really fresh egg doesn't do that the white is viscous enough that it holds a really tidy shape in the pan it doesn't spill out every which way you can see that the bottom layer of white is very well cooked at this point it's got a slightly golden edge around it it's firm enough that i can slide this egg around and it holds together that inner ring of white is still kind of gooey not quite set yet and that yolk is still cold one of the great things about cooking eggs is you can just touch them to assess them that yolk is not just raw it's literally still cold from the refrigerator if you cook a sunny side up egg like this you're going to get a white that is so firm you can't really cut it with a fork and or you're going to get a totally raw yolk on top some people like that i kind of like that but say you want it a little more evenly cooked through butter in a nice gentle foam crack in the egg oh by the way this is when a lot of people would sprinkle on a tiny pinch of salt when that top is still liquid enough to dissolve the grains a little bit that way you get more even seasoning on top if you're into that i usually just salt my eggs at the table anyway to get the egg to cook evenly now you slap on your lid your lid okay so i don't have a lid for this pan and if i really like sunny side up eggs i would buy a lid for this pan because a tight-fitting lid is much better at this than a piece of foil but the foil will do it just traps some steam in there that cooks the top of the egg and you can tell because after a few minutes the yolk gets kind of cloudy if i touch it it's warm but still very soft and runny which is how i almost always want it but if you want it firmer just keep cooking it until you can feel that it's firmer time to slide that baby out in most cases i think it's easier to slide the egg right out of the pan onto the plate it can be tricky to get a spatula up under there as you will soon see so now we've got a somewhat more evenly cooked egg though the bottom layer is still so heavily cooked that it's a little brown and it's hard to cut with just a fork i like that but lots of people don't if you want an egg that's really soft and creamy and pure white on the bottom you need really low heat the butter is hardly foaming at all that means the pan isn't even hot enough to evaporate the water out of the butter in the egg goes and the bottom layer of white is setting but it's not fluttering around there's no steam making it bubble and dance around the edges that's what we want for these purposes no fluttering cover so the top will steam and this is going to take a while with such low heat that was about 8 minutes but the result is a really soft custardy white that you can easily cut with a fork the yolk is warm but still very runny very nice you could go in the exact opposite direction and do a crispy egg i think oil is better for this the milk solids and butter would likely burn at the temperatures we're going to use i'm on medium heat now but as soon as i crack that in i can see i need to go higher for a crispy egg i want to see that skirt of white fluttering in the breeze lots of steam making the white bubble and dance around and stand back because steam bubbles are going to explode and this is going to start spitting hot oil at you there's a reason i've got the camera up on a tripod for this one instead of sitting down on the counter i love a crispy egg but they are legit dangerous to make don't let any kids around the stove when this is happening once the egg's about done you can turn the heat down and safely inspect close up i can see the yolk is looking a little cloudy even though i never covered it that's just because the heat in the pan was way higher it reached up to the yolk if anything that yolk is overdone to my taste to assess the bottom you just lift it up it's so firm and crispy it's like a potato chip of egg since there's excess oil in the pan i will lift this out with a spatula so i can leave that grease behind you know early in my youtube career a dude in the comments scolded me for getting a little golden brown on my eggs he tried to argue that browning on eggs is objectively bad it's not something that anyone with good taste would ever want and i was like dude tell that to asia that is super tasty but here's probably my favorite way to do an egg with a nice bright solid yolk on top a basted egg put a little more oil in the pan than you would normally use yeah you can do this with butter but i like to do it with extra virgin olive oil or one time i did with chicken fat which was awesome cook the egg as aggressively as you want as you can see i've got no fluttering around the edges i'm going for a soft white bottom and then instead of covering the pan to steam the top you just spoon hot oil over the top it helps if you tilt the pan to make the oil pool up at one side one time i did this on the internet and a dude in the comments was like you clearly have no idea what you're doing you're using a metal utensil on a non-stick surface dude it's not like i'm grinding a knife edge into the pan it's just the round belly of a spoon that's not gonna hurt anything plus this isn't just any nonstick pan it's from the sponsor of this video mizin let me thank them for a sec all non-stick pans lose their coating over time but miesen's pan has three distinct layers of non-stick all bonded to a durable layer of plasma primer underneath they say this pan will last two and a half times longer than a traditional non-stick and i believe it just like all mies and pans you can immediately tell how heavy and solid this is i don't understand how they sell you so much metal for so little money but there it is the comfy rubber handle slides off so you can use this in the oven when beginners ask me what pans to buy i say misen even when i'm not being paid to say so because i've become a true believer other pans in this price range feel like they're made out of aluminum foil as i've said you can cook eggs in carbon steel even stainless with some practice misen has tons of options on their site go there via my link in the description and use my code regucia you'll get 20 off your first order on this non-stick pan or anything 20 off with my link and code in the description just use my name ragusia thank you mizen so yeah with the basted egg you just have a lot more control you can see what you're doing you can spoon oil over particular areas of the egg that you want to cook more the yolk ends up much brighter not as cloudy as when you steam the top and as you can see the oil just rolls right off but you do have to lift the egg out of the oil which is surprisingly tricky on a gently cooked soft white egg i gotta just dive in eggs do not respect hesitancy same basting technique is gonna work at higher temperatures too i'm on medium heat now and you can see my white fluttering a bit spoon that hotter oil over the top and you get a nice bubbly fried effect all over if you're into that really good both of those basted eggs but to me there is one clearly superior way to cook a whole unbroken egg in a pan it is my favorite way of having eggs and it is eggs over easy gently foaming butter egg in the pan and first step is to cook the white until it's pretty solid it's been there two and a half minutes the bottom is set and that inner ring of white is just starting to set up that is my cue that this egg is just solid enough to flip without breaking it i slide it down to the edge of the pan so it's already up on its side i don't have to flip it much farther if you flip it too high the yoke will break on impact and there you can see i flipped it a little too low a little too gently but no harm done i'm not gonna lie that takes practice and i still screw it up all the time but eggs are cheap and all the mistakes are edible for a runny yolk it really only needs like 30 seconds on this side and you could just slide it directly onto the plate or you could flip it back around again some people think this top side is going to look nicer at this point the egg is solid enough to be flipped with a spatula if i'd used a spatula on the first flip i would have shredded that egg to ribbons that to me is the best way to have an egg though by the time i got my camera in position the yolk had overcooked a bit i'd call that over medium not over easy which is still good but with certain egg dishes you have to get it out of the pan the second that it's done or maybe even a few seconds before it's done as in the case of scrambled eggs crack a couple eggs in a bowl and people usually stir in a little salt one tiny pinch per egg is enough for me and then it's common to put in a little splash of milk or water when you beat this up the extra moisture just loosens everything up and makes it easier for the egg to expand and fluff up with steam in the pan either that or the extra water simply gives you more steam probably both scrambled eggs usually come out better with more fat in the pan and with the heat a little bit higher that's a not so gentle foam again i'm looking to create some steam that will give me a fluffy curd and i like to start scrambled eggs the way you would start an omelet stir constantly until it stops being stirrable until it just sets up on you the only difference is now you destroy the omelet just scrape the egg off the bottom then you get these big fluffy ribbons or sheets of curd they're still a little runny on the inside and if i want them to stay a little runny on the inside i have to get this out like 10 seconds ago it's already too late by the time i move my camera and reset my shot it's all over my curds are totally set with a little golden brown on them perfect for my wife but i like them runnier i assume the reason scrambled eggs are so time sensitive is they're getting intense heat from all sides unlike a sunny side up egg that's the same reason the over easy egg is more time sensitive heat from both sides please note by the way these are american style scrambled eggs french style scrambled eggs are more like a stirred custard we'll do those another day but just to give you frogs a thrill you can see me try to make a folded omelet i'm using a 10 inch pan and in a pan that big i need three eggs a minimum for an omelet with two eggs the omelet is so paper thin i always tear it same deal as before a little salt a little milk and it helps to really beat this very smooth beating it loosens up the protein structure so the eggs will flow much more readily into a solid thin sheet one time a dude in the comments castigated me for beating eggs with a fork instead of a whisk he said the fork is juvenile how do people like that function in the real world okay lots of butter for an omelette lots of butter even in a non-stick pan an omelette can still stick on you and i'm being sure to get butter up along the sides because egg is going to go up in there i'm doing an american style diner omelette so i've got my butter and aggressive foam a fancy french omelet you would cook at a much lower temperature i think stir stir stir wipe down the side and stir for as long as this mixture will remain liquid this helps it all cook rapidly and evenly the second it stops flowing into its own gaps i'll smush it all down into an even layer it's just plastic enough that i can do that though it won't be for long real quick now is when you can put in some fillings some fresh herbs are very nice i'm going to turn the heat off those eggs are done i'll grate on some lovely spanish cheese lauren bot i forget the name but man the spaniards know from cheese and i want to fold this before the top looks totally set it should still be a little gooey on top sometimes the bottom is solid enough that i can just grab one end but not today psy watch jacques papan if you want to see a professional do this i do suspect that one reason the traditional tri-fold shape developed is that it gives you not one but two chances to get it right there you go i'd be very happy to get that at a diner but the fancy french omelets that i've seen are not golden at all and they have a much smoother softer curd we'll try one of those another day and again this would have been perfect if i hadn't had to take 20 seconds to reset my shot it was a little gooey in the pan but it's pretty solid on the plate with eggs that get cooked from all sides you just gotta get them out before they are done to your liking but hey worst case scenario is you've got scrambled eggs and scrambled eggs are awesome plus you won't be juggling a camera while you're doing this it's gonna be way easier for you give eggs a shot they're great
Black and white cookies | NY-style dense cake with crispy icing,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8S5vkk2ZHV4/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLBoRVqpLpQg3y4lZ2UOelnoSQchpA,8S5vkk2ZHV4,"8 minutes, 32 seconds","Thanks to Magic Spoon for sponsoring this video!

If you’re watching...",29:02.6," The secret to black and white cookies is they
are not made from cookie dough. It's cake batter that you bake in dollops as if it were
cookies, and then the glaze is basically just Christmas cookie icing. You could use any
yellow cake batter recipe you like, but the classic New York-area black and whites I grew
up eating tend to be much closer to pound cake. Very heavy, very dense. In fact I'm starting with my pound cake recipe.
A cup of granulated sugar, 200g. A stick and a half of softened butter, 170g. I softened
that in the microwave on very low power for just a few seconds. And I will cream that
into the sugar until very fluffy. Oops, I forgot the other half a stick. I think it
helps to do this kind of thing in the narrowest bowl that will suffice. A narrow bowl allows
you to keep more of the mixture in contact with the beaters at any given time. It really takes a lot to get this as fluffy
as it needs to be, which is why I probably would not bother doing this without a power
tool of some kind. Gotta get it to where it kinda looks like mayonnaise. Something like
that. If it's not fluffy, it'll be kinda hard and crunchy once baked in cookie form, which
is not what I'm after. I want dense yet soft. To that end, I'll put in half a cup of sour
cream, 120g. You could use any soft fermented milk situation. I usually use buttermilk for
poundcake because it lightens it a bit. But for these cookies I don't want light. I want
heavy, yet soft. Sour cream is great for that, so is greek yogurt. And I've got the mixture looking mayonnaise-y
again, so time for eggs. Two eggs. Pretty standard for a poundcake of this scale. I'll
mix in my other wet ingredients with these. Lots of New York bakeries traditionally use
lemon juice or lemon extract here. I think that clashes with the chocolate icing, so
I'm doing a big splash of vanilla and then a little splash of almond extract, which you
could skip. Mix that up nice and smooth and fluffy, then
I can start beating in about two cups of all-purpose flour, 240g, a little at a time so that it
doesn't explode everywhere. Hey, did you know clouds of flour dust are highly combustible?
That's a thing. Look it up. A little more flour now, and I'll put in my
other dry ingredient. A quarter teaspoon of baking soda to neutralize the acidity of the
sour cream. I like acidity, of course, but that taste just isn't traditional here, to
me. And that could be enough leavening right there,
but to be safe I'm throwing in half a teaspoon of baking powder. You normally don't need
any chemical leavening in poundcake batter. The whipped-up butter does the trick. But
a cake can climb the walls of the pan as it bakes, which stabilizes the structure as it
puffs up. This batter will have nothing to climb, so I think some chemical leavening
helps keep the cookies from baking too flat. That's all mixed in and I'll do the last bit
of flour. You could put in even more flour — that'd probably get you taller cookies,
to a point. But you also gotta remember that black and whites tend to dry a bit over the
time it takes for the icing to set, and more flour means drier baked goods. That looks
good to me. I'll give it a taste, the raw eggs being a
minor health risk that I'm willing to take. You do you. Since I used salted butter, I
only want a tiny pinch more. If I'd used unsalted butter I'd probably start with a half a teaspoon
of the Morton kosher salt I use for most things. That's done. The first of two baking sheets,
parchment paper really helps when it comes to peeling these off later, especially if
you do big cookies. I'm scooping out like half a cup of batter for each cookie. The bakery I remember going to on Long Island
made black and white cookies the size of dinner plates, or at least that's how I recall them.
I was proportionally much smaller at the time. I'm spacing these really far apart, because
they're gonna spread a ton. Drat, it looks like I'm gonna get seven. I was shooting for
eight. One is the only odd-number allowed among baked goods! I would guess pro bakers pipe out this batter
to get perfect rounds. Unless I'm working at a commercial scale I usually think piping
bags take more effort than they're worth. What I can do instead is wet my hands with
water — that will allow me to shape these into something more round without the batter
sticking to me. I've seen people use the same water film trick to handle super-sticky pizza
doughs. It works real good. It the oven at like 350ºF/180ºC convection
bake. If you don't have a convection fan I'd go a little hotter. In my oven, I'm guessing
those will take about 20 minutes. In the meantime, I can sit down and beg forgiveness for all
the sugar I'm about to eat. Bless me, father, for it's been a couple weeks

Spoon. Alright, here we are after like 18 minutes.
Looking pretty good. You shouldn't expect them to brown all the way on top. I'll pat
this to feel if the inside is cooked. It's still a little squishy. I'll give that a few
more minutes. Here we are after maybe 22. They should still
look a little under-baked. If they're not, they're gonna be dry by the time we actually
eat them. Let those cool all the way down and solidify before peeling them off the paper,
which shouldn't be too hard. There, the bottoms are the tops — the flat side is the one
you ice. Speaking of which... You'll need a big pile of powdered sugar.
I would guess six cups — like 700g, at least. It may seem like a lot, but it's good to have
extra. You don't want to run out in the middle of the job. Corn syrup — you don't have
to use this, but just a little corn syrup will make the icing shinier and softer. It's
a different kind of sugar so it interferes in crystallization. I'm just eyeballing a
couple tablespoons. I want the icing pretty firm when it's dried, but not shattering into
shards when I bite through it. Now it's time to stir in just enough water
or milk to dissolve this into a glaze, and it'll take way less than you think. I mean,
what was that — a quarter cup, maybe? I'll stir that up and yep, that was a little too
much liquid. I want this very thick so I get a nice thick layer of glaze on top of the
cookie. A little more sugar to compensate. If there are lumps, I wouldn't bother getting
out a whisk. I'd just let this sit a few minutes and then stir it again. Everything should
dissolve. And you could put in a little bit of vanilla, but there's plenty in the cake,
and I want to keep the color bright. That looks perfect — very thick, but still spreadable. Again, I'm sure the bakeries would pipe this.
If you have something a little wider than a butter knife, that'd make this go a little
faster, but anything will do. My approach is to first drizzle the straight line down
the middle, and then flood the rest of the white half. Slap a lot of extra icing on.
If there's too little to spread you'll risk breaking up the surface of the cookie and
getting crumbs mixed into the icing. Any excess will just drip down off the side and we can
break it off later. The chocolate half will be much easier to
apply it you let the first half set up nice and firm, for maybe an hour. In the meantime,
we can convert the remaining icing into chocolate. I would guess three or four tablespoons of
cocoa powder, but again, it's the kind of thing you can just eyeball and then taste.
I think dutched cocoa is traditional, both for the flavor and for the darker color it
provides, but natural would be fine. You'll probably need a little extra liquid
to get it all dissolved or dispersed. Some people put in melted solid chocolate — very
dark chocolate, or even unsweetened chocolate. You can do that if you want a gooey texture
to contrast the smooth, crisp texture of the white icing. I just want the chocolate side
a little gooier, so I'll add a little more corn syrup to do that. That tastes good to me, but it's not as dark
in color as I want it. It's a black and white cookie, not a brown and white. So, I will
start stirring in a little blue food coloring. Blue plus brown pigment should equal black.
I don't want it literally black, but I do want it very dark brown. There we go. I'll just drizzle this down on the cookies
with a spoon at first. Now that the white icing is solid, it should form a solid flood
bank, keeping that chocolate from spilling over into the wrong side of the cookie. Again,
just drizzle on the straight line, flood the rest and then I'll switch to my knife to kinda
pull it the rest of the way down the side. Straight line drizzle, flood, pull. Straight
line drizzle, flood, pull. It's a dance craze! Now the hardest part — let that set overnight.
I really don't think they taste right until the next day. Sorry, honey. ""Can I eat one now?"" ""No."" ""Now?"" ""No!"" ""I want to eat one!"" So yeah, the next day you can just lift one
up and kinda snap off any excess icing, or if you want a little cleaner edge you can
go around with a butter knife down on the pan. We could have also let these drain on
wire racks, but that would have made a big mess. I think these are great — totally
tastes like what I grew up eating on Long Island when I visited by grandma. You can
see the density of the crumb there. The best part is the two-for-one tastes you
get — you can have bites that are all chocolate, all white, or different combinations of the
two. Textbook heterogeneity. A classic for a reason."
Fully deboned turkey | demi glacé made with the bones,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/peeRWHI7FpY/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLBJ8FWViR86NBHxN9HJiqJKnH4-1w,peeRWHI7FpY,"18 minutes, 7 seconds","Thanks to Fetch Rewards for sponsoring this video!

My guide to stuffing:...",29:02.6, i have been and remain an advocate of simple roast turkey with gravy but this is a more involved approach that i've been wanting to try for a while i fully de-boned this turkey before roasting it and i use the bones to make a turkey demi-glass which is delicious what i like about this method is all the hard work is done in advance on the day of your big holiday feast all you do is throw a pan in the oven and slicing up boneless meat could not be easier the sauce you just reheat you're done i'd suggest starting two days out from said feast though you could start the day before this is a big turkey 20 pounds nine kilos but you can do this with any size bird and i'll get some kitchen scissors and my boning knife but you could use any really sharp knife flip the bird around so that you're looking at its backbone there are only four places where the skeleton protrudes up through the meat the shoulder joints there and the hip joints down here other than those four points all the meat is just sitting on top of the bones so all you have to do is peel it off i've cut straight down along one side of the spine now i'll just let my knife follow the bones and you can feel them super easy just slowly peel the meat off of that central skeleton and i've hit my first joint the hip joint there lots of people have lots of ways of getting through the joints here's my crude but easy approach grab kitchen scissors get them around the joint grip down and then twist hard just kind of lever that joint around until you start to dislocate it when you open it up a bit you can get in with your scissors and start snipping away at the ligaments and other stuff connecting that femur to the pelvic girdle i'm through and that whole hip and leg quarter is now free up here i've hit the shoulder joint and i'll do the exact same thing get my scissors around the joint twist to lever it apart a bit and then i can snip or cut the ligaments attaching the humerus to the scapula both joints on this side are now cut so i am free and clear i can just keep peeling meat off of the ribs one little slice at a time following the bones with my knife we're cutting the breast meat off now and i'm gonna stop when i reach the very bottom which will be the sternum the breastbone that half of the bird is now free so i can keep using my dominant hand i'll simply rotate the bird to do the other side yes i'm doing this directly on my counter i'm gonna have to spray down this counter no matter what i do so i figure there's no point in trying to do this on a little cutting board everything is gonna spill out anyway again i'm just peeling the meat off the backbone until i hit a joint and i can't go any further there's the other hip joint i can feel it even though i can't see it i'll just get in with my scissors grab the joint and twist to dislocate it if you do not yet have basic knowledge of bird anatomy i would not recommend doing this break down a few whole chickens cooked and raw before you attempt anything ambitious as this i'm through the hip and now i can peel off the rest of the leg quarter real easy one more joint to go and honestly the wing or shoulder joint here is small enough even on a big turkey that you can dislocate it by hand this is how i normally do all the joints on a chicken just pop the joint and now that it's loose you can easily get your knife in there and cut through any tissue still holding the joint together start peeling that breast meat off of the ribs and the breast bone and now the british and french sides of the chunnel have converged just peel the meat off the sternum there maybe just break off the wishbone and the central skeleton or carcass is free i'll just put that over here with the neck and the giblets all great stuff for the gravy or demi-gloss there are a few bits of cartilage still hanging out around where the breastbone was i'll trim those out next challenge is to get the leg and thigh bones out first just cut straight down to the thigh bone and then peel some meat off the sides then i'll slip my knife in and under oops that's actually facing the wrong way get the knife facing out and then saw out toward where the hip was that end of the femur is now free same process on the knee and the shin bone there the tibia just cut straight down across the length of it and then start to peel meat off the sides until you can see what you're doing now i think i'll just grab the hip bone and start sawing underneath the knee peeling that off peeling the tibia off the meat underneath and then once i get down around the ankle i'll just lever those bones over and the scissors make it real easy to snip all that off save that for the sauce what's left are these tendons that are so huge on a big turkey they're like little bones they make most of the turkey leg virtually inedible but with this method we can pull them out i wish i could say you can grab them with a paper towel or your scissors but honestly pliers are the tool for the job grab the tendon by the end hold the meat back with your other hand and pull hard you can pull all those out like porcupine needles save for sauce same over here saw out under the femur that's free cut down along the knee and the tibia peel some meat off the sides grab the thigh bone get under with the knife and saw out toward the ankle scissors are great for snipping where those tendons join up down near the ankle bones are free use the pliers to pull out the tendons the wings honestly you could just cut off whole and throw them in with the sauce there's not much great meat on them i am deboning the upper portion by just cutting straight down along the humerus and peeling the meat off the sides in chicken wing terminology this is the drumette that's some good meat i'll slip my knife under the bone and saw out the winglets i'm not going to bother fighting for and certainly not the wing tip at the end all of that will just cut off whole and save for the sauce now i'll just look around for anything left that i don't want to eat any little bits of cartilage hanging around any super blubbery globs of fat if i'm gonna go through all this work i want the roast that i have left to be 100 edible and all these trimmings are great for sauce last thing is i'll just flip back these pectoralis minor muscles also known as the poultry tenderloin just fold them out and the meat will sit at a much more even thickness to that same end i'll butterfly the thickest part of the breast a little bit just one or two shallow cuts to that thick part to get it to lie a little flatter so that it will cook in the same time as the rest i know this looks like a failed experimental surgery right now but just wait till it's cooked we're done

thanks fetch rewards back to the scene of the crime i'm not the biggest fan of this but with everything wide open here it would be very easy to do a quick salt cure or dry brine on this meat just put on as much salt as you would normally use to flavor this much meat no more no less might as well put on some other seasonings while we're here lots of pepper and maybe some herbs dried thyme and sage classic for the holiday and also nice on this side would be some garlic powder and onion powder okay flip her around and that looks better already doesn't it but a 20 pound bird all flayed out like this is too big to fit on my baking tray i could cut it in half through the breast and have two mirror image halves but i'm going to snip the leg quarters off there's basically only skin attaching the breast to the thigh here so it should be very obvious where to cut and now i can put my dark meat on one tray and my white meat on another that's a bonus they cook really differently and now we have independent control over them again as much salt on the skin as you would normally use to season right before cooking no more no less it's mostly going to be absorbed into the meat during the curing process pepper two and i'll do some of those same herbs but no garlic or onion powder those things tend to burn under intense dry heat they'll be protected on the underside but not on top here last thing is to kind of tuck any exposed meat up under the skin when the meat is exposed in the fridge it goes leathery when the skin dries out it gets crispy and delicious in the fridge uncovered the point here is to dry out the skin like they do for peking duck normal food safety protocol is to put raw meat at the bottom of the fridge in case it leaks you don't want it leaking down onto your food but i'm pretty sure these trays are secure and if i put them on top my kids won't be able to reach them when they're groping around in the fridge for snacks them bones and they go to my roasting tray with the neck the skin any trimmings i'll cut a couple of onions in half and drop those in in the oven at like 400 fahrenheit 200c to roast and develop some brown flavor after like half an hour i'll squirt on a little tomato paste that will not make this tomatoey it'll just boost the umami in the end and darken the color a bit then i'll flip the pieces around a little tomato paste on the bones is a pretty common trick for demi-gloss i find that if i put it on at the very beginning it burns whatever you do don't let anything burn like see i'm starting to get a few black bits there that's bad with a demi-gloss all the flavors get majorly concentrated i should have pulled this out a few minutes earlier that was about an hour and normally i'd transfer these into a big stock pot but i'm gonna try simmering this right here in my roasting tray it's already dirty and i think it'll be just big enough the culinary school types tell you to start a stock in cold water this is because the albumin protein found in meat does not dissolve in hot water i don't think it makes a meaningful difference but i am using my filtered water from the fridge because everything is going to be concentrated and the knoxville tap water does not taste so great making water was way better i'll be able to get everything submerged as it all cooks down and softens this is super optional but for some umami boost i'm throwing in a handful of dried porcini turkey gravy is often boosted with mushrooms tastes real good some whole peppercorns in and maybe bay leaves will do something in there i doubt it bring that up to a boil reduce to a simmer i don't have a lid for this so foil two pieces i'll just let that go for a couple hours and here we are looking good i'll stir everything around and things are starting to fall apart so i can get everything submerged now gotta top off the water though to have a nice stock to make gravy you could honestly stop right there but i'm making demi-gloss which is thickened with gelatin not starch so i need to dissolve all the collagen in there into gelatin which will take a while i'm now about to go to bed so i'll give it one more stir top off the water and make sure it's just barely bubbling i don't want all that water to evaporate while i'm asleep because then everything would burn here we are the next day simmering roasted bones for this long tends to throw off some pretty intense smells don't be dismayed if it's kind of gross at this stage i used to do this on a hot plate outside until i got a decent kitchen exhaust system grab a bone and if it breaks real easy that's a sign you've extracted all you can i simmered this about 16 hours it's the day before the feast now i'm just fishing out most of the solids this will make it a lot easier for me to pass everything through a strainer in a sec before i take these to the compost i'll pour any liquid from the bowl back in now i'm going to bring this to a boil and reduce it down by maybe a third just so it's smaller and easier to deal with here's a cheat a packet of unflavored gelatin you don't have to do that we've got plenty of gelatin in there already but this is for a big feast i want lots of sauce to feed lots of people and a little extra gelatin will allow me to get that texture that i want without reducing it down quite as much that powder tends to clump so that's why i'm letting it boil for a while to dissolve and then everything is going through a sieve you gotta cool this down fast and there's lots of ways to do that today i'm doing the huge bowl filled with ice water and the smaller bowl nested inside sieve on stock goes through i was sure to stop boiling this before it thickened up very much at this stage if you reduce it down too thick a lot of it will stick to the remaining bones and such and you'll lose it plus if it's too thick the fat will not separate out as cleanly as we chill this down it won't be able to escape and rise to the surface you can already see that fat rising up stir this around let it transfer all its heat down through that metal bowl and into the ice water it's amazing how fast this cools down which is good because it's a high protein low sodium low acid solution that could be very hospitable to microbes 10 minutes later give it one more stir it's barely lukewarm i'll pull that out cover it up because fat absorbs smells in the fridge you can also put this in the freezer if you're in a hurry later that same day here we are the fat has surfaced and solidified or has it that's plenty cold but it's still pretty liquid which means this turkey is relatively low in saturated fat it's not like doing this with beef where the fat is a solid puck on top that you can just lift off this is still pretty easy though because the stock underneath is a very firm block of jello i'm not penetrating it at all as i scrape the fat off the top that's plenty clean and now you could totally just make the world's best gravy by frying an equal quantity of flour in this fat to make a roux let it brown a bit stir in the stock boil until thickened you're done but i'm not doing that this time i'm going to save this fat for a thing this meaty jello i will transfer to my widest pan or at least as much of it as i can fit in there i'm not making that mistake twice get that boiling down and concentrating until syrupy a meat glaze this concentrated cannot hold fat inside itself without a lot of emulsifying help so that's why we had to get all the fat out to make demi-glass now i can fit in the rest without any danger of this boiling over you don't have to stir this constantly until it starts to get really syrupy then you gotta move it stuff could stick to the bottom or the sides and burn that's looking very nice tasting very nice i think i'm gonna put like a glass of white wine in there i think that'll brighten this up give it some floral notes that'll be very festive and the sweetness will be nice but really really stir or do this at a lower temperature for a much longer time it'd be a tragedy to burn it and there's lots of sugar in there now that sugar burns a gelatin thickened sauce like this will be much thicker at eating temperature so when you think you're close you might want to turn the heat off a bit and then assess i'd say that's looking just right time to season there's no salt in this yet other than the salts that were naturally in the animal this is hilarious it is so glossy that my camera cannot focus on it then you can just scrape all that into a bowl chill and reheat tomorrow tomorrow is today the big feast all you do is pull the trays out of the fridge after 48 hours the skin is really dry and most of the salt has been absorbed deep into the meat which is good if you're into that 400 fahrenheit 200c i will stop and baste the skin once or twice if you want crazy crispy skin do not baste just rub the skin down with oil before you put it in the oven and never touch it again there's some water in these basting juices that'll reduce our final crispiness just a little bit but i think the flavor will be better so that's a trade-off i am comfortable with if this turkey was on the bone it would take five hours at least off the bone it's been just over an hour and the white meat is almost done the dark meat is done normally dark meat takes longer than white meat but off the bone the pieces are way smaller there's more surface area so that's already at 185 fahrenheit 85c and that's my preferred internal temp for dark meat you can cook it a little bit less white meat you definitely don't want to take past 160 fahrenheit 71c carryover heat will easily take it a few degrees further into what they say are the minimum safe temperatures as it rests i might put the dark meat back in the oven just to warm it back up again if you want more color just jack the heat way up at the very end but i think turkey tastes best when it's kind of blonde so there's everything enough meat for a dozen people at least if this were gravy that wouldn't be nearly enough sauce but this glaze is far more intense than gravy so you don't need as much however if you want more sauce volume you could stir in a bunch of butter at the last minute as long as the heat is really low nothing is bubbling you should be able to melt this in without breaking the natural emulsion of the butter people often finish demi-gloss-based sauces with butter it works great if anything it makes the flavor much more delicious it changes the texture it maybe makes it a little warmer or fluffier on the palette that's the only way i can think to describe it the pure demi is just more glazy i actually set aside half of my demi to keep it pure you're only looking at the other half right now and by slowly melting in butter i've nearly doubled my sauce volume which is great for a big family meal give that a taste and re-season especially if you used unsalted butter here's half of that breast ready to slice and lauren is always the skin thief [Applause] that's so good indeed the salt cure and the air drying have made that skin incredibly crisp and tasty and here's the best part of this whole deal i can just slice this up on the board it's not up in the air stuck on top of a giant rib cage there's no bones to work around nothing inedible it could not be easier on the day of this is so much less stress than a conventional turkey dinner and the difference is even more dramatic on this dark meat normally the skin on the dark meat is soggy because it was down on the bottom submerged in juice this is so crisp and normally you can slice hardly any meat off of the leg because of those bony tendons every slice here is totally clean totally edible and cooked way hotter than the white meat which is the way that i think it's best you might want to let everybody know that they should go easy on the sauce it's way stronger than gravy and since the skin is so crispy it's nice that we don't have to wet it all down with sauce now i will tell you that i am not a fan of brined turkey meat a wet brine gives it the texture of cheap bologna a dry brine like we did here makes the texture a little too firm for me and i think the uniform saltiness provided by either one kind of drowns out the subtle flavor of turkey i prefer to have my sauce bring the salt and if i were to do this again i would do it the exact same way but i would not salt the turkey in advance maybe i'd salt the skin a little bit to help it dry but i'd season conventionally right before the oven that said maybe i'm crazy everybody else seems to love poultry brines so you do you and don't forget side dishes i've got a few linked in the description and if you follow this method you'll have a lot more time and brain space on the day of your feast to cook those side dishes or you can make your family cook them i mean you deboned a whole damn turkey haven't you done enough somebody give you a beer

The OnePlus 9 Pro is a premium flagship Android smartphone with an amazingly powerful Hasselblad camera. Lauren and I had...,29:02.6, this video is an ad for one plus corn pudding is a classic thanksgiving side dish here in the southern united states is it a bread is it a cake is it a custard a casserole sure yeah all of those whatever it is it's good with gravy on it sometimes it's just a box of sweet cornbread mix and a can of creamed corn but since i don't feel like settling when it comes to my thanksgiving i've worked up a somewhat more decadent version you'll notice my wife lauren is giving you some behind-the-scenes shots today with our new phone from the sponsor of this video oneplus i'll be telling you about that as we go the oneplus 9 pro is a premium flagship android smartphone the company's whole philosophy is to never settle on anything which is why they've partnered with the legendary camera company hasselblad to capture amazing photos check out how nice these camera shots are so i'm slicing up one bunch of green onions about 100 grams corn pudding is generally sweet and i think onions help it to taste like not a dessert got a nice shot of your guns thank you dear the white and semi-white slices go in the mixing bowl i'll reserve the greens for later a couple fresh red chilies will also cut the sweetness and look real pretty on top thin round slices on those note the smooth motion of that oneplus camera lauren's got the super stable feature on if you don't want your pudding super spicy stop slicing when you get near the top of the chilies most of the capsaicin producing glands are up there if you can get a fresh ear of sweet corn it would be very nice to shuck that and slice off the kernels where i live we can get super sweet varieties into late fall if you can't no worries just drain a little can of sweet corn or use frozen corn i've got like a cup of whole kernels there 100 grams and half of them go in the bowl then it really wouldn't be corn pudding without two 15-ounce cans of creamed corn 850 grams total cream corn is disgusting i mean it's fine if you feel that way but the sweet starchy goo in these cans is a phenomenal binder and moistener in a cake or a casserole one more processed delight a 14 ounce 400 gram can of sweetened condensed milk that's not exactly traditional but milk and sugar are traditional and this is milk and sugar but better i'mma crack in four eggs that's really what makes this custardy some people would use even more i can't get over how that one plus camera moves smoother than my giant camera does with all its expensive stabilization hardware she's just holding it in her hands all right for dry ingredients i'm doing a cup of cornmeal 150 grams if you want your pudding less bready you can cut this in half i'm using a quarter cup 30 grams of cornstarch some recipes call for all-purpose flour instead i think that pushes the texture fully into the realm of cornbread the starch gets you a pudding texture two teaspoons of coarse salt maybe 10 grams to help balance the sugar to give my pudding a thanksgiving stuffing vibe i'm doing a teaspoon each of dried sage and dried thyme those are the stuffing herbs and then i'm doing a heaped tablespoon of baking powder for leavening maybe 12 grams last ingredient for the fat in the pudding you could use butter you could use oil what i have here is rendered turkey fat which i saved from a thing gross and uh we're gonna use that instead gross but delicious pretty much though melted butter would be traditional and very good as well about half a cup of fat 115 grams maybe which would be like a stick of butter and you might as well use whatever fat you're using to grease up the pan i've got a nine by 13 inch casserole here you could do this in a smaller pan if you wanted it thicker time to just stir this batter up until reasonably smooth it's as simple as that and in it goes in the pan it should look very loose if it's thicker than pancake batter you're gonna get cornbread not corn pudding and just because it's for a holiday dinner i'm being fancy and scattering my onion greens on top with my red chili slices and half of my fresh corn kernels very festive and it goes to an oven at 375 fahrenheit 190c for about a half hour which believe it or not is all the time it takes to charge this phone up full the oneplus 9 pro has the fastest charging solution in north america 1 to 100 in 29 minutes oh check out lauren doing phone selfies the pudding is done when it's a little brown on top and it looks and feels barely solid it should not be as dry on the inside as bread or cake would be what i like about this corn pudding is that it's an all-in-one thanksgiving side you could have this and no other sides it's your bread it's your stuffing it's your vegetables it's sweet like a sweet potato side and it's great with gravy on top or in this case some turkey demi-gloss that i made i'm not a fan of gratuitous sauce drizzling shots but the slo-mo function on this oneplus camera just had to be tried smash that subscribe

***RECIPE,...",29:02.6, because cream of mushroom soup is so popular as a canned good it kind of has a low-class reputation but i love the stuff so what i've tried to do here is make high-class cream of mushroom soup it's a bit more expensive and more finicky than my typical soup recipes but it's honestly the best thing i've had to eat in a while it's very strong very delicious if you really like mushrooms and i do but the first thing is an onion peeled and roughly chopped it's going to get pureed so it doesn't have to be pretty at this stage pot on reasonably high heat some olive oil in there and i'm just going to stir this until it's soft and starting to brown you'll notice i'm using my chrissy teigen pan not a soup pot this is going to go a lot faster if i cook it in a wide vessel a narrow soup pot just doesn't have as much hot pan surface area after about seven minutes in the pan that's good enough in goes a couple tablespoons of butter you could just use more olive oil instead an amount roughly equal in weight to this quarter cup of all-purpose flour that i'm stirring in to make a roux about 30 grams of flour if you have enough fat in there you can stir it into a thick paste it might look too dry until you cook it for a minute a roux will loosen up when it really gets going and i'll just gently brown that for a few minutes just for flavor before it burns we'll need something to deglaze the pan a wise man once said i've got my cavazier right here actually it's hennessy any cognac any brandy would be fine or whiskey any liquor aged in a wooden barrel goes amazing with mushrooms in my opinion it's like tasting the essence of the forest the tree and the fungus that grows through it i probably put in a whole cup of cognac 240 mils but we obviously need a little more liquid so i'm just slowly mixing in about two cups of plain water if you put it in all at once it'll be hard to stir out the lumps i used plain water instead of stock because this is going to be my stock dried mushrooms any kind i'd say buy one of the cheaper varieties these are my takis and i try to snap apart the biggest chunks as i drop them in this recipe will have fresh mushrooms but the flavor base is dried mushrooms an ounce total 30 grams each of these packages is half an ounce dried mushrooms are a far more potent source of umami and shroomy flavors than fresh mushrooms are but some people are bothered by the tiny grains of sand that are often stuck in them you'd have to look real close to these porcini to see anything oh you noticed the green glasses why yes they're from

mail and that's it order the winning pair online do your free at home try on just go to warbyparker.com regucia it helps me when use my link which is in the description thank you warby parker and if a little sandy grit on dried mushrooms bothers you here's how you deal with it bring some water to a boil the microwave is fine take it off the heat stir in the mushrooms they rapidly start to grow which opens their structure and helps release any sand let it sit for maybe a half hour and you've got what they call mushroom tea the liquid from the first steep usually contains most of the flavor from the mushrooms to keep out the sand you can just throw a coffee filter into a strainer and pour the tea through keep the mushrooms behind the sand is so small it would go through the sieve without the coffee filter in there that is a huge amount of flavor we just put into the soup then you can just throw the mushrooms in but the package tells you to give them a wash in case any sand is still sticking truthfully i almost never bother with any of that the sand doesn't bother me and rarely have i even noticed it i just throw them in dry you do you so i've got an ounce 30 grams total of dried mushrooms and 4 cups total of water almost a liter i like at least a couple tablespoons of worcestershire sauce in here yes it's made with anchovies you could use soy sauce instead or a yeast extract like marmite or just skip it i'll grind in some pepper to start with the worcestershire sauce brought enough salt for now and at this point i'll just cover this so not too much evaporates and simmer on low heat for at least a half hour an hour would be better during which time i can work on my pound of fresh mushrooms about half a kilo whatever kind you can get these are cremini these are baby shiitake and i've got a few big chanterelles in there i'll just give everything a quick rinse to get off any big chunks of dirt still on them time to trim off any woody bits of the stem and slice thinly i think thin slices are better in something as delicate as a soup these cute little shiitake i might just cut in half i want to see the identifiable shape of mushrooms in the finished soup this might look like a gargantuan pile but it's really the minimum you need they're going to shrink down considerably here in my widest pan i've got a mixture of hot olive oil and butter in there i like that combination with mushrooms but whatever fat you use use a lot of it i'll put in a pinch of salt and some pepper to start with i think you really do taste the seasoning the mushrooms absorb in the saute it doesn't all get dissolved in the soup later the wider the pan the quicker this goes i need to boil most of the water out of them before i can really start browning them while i wait i can peel and chop a few garlic cloves that i'll put in with the mushrooms right at the end we're getting there now cooking these down also concentrates their flavor i think that when you make soup things need to be very strongly flavored because they're going to be diluted by a lot of water in the end and now that these are dry enough they'll start getting really golden brown almost done so in goes the garlic and i'll fry that for a couple of minutes until i see the little pieces just starting to go golden there's some good brown stuff stuck to the bottom of that pan we can deglaze might as well use the same brandy as before derpy derp de derp hello i forgot that'll happen on a gas stove i'm used to electric with gas you gotta turn the heat off vapors or droplets from high proof spirits can escape and ignite on the open flame but no harm done this is perfect heat off here's my suit base after about an hour and honestly you could just throw the fresh mushrooms in with the rehydrated ones right now and call it a day but the dried ones are still a little leathery and i think we can get even more flavor out of them by pureeing this as smooth as possible a food processor or a carafe style blender would probably do a better job but i just think the stick blender is easier to get out of the cupboard and it's easier to clean plenty smooth that is and you could eat it just like that totally or if you're feeling extra fancy you could pass it through a fine sieve this will get us a silky smooth texture in the end just grind around on the fibers with a wooden spoon and you'll have surprisingly little waste in the end i'll rinse that pan out real quick before we pour this back in i generally hate pureed soups because every bite is exactly the same that's what the sliced fresh mushrooms are for heterogeneity they're safe to go in now and it's time for the eponymous cream in the cream of mushroom soup if you don't want dairy use coconut cream instead i might pour in as much as a cup 240 mls by the end but i'll be conservative up front stir that in and have a taste needs a bunch more salt and some fresh pepper right here at the end and now you just boil this for a few minutes until the cream thickens up a bit boil it gently if the cream gets way too hot it can kind of curdle in there maybe i want a little more cream what i don't need is any more acid because i've used a lot of brandy and that stuff is surprisingly acidic when you concentrate it if you had to skip the brandy and you couldn't use white wine or anything instead i'd put in a splash of vinegar at this stage apple cider vinegar be particularly nice you don't need much it certainly won't be enough to curdle the cream we are done that's probably enough soup for four or five dinner size portions twice that as a side or an appetizer for pretty you could drizzle a little more cream on top for company it might be nice to give them an assortment of fresh herbs they can stir in at the table whatever they'd like i think this tarragon goes very well with mushrooms it's a licorice flavor and it sure looks pretty some whole young parsley leaves instead would look awful nice too and i think my favorite herb for this is time i always think fresh thyme tastes kind of like the ground in a good way it's mossy thyme with the mushrooms and the brandy aged in wood it really is like eating the forest that broth has a very powerful mushroom flavor from the dried mushrooms you can drag some garlic toast through that if you want you can freeze any leftovers just reheat it gently to keep the cream from splitting but if you love mushrooms as much as i do leftovers will not be a thing

makes these awesome caramel brownies and for years after i left home she would bake them whenever i came back around and she remembered that i like them refrigerated so they're extra chewy like pull the fillings out of your teeth levels of chewy to make them chewy you got to get yourself one pound 454 grams of soft caramel candies and unwrap every single one of them this will take a while it's a good job for small hands which is why my niece is helping out good thing too it used to be my job i can't emphasize enough you got to do this with soft chewy caramels i don't even want to know what hard caramels would do in this recipe maybe explode we're going to take a package of german chocolate cake mix yes cake mix one of these standard boxes that's just under a pound 432 grams i'm sure any box cake would be fine as long as it's chocolate pour it in here and don't worry it's gonna make brownies not cake brownies are chocolate cake but with proportionally more fat and less water so they're too heavy to rise i give this to my lovely assistant igor to get rid of the fat will be three quarters of a stick of softened butter 85 grams and what little water we'll be using comes from a third of a cup of evaporated milk save that can we'll use more later a third of a cup is like 80 mls this is the same thing as sweetened condensed milk but with no added sugar make sure you use evaporated and not sweetened condensed otherwise it'll be way too sweet and then we are going to stir all this together you could totally do this without an electric mixer but it'll be a bit of effort to keep this from being cake we have to majorly restrict the moisture content there aren't even any eggs in there so when it finally starts to come together it's going to be extremely thick it looks like clay and that's probably about right and that's it for the mixing everything else is going to get layered in we should have preheated the oven but we didn't so we'll do it now i'm going to say something but i figured you had a no i didn't have a plan no oven at 350 fahrenheit 180c another third of a cup 80 mils of evaporated milk goes into those caramels in a heat-safe bowl this goes in the microwave for like a minute and then check on it you want to get it just hot enough that it'll melt into a thick caramel sauce and you won't know if you're there until you start stirring and spreading the heat around you could do this in a pot over low heat on the stove that'd be fine but just barely melt it either way if it gets too hot it could kind of seize up or even burn you'll also want to get a cup of chopped nuts ready maybe 150 grams those are pecans but you could use anything back to the chocolatey dough so now what we're going to do is we're going to take half of this mixture like break it up with your fingers spread it over the pan just in little dollops all over this nine by 13 inch cake pan it could be any size in that neighborhood and then you actually pre-bake those bits for like five minutes until they look like little cookies i know that's weird but go with it so we're gonna sprinkle six ounces of chocolate chips on top that's a cup 170 grams darker chocolate would probably work better here everything else around them is super sweet sprinkle on that cup of chopped nuts making sure you get the edges and the corners and then we're going to pour the caramel on top of that lovely stuff but if you over bake it it goes past chewy and becomes straight concrete that's why we had to pre-bake the bottom layer of the cake mixture you got to give that a head start so that it will be done by the time the caramel is done now i take the remaining dough and distribute that over the top don't forget to put a blob in each corner yeah the cake mix is so thick that it's going to barely spread in the oven so you got to get it into the corners yourself but it's good that it won't spread that means that after it bakes you'll have some surface that's cake and some surface that's caramel heterogeneity so here we go 18 minutes 18 minutes in my mom's oven at least every oven is different just pull it out when it still looks a little underdone like that it should be very soft when hot as it cools that caramel is going to firm up a ton so you got to account for that here it is cooled down on the counter the same night we baked it still has a bit of a gooey vibe if you're into that personally i am not i like it the next day refrigerated now it's so chewy that it occupies a liminal space between cake and candy you know i talk a lot about my italian american heritage on this channel but this dessert speaks to my waspy heritage from my mom this is what i think of as an ohio recipe having grown up in ohio it's it's quick it's easy it's tasty and it contains

My old video on...",29:02.6," Hey, can I tell you about my gas problem?
Gas burning stovetops. There's a lot of problems with them. I mean, there's a lot of good things
about them too, but you always hear about the good things. The biggest good thing is
that they are responsive, meaning you ignite them and they're instantly hot. You throttle
them down, they instantly cool off. At its core, it's a very simple mechanism. It's a
pipe. On one end of the pipe, there is a highly combustible and relatively clean-burning hydrocarbon,
and on the other end of the pipe, there is a fire. And then midway through the pipe,
there's a valve that opens and closes it. The more you open the valve, the more fuel
pours into the fire. And it's a literal fire right here in your home. So, it's romantic
in that way. The original cooking over an open fire, right here in your home. I get it. I was excited when I moved into
this house and this house came with a really nice, really expensive gas burning stovetop.
I hadn't had a gas stovetop since this really sketch apartment that I lived in briefly in
college. I was excited to try it. Here in the United States, electric ranges are twice
as common and as gas ranges, according to these estimates from the federal government.
So, naturally I've cooked on way more electric ranges in my time. I've been lucky enough
to cook on some good ones, and the good electric ranges are simply way more powerful. When we first moved in here, both my wife
and I noticed that it was taking a lot longer to bring pots of water up to a boil, usually
for pasta. How can this be when gas is more responsive? With electric, you turn it on
and it does not get hot instantly. It takes a few minutes to get up to heat. With gas,
you just turn it on and instantly it flames on. So how could it be that the water was
taking longer to boil? Because even though the heat comes on immediately,
there is less of it. Like over here, I'm going to start a slow pour. Several seconds later,
I'll start a faster pour. That cup is going to fill up way faster than the other one even
though the stove signified on the left there got off to a later start. Gas stove is on
the right. When Consumer Reports reviewed 171 current model ranges, the electric ones
clearly beat out the gas ones on the boil test. Not every single model, but in aggregate,
electric simply gets you more heat. Why is gas weaker? Well, technically it might
not be. Depends on the model of course. But it might just be an issue of efficiency. Gas
stoves are, generally, far less efficient at actually transferring their heat into your
food, and here's proof. This is a real thermal imaging camera — not one of those fake infrared
camera app filters that just simulates a thermal image. You're seeing real heat. Look at the
heat billowing up around the pot and escaping out into the kitchen. I'm not stacking the deck here. I've got this
small pot on my smallest gas ring. The ring and the pot are well matched. Now let's boil
some water on an electric burner, and see? The pot is hot, but there aren't the same
plumes of heat swirling up around it and away. It's just the nature of the beast that with
a gas stovetop, the pan has to be suspended up and away from the actual heat source, and
the gap in between the heat source and the pan is a place where heat can just get away. By way of example, look at all the heat that's
getting wasted on heating up the iron grate that the pot is sitting on. See how hot those
bars are? That's all wasted energy. When you're thinking about buying a stove
and you're looking at the thermal output ratings that the manufacturer lists, you got to think
about what they're actually telling you. Here in the United States, they would be sold by
BTUs per hour, which is British Thermal Units, how much BTUs it can put out in an hour. Well,
what are they telling you? Are they telling you the heat that the stove can in an hour?
Or are they telling you the heat that actually makes it into your pot over the course of
that same hour? Only one of those numbers actually matters, right? And in their defense,
I don't think they could actually tell you the number that matters, because it depends
on the pot, how much heat is actually going to make it into the pot. Now there are some new high-tech gas ring
configurations that are designed to address this problem by focusing the fire up a central
column. That's awesome, if you can get one of those. Though keep in mind that a billion
or more people actually depend on the heat leakage that they get from a traditional gas
ring like this. I'm talking about the billion or two people who cook primarily in woks. You cook in a wok, you actually want the heat
to wrap up and around the outer cone of the pan. That's why they make these electric burners
that woks can actually nest inside. If you mainly cook in a wok, this problem of heat
leakage might not even be a problem. Remember, this video isn't about your gas problem, it's
about my gas problem. And my problem is it takes way longer for
big pots of water to come up to a boil on here. It takes longer for me to reduce down
sauces and glazes. Devotees know I'm a glaze man, all day long. Another problem is that
the heat leakage tends to overheat things that are outside the pan, like this thermometer.
On an electric stove, you could just leave a thermometer hanging on the side of the pan
and like that, even if the display is not heat safe. But on the gas stove, I'm very close to melting
the plastic on that. The chicken came out good anyway. Of course it did, it's from the
sponsor of this video, HelloFresh, America's number one meal kit. Let me tell you about
them for a sec. You want to talk about efficiency? HelloFresh is all about it. The carbon footprint
of a meal in a box like this is actually lower than a similar meal cooked from groceries,

I'm going to have to stow in my cupboard somewhere and figure out how to use. Plus, I can cook this in less time than it
takes me to grocery shop. The average grocery trip is 41 minutes. I mean, I still cook from
groceries too, obviously, but it's awesome to have HelloFresh take care of me instead

HelloFresh. So yeah, my other gas problems. Stuff around
the pot tends to get it way too hot, not just thermometers, but spoons. I used to love perching
my stirring spoon on the side of the pan. I can't always do that on my gas stove. Depending
on the shape of the pot and all that, the spoon can literally burn, or burn me when
I go to pick it up. That's just a minor inconvenience. The bigger
problem I get is the scorching that I get around the inside rim of my pans. You can
see evidence of this right there. The walls of my pans tend to get so hot on this stove,
and sauces especially have a tendency to burn up there on the rim. This is a custard that
I was working on, I could not stop it from burning on the side of the pot. And now I
understand why so many people cook custards over double boilers, which is a thing I almost
never had to do on my electric stove. That burning happened even though I had my gas
heat all the way down, as low as possible. And that's another gas problem. All the way
down is often not low enough. You can only close off the valve so tight before there's
a risk that your flame goes out. If the flame goes out, you'll end up pouring uncombusted
gas into your kitchen, and that would be bad. So, these burners are designed to never let
you throttle them down so low that there's a risk of the flame going out. Unless you
have a special warming burner with just a few little holes in it, low heat on a gas
stove is never going to be that low. Look at this giant pot. That's on my smallest burner
turned all the way down, and it's still simmering that sauce way too aggressively. I had to
babysit that pot way more than I wanted to, to make sure that the sauce didn't stick to
the bottom and burn. My old electric burners, I could get way lower. And here I do need to clear up a definition
of electric. Here in the U.S., most electric burners are just a coil of wire. It resists
the current that you flow through it and it gets red hot. It's basically an incandescent
light bulb that you put a pan on. Whether that coil is out in the open or underneath
a smooth ceramic top, it's the same basic technology. This is my old glass top stove,
and it's just a wire coil under there. As I have been fortunate enough to reach a
global audience via this platform, I have found anecdotally that a lot of people in
Europe and some other places tend to assume that glass top equals induction, and that's
not true. Here in the U.S., we have lots of resistance coil stoves that are under glass
tops as well. Induction is a totally different heating technology that also is usually under
a glass top, and it's a different thing. It's a cool thing. I've got a whole video about
induction that is linked in the description. Basically, it's making heat with magnets. This little burner I have here is an induction
burner, and I'm pretty confident that induction is the future. Resistance coil stoves, even
if you get them really low or really high, they have to cycle on and off to maintain
their temperature, which gives you peaks and valleys in your heat. Plus, resistance stoves
really are unresponsive. If your pan gets too hot, you can't just turn the heat down.
There's going to be a lag during which the heat is still really, really hot on that burner
and things in your pot could burn. So in an emergency like that, you have to
move the pan off the burner, which is an easy thing to do in a domestic context since I'm
rarely cooking on every part of my stove at the same time, but I can understand why that
would be a pain in a professional kitchen. Tons of professional kitchens around the world
though are switch to induction because the heating is way more steady, the temperature
controls are way more responsive, and the stoves are much more energy efficient than
gas. Or are they? This is a really complicated topic now. I'm not talking about heat transfer
efficiency from the stove to the pot, I'm talking about energy efficiency of the whole
system. By some estimates, gas is far more efficient
in that respect, in part because you lose less energy in transmission with gas. Nonetheless,
people concerned about the environment and climate change are generally allied against
gas stoves. Depending on where you live and how your power is generated, a gas stove really
may have a lower carbon footprint, but it is inherently a carbon footprint. You are
burning a non-renewable hydrocarbon here, and it is a hydrocarbon the extraction and
use of which generates greenhouse gases. The electricity coming out of your wall socket,
well that might be coming from a fossil fuel now too, but it might not be doing that forever,
right? They could get it from some place else in the future. So surely this is one reason
why environmental groups have funded research into the various problems with gas stoves,
including their health hazards. This is a major literature review released in 2020 by
a coalition of such groups. And here, the research is pretty clear. Gas
stoves are far more likely than electric to bring potentially dangerous gases into your
home. For example, nitrogen dioxide, NO2. Research has shown that the kind of NO2 concentrations
you can get from gas cooking, these are associated with asthma and developmental problems in
kids. Nitrogen oxides smell like absolutely nothing, so you wouldn't know you were breathing
them. That rotten egg smell when you first turn on the burner? That's an additive designed
to tip you off if there's combustible gas in the room. A fiery explosion is certainly
a greater acute health risk, but odorless hazards like nitrogen oxides could be a significant
chronic health risk, especially in little kids and people with breathing problems. When I first moved into this house, it took
me embarrassingly long to discover this retractable little ventilation thing here. It's a downdraft,
because this is an island cooktop. Works pretty good. And so I've tried to get in the habit
of turning it on and using it even when I'm not making a lot of smoke and stink. When
it's just normal cooking, I try to use it anyway. And I try to cook on the back burners
closer to the vent so the stuff is more likely to go down the vent and I'm not hanging over
it as directly and breathing in the gases. Though honestly, I'm more worried about my
kids in this respect. I mean, please do not go out and replace a
perfectly good gas stove because you're worried about its carbon footprint. I'm pretty sure
wasting it and buying a new one would be way worse for the environment. But I can tell
you right now when this old girl peters out, I'm going induction. At the very least, I
think glass tops are way easier than gas to clean, but you do you."
Bagels made with malted barley syrup | NY-style boiled,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RHU4gQz-EDI/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLCXOYKa-STwR8_R76rp8mbaub9MqA,RHU4gQz-EDI,"10 minutes, 3 seconds","Thanks to Surfshark for sponsoring this video!

My old, simpler...",29:02.6, i wanted to see if malted barley syrup really is the secret ingredient for bagels and i think it is look at that blistered caramel colored crust i've never gotten that on bagels before now i have a simpler bagel recipe using honey instead of malt syrup that is linked in the description if you want to get a little more involved with your bagels stay right here the very chewy new york style bagels that i miss and can't buy where i live require crazy levels of gluten development to that end i'm starting this dough with an autolyze one and three quarter cups water 415 mils bread flour which is high gluten flour water in a big bowl and into that i'll put basically as much flour as i can easily mix in i started with like four cups which is just under 500 grams i'm not needing this for the purpose of developing the gluten i'm just trying to get all the flour wet it should take like 30 seconds and i'm gonna make this little nest in the center for reasons that will soon be clear hey it already looks like one giant bagel cover with a wet towel or something to keep it from drying out and leave it for at least 20 minutes but an hour is better in that time enzymatic things happen that basically knead the bread without you even touching it you'll see okay malt syrup i have a video about what this is in the description i'm just eyeballing a couple of tablespoons you can order malt syrup online it's a specialty baker's item but i found this particular brand is also sold in health food stores weirdly i mean it's sugar but i bought it at whole foods hashtag not an ad i made an effort to get a little syrup into the belly button there to which i'll add a quarter cup of warm water 60 mls and then in goes a packet of dry yeast to bloom one sachet as the brits would say is just over two teaspoons anything in that neighborhood is fine i deliberately got some syrup in the hole to feed the yeast but not too much there is a point where too much sugar in the solution will slow them down and i'm gonna stop speeding up the footage now that is happening in real time right there i love that part it started happening after like five minutes oh we need some salt in there like a tablespoon of morton kosher for me 15 or 20 grams and then check this out the gluten is already really developed in here this is so elastic too slippery to need some more flour will help with that it'll function as whatever the opposite of a lubricant is i'm skeptical of a lot of the claims made about the autolyze or pre-soak method that we've just done but one thing it does for sure is reduce the amount of hard work you have to put into needing a very chewy bread we're halfway there already and for bagels the name of the game now is to knead in as much flour as this dough will take whatever it will absorb get it in there i got in almost two more cups my basic kneading technique by the way is really just to rock my body back and forth like i'm having a panic attack or something gather the dough up lean into it with all my weight gather it up lean into it with my palm that's a lot of force exerted without much effort okay see how sticky that still is that'd be like okay for pizza dough but it would produce bagels as flat as pancakes gotta jam more flour in there for me i actually like somewhat thinner bagels than the traditional new york style shape i use bagels primarily for egg sandwiches and a thinner one is easier to eat and fewer carbs frankly so i'm gonna stop when there's just a tiny bit of stick still left to this you want really tall bagels keep kneading until it will accept not a single particle of flour more gotta keep this from drying out while it rises but the towel could get all gummed up on there ah a dome that should keep us safe oh hey you can see me that's kind of creepy i don't like being watched but that reminds me i can kill the next hour or two on the internet much more safely with surf shark the sponsor of this video i open the app hit connect and surf shark routes me through one of their thousands of encrypted servers all over the world a virtual private network now my isp can't spy on me nor can

and ads there's surf shark alert which can let you know if any of your passwords and such have been compromised there's surfshark's own search tool which has no ads or tracking while your dough is rising follow my link in the description use code adam ragusia and you'll get 83 off surf shark with an additional three months for free link and code in the description save 83 thank you surf shark okay two hours later my dough has just about doubled i'm gonna punch it down which has the effect of bringing the yeast into contact with fresh sugar to ferment and in the process of doing so i will divide this into three even chunks then divide each of those into two and then divide into again and now i have a dozen dough balls for a dozen bagels i'll form each into a reasonably smooth ball by the way if you want tall bagels you could also knead some more flour into the dough now after the first rise the flour is better hydrated now so the dough is stickier and it might accept some more flour at this stage but anyway time to just let these rest for like a half an hour nah not big enough the towel will be fine we really just need to let the gluten relax for a few minutes that'll make the bagels easier to shape while i'm waiting i'ma grease two sheet pans in the past i've had trouble with my formed raw bagels sticking to the flour or the parchment paper or whatever i put under them while they did their final rise so this time i'm going with grease so you can form bagels by pinching a hole in the center of the ball and then stretching it out today i'm doing the other method where you roll the ball out into a snake about yay long and then you wrap the snake around your hand with the ends overlapping a little bit under your palm and then you just roll against the counter to close the seam to twist the ends together surprisingly easy and effective just pull it off your hand the hole at this stage should be bigger than you want it because it's going to close up as the dough contracts a little and then it puffs up filling up that space again roll into a long snake wrap around your hand with the ends overlapping underneath roll to close the ends together having a little trouble getting it off my hands ah you know why i gotta lay the snake over above my thumb if i leave my thumb out of it that is way easier to slide off nice this method gets me something i used to love from the bagel shop i grew up with where there was a thick fluffy side to the bagel and a thinner crispier side of the bagel heterogeneity you could cook these after like a final half hour rise but i'm gonna loosely tent these in plastic just to keep them from drying out and slow rise them in the fridge probably get some better flavor this way good night take them out the next day and i'll peel the plastic off while they're still cold and firm less likely to have sticky deformations like that while those warm up a bit i'll get my boil water going it occurred to me the widest pan i own is not a pan but my big roasting tray this will give me way more room to work and you want to leave yourself plenty of height in the pan when the water gets all starchy and sugary the surface tension increases and you get big bubbles that could boil over get hot people get hot i'll mix up a little everything bagel seasoning which will just be three or four teaspoons of sesame seeds a mixture of white and black if you have some black ones this is pretty two or three teaspoons each of poppy seeds dried onion flakes dried garlic flakes and then a couple of teaspoons of coarse salt that should be just enough for a half a dozen bagels i'm gonna leave the other six plain and i'll need some egg wash and egg beaten with just a little water to loosen it up so barley syrup goes into the boil water too how much i have no idea i'm just gonna stir in enough until it looks about as brown as the water that i've seen in bagel shops something like that ah maybe a little bit more don't let it burn on the bottom there no i'm not gonna do a spoonful of baking soda in there some bagel makers do that to enhance browning but i think it just makes the bagels taste like pretzels arguably they are pretzels pretzels are bread boiled in high ph solutions that's a pretzel time to throw these in and man they are way easier to get off the greased trays without deforming them nice we can fit half a dozen in there easy you boil them for like a minute or two on each side 90 seconds in i'm gonna start flipping that's not going to work and that'll do it i have so much room to work in this roasting tray this is so much better than doing this in a big saute pan or a dutch oven i don't want greasy bottoms on my finished bagels so i'm going to lay a parchment sheet on there before i start fishing these out i've seen bakers loop them with a stick that looks cool but yeah that one broke that shape reminds me of something anyway real quick i'll just dip the tops of each of these into the egg wash and then into the seasoning mix if you don't eat eggs you can just dip the wet starchy bagel into the seasoning it'll stick just not as well i know what this looks like this looks like the engineers ship from the alien movies nice all right let's boil the plain bagels again i'm doing like 90 seconds on each side the longer you boil the chewier they will be this is i think the main difference between real bagels and prepackaged grocery store bagels those fake bagels are steamed not boiled which is cheaper for mass production but it obviously gets you bagels that are really soft and doughy these are going to be super chewy which is what i want and that barley syrup covering the crust is going to do magical things in the oven and we go 425 fahrenheit 220c convection if you don't have a convection fan i'd go a little hotter after like 15 minutes i'll rotate the pans just to make sure they bake evenly and 10 minutes after that i have amazing blistery brown crusts on the plain ones the topped ones usually need a couple minutes more just because they have a little more mass on them i do not claim to understand the science of why that maltose-filled syrup gets you a better crust than honey or other sugars i'm just happy that it does other than these being a little bit thin which i like these taste just like the new york style bagels that i grew up with in the freezer they'll go and we'll have egg sandwiches every sunday for six weeks hooray
Malted milk coffee cake,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/glnawqMzJBk/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLAos5W8EmchMguhfkawisSmwms6Aw,glnawqMzJBk,"5 minutes, 25 seconds",Thanks to Sensodyne for sponsoring this video! Drink coffee without fear. Brush with Sensodyne Repair and Protect with Deep Repair toothpaste twice a day to repair and relieve the sensitive...,29:02.6," This is an ad for Sensodyne. Man, did I find the secret ingredient to improve
my coffee cake — and no, it's not coffee. In the U.S. coffee cake refers to a cake to
be eaten with coffee, perhaps as a totally unjustifiable breakfast. The most common coffee
cake is basically like this, a buttery yellow cake with a cinnamon-flavored crumble on top
called a streusel. First step is to bring all the cold ingredients
up to room temperature. Two sticks of butter, 225g. A couple eggs and a cup of buttermilk.
In the U.S. this is a fermented milk product. You could substitute it with equal parts regular
milk and yogurt or sour cream. Gotta wait until that butter is squishy. Might
as well put some water on the boil and make a cup of coffee. Hey, maybe the steam will
warm up the butter. Coffee is a pleasure I've had trouble enjoying
much of my life thanks in part to my stupid pain from tooth sensitivity. Something really
hot or cold gets on my teeth and ZAP — these little twinges of pain. But I've got it under
control these days because I brush with Sensodyne, twice a day, everyday. Sensodyne is the #1
dentist-recommended toothpaste brand for sensitive teeth. Sensodyne Repair and Protect with Deep
Repair toothpaste is designed to repair and relieve the sensitive areas of your teeth,
when used twice a day. Its active ingredient builds a repairing layer over the sensitive
areas of your teeth and protects them from tooth sensitivity pain. Don't be afraid of
your coffee — that's no way to live. Wednesday is National Coffee Day here in the States
— get ready for it. Life’s too short for sensitive teeth. Brush with Sensodyne and
make sure this moment of your morning is the creature comfort that it should be. Thank
you, Sensodyne. OK, butter is now soft — you could do that
in a microwave on very low power. And I'll put a quarter of that into a bowl to make
my streusel. Sugar. 100g, half a cup of brown sugar — or white sugar with a dab of molasses
because that's all brown sugar is. And then 60g, half a cup of flour. Without the flour,
it wouldn't be a crumble. The the topping would just melt. And here's the secret ingredient: malted milk
powder. In the U.S. it's sold as a drink mix in normal grocery stores, usually in the coffee
isle. Half a cup, 60g of that. And I really like the streusel to be salty, so I'm going
like half a teaspoon of kosher salt there. Then, honestly, the best tool for mixing this
up is your finger tips, even if that's a little messy. It's kinda like mixing up a pastry
dough — you're looking for a heterogeneous mixture with big clumps. The color of this
doesn't look quite right — hmm. Well, set that aside and while my hands are
dirty I'll use some of my butter to grease the inside of this cake pan. It's a 9-inch
square pan, 23 cm. You could just spray the inside, but the buttery edges are gonna taste
real good. Alright, in the batter bowl with the remaining
butter. So that's a stick and half, 170g, softened. 200g or a cup of sugar. I prefer
white sugar in the batter, not brown. This way I can put in an obscene amount of vanilla
and the color will still be bright yellow. Now we're creaming the butter and the sugar
— using the abrasive power of the sugar to cut little air bubbles into the fat. You
want to keep doing this until it's really fluffy, like that. Time to crack in two eggs.
I'll beat them in one at a time, mostly to avoid splattering. Again, get that mixture
really smooth and fluffy. Time for the buttermilk — just a phenomenal
way of giving cakes a little tang and a moist, heavy mouthfeel. There's the aforementioned
obscene glug go vanilla. Maybe a tablespoon. Whip all that in, and at this point it might
start looking a little gritty, a little cottage cheesy. It'd be way worse if the butter and
eggs were still cold. Don't worry — it's gonna smooth out when we mix in the dry ingredients. Another half cup, 60g of that magic malted
milk powder. This just gives the cake an incredible, caramely depth of flavor. A couple teaspoons
of baking powder. If you don't want the acidic taste of the buttermilk you could replace
one of these with a quarter teaspoon of baking soda. That would neutralize the buttermilk
and help leaven the batter. I'm doing half a teaspoon of kosher salt,
because I'm using unsalted butter today. And I'll start mixing with just a little bit of
the all-purpose flour. Mix that smooth, and then gradually I'll mix in the rest. About
2 1/4 cups of flour total, 270g, but I think you kinda have to look at it and adjust. I
think a cake like this tastes best when it looks just a little wetter than cookie dough.
That's a little too wet. A little more flour, and there, that's perfect for me. In that goes to the pan, and some people put
in just half of it, smooth it out — and then, I'm not gonna do this, but you can make
a pretty ribbon in the middle if you sprinkle on a layer of brown sugar, maybe darken the
color with a little cocoa or ... cinnamon! That's what I forgot over here in the streusel.
Like a whole tablespoon of cinnamon. Mix that in. That's why this did't look right. No need
to get it homogenous. I think it's better if it's not. Anyway, rest of the cake batter in — super
luxurious batter. Smooth that out, and then sprinkle on that crumb. I really like to have
a few big chunks on there, so I might even squeeze some into chunks as I lay all this
down. Perfect. In we go to an oven at 350ºF/180ºC. If you
use convection you might want to take it down 10-15 degrees so the topping doesn't burn.
45 minutes later your house should smell like a Charles Dickens story — the ones about
Christmas, not murder. Not quite baked yet — look how dirty that
skewer to the center came out. This one took just under an hour. And we'll need to let
that cool all the way. Time to cut, and when it's fresh-baked, you'll notice the streusel
is hard and crunchy, almost candy-like. Personally I love that. I love the texture contrast.
It's chewy yet crunchy on top of the soft cake. But, if you wait to the next day, the sugar
will draw a lot of moisture out of the air and soften a ton. This is probably the texture
you're more used to. I like this too. And remember, they call it coffee cake for a reason.
Thanks to Sensodyne for sponsoring this video and for helping me enjoy this moment without
sensitive teeth pain. And there is my totally unjustifiable breakfast."

Sign up here https://cen.yt/mbadamragusea9 for your free daily newsletter — I’ve really enjoyed Morning Brew and I think you will too!...,29:02.6, broccoli is unsurpassed as a sponge for sauce and god i love a sweet glossy chinese-american restaurant-style garlic sauce this is a really easy and cheap meatless meal incidentally vegan the way i'ma do it please don't take this as traditional chinese this is just me riffing off of the strip mall restaurant classic i love first thing is get like half a cup of rice going 100 grams that's enough for me and lauren but you might want more wash and drain wash and drain a few times to get off the free starch coat if you want fluffy chinese style steamed rice i'll throw in like 1.75 times the rice volume in plain water no salt for this style of rice heat on high and today i'm trying this method i've heard of where you don't cover it at first you just bring it to a boil and let it cook until the surface gets pockmarked like that the rice is peaking up above the water level now you cover take the heat down and let it steam for like 15 minutes or really until this dinner is ready it'll be quick it's a garlic sauce so three to four cloves of garlic peeled and i'll peel a little thumb of ginger about as much as the garlic i always start by slicing ginger across its fibers against the grain that makes it easier to chop fine later and you can skip this but i'm doing a little fresh chili maybe half of it chop all that up pretty fine man does that combination smell good in a little dish and set that aside my beloved chrissy teigen pan it's a steep sided saute pan if you don't have something like this i would use like a little soup pot or a dutch oven you need something tall with a lid just an inch of water in there and these expandable steamer baskets are the best they're cheap they're compact and they fit any pan lid on heat on high if you don't have a steamer you could boil the broccoli instead of steaming it one medium to large crown like this will feed two stand it upside down and that way it's really easy to go around and cut off perfect little florets once you get down to the tip the individual florets are too small so i just cut off the whole thing and trim it into like three or four bites the stem you can cut into slices and cook with everything else or not then it's just a matter of cutting the biggest of these in half or maybe thirds bigger pieces will look prettier and remember they're going to shrink a bit so i say go big water is boiling so in goes all the broccoli you can pile it high in the basket the steam will come up through everything cover and cook in my opinion just three minutes that's just enough time to fill a big bowl with water and chuck in some ice cubes i want to pull these before they are fork tender though you can use a fork to lift out the whole basket and sploosh into the ice bath stir it around until every piece is cooled off blanching and shocking like this is really popular in restaurants because we have deactivated the enzymes that turn green into brown the texture is one tiny step away from perfect and it'll stay perfect in the water there for hours if you need it to we have zero rush now we are gonna need like a cup of water or stock for the sauce and hey i've got this broccoli water right here i'll admit it's not the best brew i've ever had morning brew is way better the sponsor of this video morning brew is a free daily newsletter covering the latest in business finance and tech i've been waking up to it for a year they give you your stocks and briefly explain what the numbers actually mean then it's just super tight story summaries that respect your time and intelligence often funny facebook but for your face seriously facebook is making ray bans with computers and oh a food story jp morgan is buying zagat which is basically the american michelin guide i guess bankers love restaurants and i love how morning brew bullets out all this text making it skimmable i'm read up in five minutes it takes 15 seconds to sign up for morning brew with my link in the description it's totally free there's no catch just use my link thank you morning brew all the water is out of my pan so i can put the heat back on like medium and there's my sauce ingredients just a little plain old cooking oil just to film just to fry the garlic chili and ginger for a minute just until it's soft and starting to go golden before it burns in goes the 240 mils or one cup of water broccoli water could be plain water could be stock but i don't think stock would make a big difference with all these much stronger flavors going in i'm using like a teaspoon of onion powder not necessary but nice definitely need the soy sauce i'll start with like a quarter cup 60 mils most chinese garlic sauce recipes call for vinegar and some call for ground mustard seed well guess what this is a couple of teaspoons of any tangy mustard traditionally you'd get more umami and some gooey texture from a giant glug of oyster sauce yes it really is made with oysters you could do that or a fish sauce i'm gonna go back to my old british buddy marmite a giant spoonful of this it's a yeast extract so it's vegan if you're into that it's really nutritious it's got your b vitamins that are hard to find without animal products it brings a wallop of umami and tons of glossy gelatinous texture i love this as a sauce ingredient just don't expect me to spread it on my toast brits time for sugar the oyster sauce would have brought sugar and most garlic sauce recipes call for even more some honey or some brown sugar i'm starting with like a tablespoon of white sugar and a glug of molasses because sugar plus molasses is all brown sugar is and i actually want more molasses than is normally in brown sugar i swear this sauce will not taste like a gingerbread house it's gonna taste like chinese food a teaspoon or two of toasted sesame oil just for flavor very strong stuff i tried putting this in at the beginning and frying the garlic mixture in it and it burned every time it made the sauce bitter save it to the end i'll grind in some pepper you can maybe do a little dash of chinese five spice if you have it time for thickener cornstarch or any refined starch maybe a couple of tablespoons whoops that's a little too much but it's good to have some extra ready to go and mixed into a slurry put in just enough cool water to where you can dissolve it by smashing it up with your finger well technically it's not dissolving the starch granules are merely dispersing through the water and they'll sink down to the bottom if you let this sit for more than a minute okay sauce is simmering one hand stirs while the other hand drizzles in the slurry if you don't stir as you drizzle you'll get giant starch globs that'll be really hard to break up and if you just threw dry corn starch in the pan it'd instantly form huge lumps i'll hold the rest of my slurry in reserve there that may seem extremely thick already but we can always water it down and the broccoli is going to release some water into this and thin it out heat down the sauce can very easily stick to the bottom and burn when it's this thick have a taste and remember this needs to be strong enough and salty enough to flavor itself all the broccoli and all that plain unseasoned rice it should be too sweet too sour too salty too umami i'm gonna reach for some good old msg that's the brand name that it's sold under here in the states accent this is the traditional thing you could put in plain salt if you want but either way get the sauce really salty if it needs more acid put in more mustard or vinegar if it needs more sugar do it all we got to do now is reheat the broccoli i'll gather that up wring out as much water as i reasonably can and in it goes it'll cook and soften that last little bit that it needs as it warms up in here and gets coated yeah that sauce is too thick to splash in some water not too much i still want it pretty gloopy i don't know i'm not sold on this bring the rice to a boil uncovered thing that's pretty dry maybe i should have started with more water that's fine notice how bright green the broccoli is and it's going to stay that way for a while because we blanched and shocked it if we had just stir-fried it it'd be gray by now and i think steamed broccoli has a brighter fresher flavor got a spoon over that excess sauce to flavor the rice and if you have some whole sesame seeds in the cupboard hey why not i think broccoli is totally substantial and meaty enough to be a main ingredient if you don't overcook it if it still has a lot of snap really satisfying to bite into especially when it's coated in meaty sugar glaze meatless meaty sugar glaze at that

Free shipping within the U.S. Financing...,29:02.6, here's a simple practical way to make baked alaska which is this 19th century fancy pants restaurant dessert of cake and ice cream layers baked inside a dome of meringue yes baked ice cream what i'm going to show you is way easier and i think better first the cake i've got a nine inch square cake pan 23 centimeters you could do these quantities in a bigger pan but not a smaller one we're gonna fill this past the brim which is one reason i'm being sure to get plenty of excess when i cut out a parchment square and then i'll snip diagonals into the corners those slits will help the paper lay snug inside the pan it doesn't have to be a perfect fit but if you see little bits that are going to curl into the cake you can just snip those off that's good enough grab a little mixing bowl and i'll put in half a cup of cake flour maybe 60 grams all-purpose flour would be okay about one and a quarter cups of powdered sugar maybe 150 grams you could use granulated sugar instead it'd be about three quarters of a cup if you did that half a cup of cocoa powder 50 grams i'm using dutch cocoa but natural be fine if you want a yellow cake instead just replace the cocoa with more flour that substitution doesn't always work but it will with a dense cake like this a teaspoon of baking powder a small pinch of salt now time to separate four eggs i'll just crack them into a bowl and fish out the yolks the whites will need to make our meringue and instead of making the cake a more traditional sponge cake which would also require whites i'm gonna use these yolks to make a very rich devil's food cake this way no egg goes to waste throw those whites in the fridge for later more wet ingredients for the cake i'm doing half a cup of greek yogurt like 140 grams you could use sour cream instead 1 3 of a cup of milk 85 mils water or coffee would be fine instead then lastly half a cup 120 mls of any neutral cooking oil mix and mix well real fast for a few minutes just to get some bubbles started in there my goal with these ingredients is to get a cake with a lot of protein a lot of liquid fat and not much water why because the cake is going to be frozen i don't want it icy hard when i bite into it oops i forgot the vanilla big splash of that anyway the high protein and high liquid fat content will give us a pudding like consistency when it's cold butter and solid chocolate would lock up real hard in the freezer now that it's nice and smooth i'll pour it into my cake pan the weight of the batter will help keep that parchment in place and we go to the oven at 350 fahrenheit 180c how long depends on many factors i'd say start testing after 20 minutes to see if a skewer or a knife or something comes out of the middle clean i want to give this another few minutes i'd air on the side of it being a little overcooked since it's going to soak up some moisture later from the ice cream let that cool on the counter for a bit looks as soft and cushy as my mattress from helix the sponsor of this video helix is a premium mattress in a box company we actually have two the king size we sleep on and the queen we put here in the guest room my folks came and stayed with us and i swear this is true my mom came downstairs and said where'd you get that mattress it's so comfortable you just go to helix's site tell them how you and any bed mates like to sleep side stomach super firm whatever and helix suggests a model for you it literally comes in a box under vacuum compression break the seal and you might think it would be really soft and squishy and they have super soft ones if you like that but this one is quite firm and solid it's a real very high quality mattress i find both our helixes support my back better than our old mattress i sink in just enough and then it supports you can pay as little as a dollar a day with a special financing plan they're offering until september 19th however you pay click my link in the description and get up to two hundred dollars off your helix plus two free pillows you also get a hundred night sleep trial along with a 10 year warranty helix sleep dot com slash ragusia thank you helix anyway let that cake cool a bit and then transfer to the freezer we need it real firm when we smear the ice cream on top at least half an hour in there i'd say at some point you want to take out your ice cream i need two of these pints to cover that cake leave them out until they're just squishy we need the ice cream soft but not melted on it goes to the cold cake layer in blobs i'm doing strawberry flavored so i get this neapolitan ice cream vibe chocolate strawberry and vanilla layers but obviously you can use any flavor you want since we laid it in blobs it's already pretty even now so i don't have to do very much to smear this solid since the cake is cold it shouldn't be damaged by this but i'm still being pretty gentle back in the freezer with that to harden up the ice cream layer during which time i can make the meringue get a little pot and a big heat tolerant mixing bowl egg whites go in there in the pot goes a cup or 200 grams of granulated sugar plus half a cup of water 120 mils also a squeeze of corn syrup if you have it honey would work too and get that boiling on high heat in the egg whites goes half a teaspoon each of cream of tartar and corn starch and get it beating you could use a little squeeze of lemon or a dash of vinegar instead of the cream of tartar and you can use any starch not just cornstarch these additives will serve to stabilize the foam keep it from collapsing or squeezing out water no need to stir the pot over there the squeeze of corn syrup makes it virtually impossible for that sugar to crystallize as it cooks get the egg whites to stiffish peaks like that and when the syrup hits about 240 fahrenheit 115c it's time to very carefully drizzle it into the eggs as we whip please be careful hot syrup is dangerous once you've got half of it in you can dump in the second half much faster and keep whipping i would never bother doing this without an electric mixer of some kind the side of the bowl feels quite hot now we're making italian meringue which is a pre-cooked meringue it does not need to be baked the hot syrup cooks it and gets you a marshmallowy vibe in fact this is often called marshmallow cream or marshmallow fluff marshmallow cream is italian meringue when it's glossy and doesn't seem to be getting any fluffier it's done but i'm continuing to whip it to cool it down i don't want it so hot that it melts the ice cream but i still need it a little warm if it's not warm it'll be impossible to spread it's perfect when you can touch it and it feels just a little warm now you can whip in a little splash of vanilla without evaporating much of its flavor i've got a little pinch of salt in there too just for taste whip that in out comes the pan again and very quickly before the meringue starts to set up scrape it all in there and smooth it out to an even layer you can see why this is the smallest size of cake pan that'll work for these quantities and the parchment has to be going all the way up in the freezer again to harden at least a couple hours but here we are the next day grab a cutting board and now you can very easily lift the whole thing out with the paper the sides of the paper should peel off real easy and now we can slice if you have a long sharp carving knife that would be best whatever the knife wipe it down after each cut if you want really clean edges i think if you cut this into six pieces those are pretty good portions last thing to do is brown the meringue like it would have browned in a very hot oven traditionally this is a cheap little fire stick it does okay but it takes a little while if you have a kitchen torch or are a welder by trade that's gonna be a lot quicker i love how the warm and toasty marshmallow on top contrasts with the cold ice cream and the cake is firm but not icy it's chewy and solid enough that you can lift the whole piece to your mouth without it breaking apart another alternative to the torch would be to douse the cake in a very high proof spirit turn off the lights and carefully ignite with the fire stick or a long match this is a trick that would have worked great in old-fashioned fancy restaurants because they were so dark if the lights are on you can't really see the flame so there you go bring some retro kitsch to your next dinner party it really isn't that hard

***ROASTED GRAPE...",29:02.6, the tremendously convenient sheet pan dinner concept is easily applied to pasta sauces very quick and convenient way to make delicious vegetable heavy pastas i'm gonna show you two recipes more like 2.5 and you can easily do them in the time it takes to boil the pasta oops there was a camera in that box of orichetti half a box half a pound 225 grams in salted water that's two portions get yourself one of them boxes of tiny tomatoes in u.s grocery stores these are the fresh tomatoes most likely to actually taste like something in any season they're pretty solid and you can wash them right in there it's a one pint box which is a volume measure maybe 12 ounces or 340 grams of grape tomatoes for two portions every single one cut in half you gotta be careful cutting around things i try to kind of clamp over the tomato with my fingers and then use a sawing motion rather than a pressing motion i saw with hardly any pressure at all at first until the knife bites through the skin until the knife bites you're at risk of either crushing the tomato or rolling it under your knife and losing control on those go to the sheet pan a shallot or any little chunk of onion i find quarter moons are a good shape for pasta cut each half down the middle then make thin slices across thin quarter rounds big enough to stick to the pasta small enough so they don't have the texture of slimy worms a few garlic cloves and for this recipe it actually helps to not chop them too fine big chunks are less likely to burn under the broiler slash grill and i've got a stick of rosemary here i'm going to chop this up and put it in the oven with everything else we'll get more flavor out of it by cooking it real good that will lose the bright green color no worries i've got some basil for that and you can slice a fresh red chili and put it on there too but i'll call this done pepper and salt on everything plenty of olive oil get in there with your hands get everything coated and spread out into a single even layer turn the broiler slash grill on high and slide the pan right under it if the element is red hot this should take at the very most five minutes more than

your first receipt a limited time offer thank you fetch so yeah as soon as my tomato skins are browning that's enough for me take it much further than that and the tomatoes will just fall apart which you know you might like drain those or ketty and i'm going to throw just half of them back in the pan i want to show you two ways to do this the first one being to just throw in your broiled stuff maybe a little raw oil just for the fruity taste you lose in the oven some fresh basil because it tastes good and will be bright green unlike the rosemary in there and then stir i want to stir it hard enough that some of the tomatoes break up and you get a little saucy consistency but if i stir too hard all the tomato guts will fall out of their skins and i just have tomato sauce with a bunch of skins swimming around it i'm not into that i still want intact roasted tomato halves in there to bite through a little cheese on top and sometimes i like a little fresh oil on the cheese super tasty super summery pasta couldn't be easier but what if you want something more like a tomato sauce well pasta in the pan sieve on top dump in all the roasted stuff grab a wooden spoon and grind push down as you swirl around if you have a food mill you could use that instead this is basically an improvised food mill and eventually there's nothing but skins in the sieve underneath is an incredibly fresh tasting tomato sauce it's got bright rawness but also some of those dark roasted flavors maybe it doesn't look too pretty since it's so refined but you can mix back in a few of your chunkies just to give it some texture maybe a little fresh oil tear in the fresh basil and toss to coat everything and there you go if all the skins were swimming around loose in there they'd be kind of gross that is silky smooth and would work fine without cheese but imma do cheese because i can it's amazing how different that tastes compared to a more conventional tomato sauce but now let's try something super unconventional it's a recipe i improvised the other day get another half a box of pasta boiling fennel one of my favorite vegetables cut off the stalks and save those for later take the bulb stand it up and carefully cut it in half take the halves and shave them slice as thinly as conveniently possible with the knife this stuff has the texture of celery but a mild licorice flavor and when those strips are just barely cooked they kind of feel like noodles in your mouth on the sheet pan radicchio also known as italian chicory texture-wise radicchio is kind of halfway between lettuce and cabbage i'll pull off any wilted outer leaves there and just barely shave off the root end because i want the core intact i'm gonna cut this into wedges and i need the core to hold the leaves together the flavor of radicchio is bitter pleasantly bitter though it mellows out a bit when you cook it the italians often grill it which i suppose we're going to do if you're among those people who call a broiler a grill beans cannellini beans drained rinsed and tapped a little dry onto the pan with those time to season everything with pepper and salt not too much salt on the beans they're already salty a whole bunch of chili flakes to make this spicy and then i'm doing caraway seeds i love these my wife doesn't nor does she like the licorice flavor or bitter greens can you tell she's out of town today olive oil everywhere tossed to coat everything and get it flattened into a single layer and under the red hot top element once again while we wait for all that to brown i'll harvest the green fronds from those fennel tops i found out the hard way that when you use these to garnish food they can kind of look like green body hair it helps to chop them up a little bit first after a couple of minutes the beans should start to explode literally explode love it it helps them break down into a sauce and they brown very deliciously four or five minutes total that tray is done drain the pasta throw it back in the pot and then i'll scoop in a bunch of my roasted beans just the beans because what i want to do now is stir this really aggressively i want to mash up the beans just enough so they'll form a paste and bind everything together a bit in goes all my other good stuff and that pot does not offer enough space in which to toss everything together hey you know it would work better the pan it's already dirty and it's already warm so it won't suck the heat out of this a drizzle of fresh oil and i'll scatter on my chopped fennel fronds now i've got plenty of space to toss this around easily four portions of food there even though there's only half a box of pasta a really great vegetable heavy plate this is certainly it's great with some pecorino on top if you want quick roasted radicchio still crisp but nicely browned this mixture of pasta and beans is very reminiscent of sicily or of north africa which is no doubt where the sicilians got the idea and what would taste even more north african would be the vegan version of this squeeze on a bunch of lemon instead of grating on cheese toss and this is very tasty warm but you could probably chill this and call it a pasta salad if you wanted the moral of the story is take little bits of whatever you have throw them on a sheet pan under the grill for a few minutes and toss everything with pasta it's pretty tough to go wrong

***ASPARAGUS...",29:02.6, shrimp is uniquely well suited to sheet pan dinners that is a meal where you throw all the components on one baking sheet toss it in the oven and you're done it's the universe's gift to weeknights i'll show you two sheet pan dinners with shrimp first thing is to get a pound of shrimp thawing unless i get them from a guy with a boat i'm pretty sure i get the freshest product frozen just cover them in cool water and leave the water trickling they'll be thawed in 10 minutes and smaller shrimp would thaw even faster meanwhile we can prep vegetables asparagus cooks in the exact same time as large shrimp i usually take off the upper rubber band and leave the lower one go rinse those and then feel with the knife for the spot where the stems go woody it's literally lignin the stuff that turns plant stems into wood the lignin creeps up higher the older the asparagus gets and unfortunately this is pretty old so i had to take off a lot but it was all contained by that rubber band on the sheet pan with those spears i'll peel and chop a bunch of garlic for those i like a lot of garlic on asparagus i'm going to roast some big chunks of shallot you could use any kind of onion but the shrimp is our benchmark i gotta cut things into chunks that will cook in the same time as those pretty good size shrimp we've got when i cut the root ends i'm taking off only a tiny sliver because i want the base to hold those layers together on the sheet pan some corn on the cob it's in season one for me one for lauren this will be a generous protein heavy meal for two if it's fresh i like my sweet corn just barely warmed up so not on the sheet pan yet throw all that onto the compost i'll prep my fresh herb this is lemon balm which is exactly what it sounds like but parsley would be great instead i'm going big on the lemon theme today lemon zest plus garlic on asparagus is outrageous highly recommended save that lemon for squeezing when we eat shrimp is thawed i usually buy it shell on vein intact it's a lot cheaper that way somebody told me about this fork trick where you push the tines of the fork up the back and then theoretically that pulls everything off in one go not really working for me i'll go with my normal method which is to use kitchen scissors just snip along the back and this allows you to snip through the tail it's really easy now to peel off the whole shell including that bit on the tail i usually dump my shells right into that same bowl and the scissors have also left a shallow incision through which we can access the quote-unquote vein the shrimp's intestinal tract you can just pull it out that gets to be a big deal with shrimp this size you'd feel the sand in your mouth with little shrimp it doesn't really matter honestly for a weeknight meal you might prefer to buy pre-peeled shrimp no shame in that they're just a little pricier and maybe not as fresh when i'm done i'll drain those shells either freeze them for stock right away or get them out of your kitchen they'll start to smell rapidly then i can give these one more rinse they'll brown better if they're dry so a little paper towel on the pan shrimp on top dab them until dry time to season everything pepper on everything salt on everything they'll go easy on the shrimp shrimp tend to be soaked in brine as part of their processing you could do old bay or some other classic seafood seasoning on the shrimp i'm doing some garlic powder onion powder and smoked paprika drizzle everything with just a little olive oil a little goes a long way and then smoosh it all around get every piece of food coated in oil and seasoning with the asparagus you'll note the garlic pieces tend to slip down to the bottom that's good they'll be protected from burning down there i'm tossing the shrimp last so that i don't pollute the other stuff with shrimpiness though i suppose it doesn't matter what does matter is getting everything spread out to an even layer no two pieces should be overlapping now we can flip on the broiler slash grill it heats up so fast that you can do that right before you want to cook oh like my new glasses yeah they're

big would take maybe six minutes under there total while we wait we can cut our lemon into wedges for juicing i'll just check the pan once halfway through you could flip all the shrimp if you want they cook more evenly this way but sometimes i just leave them inside one gets super brown and crunchy while side two stays really moist either way is good with the asparagus you can just kind of nudge them to roll them around a little bit asparagus gets very meaty when it browns under the broiler and those shallots we can safely roll around because we didn't slice off the bit at the base that holds the layers together now is when i'll throw on my sweet corn whoops that is overexposed try that again if you like your corn more cooked you could have had them in this whole time like i said with fresh corn i really just want to warm it up a bit and three or four minutes under the broiler should do that just fine now i can melt a little butter on those and sprinkle with salt the lemon balm i'll scatter on my shrimp toss them around to wilt it a bit then everybody can dig in squeeze some lemon on grab a shrimp man i love a big chunk of roasted onion and i love how the pan keeps everything warm yeah we just told you you don't even need plates you just put the tray between you and you go to town that said you could feed more than two people from a single tray for this next one let's do a larger meal shrimp and tzatziki is an underrated combination to make it i'll need some grated garlic which means i need to peel it without crushing it rolling loosens the skin enough that you can peel it off you could chop it fine instead of grating one large clove like this will be very strong in tsadziki because it's going to be raw zest up a lemon you could skip that if you want to do vinegar instead of lemon juice i quite like fresh mint in tzatziki plus some fresh dill though you could get by with just one or the other chop them up fine and then all that goes into a bowl cucumber the ones sold wrapped in plastic here in the states are marketed as english cucumbers i really like them you don't need to peel them or seed them i'm only unwrapping half for now save the rest for later grate this half up nice and fine and traditionally you'd squeeze that in cheese cloth or in a sieve or something to get out the excess water smashing with a paper towel works fine too cut the lemon and then maybe squeeze in just one half for now you can always add later then plain yogurt i would guess about a cup for this much stuff stir that up and have a taste need salt pepper and a little olive oil in there is nice and i'm going for the rest of the lemon which will be very acidic but i'm not using this as a dip or as a side dish as you would traditionally in grease or turkey i'm using it as a sauce so i needed to be stronger and i needed to be thinner i want a drizzling consistency so it was dumb for me to bother squeezing out the cucumber juice i gotta stir in a bunch of milk now to loosen this up you can of course buy tzatziki if you make it yourself it's all the better to make it the day before it improves in the fridge now get my shrimp thawing as before a pound or half a kilo like this is enough for four people as long as you have plenty of other stuff this time i'll season them with cracked whole seeds i've got mustard seeds celery seeds i'll put in some chili flakes i want them big and chunky but if i smash them just a little in the mortar and pestle that'll release some flavor and it'll help them stick to the shrimp check out the girth of these leeks big leeks are good for roasting and whole rounds because you're going to have to sacrifice the outer layer or two there's simply too much dirt hiding underneath them once you have those peeled off give them a rinse and cut off the tops there's probably dirt hiding in there too have a look that one looks clean same thing on this one and nope look dirt we gotta cut a little further down to get past the dirt these you can pull apart wash off and throw in stock i like roasted leeks to be really crunchy and again i have pretty big shrimp so i need to cut these rounds really thick if i don't want them to go too soft if you like them softer cut thinner rounds i like them really crisp onto the tray since i have one i'll slice up a red chili to roast with the leeks it looks pretty and i'm going for a spicy vibe with this tray the leftover cucumber since i have it i might as well slice it thin and then we can have some fresh raw cucumber slices on the side which is always a nice thing to have with a spicy meal and for herb i've got this fancy purple basil plant beautiful but any herb could work more of the dill left over from the tzatziki peel the shrimp as before and dump it on the tray then i'll grab a can of chickpeas and drain it in a sieve and rinse man i love chickpeas but real talk they smell like dog food straight out of the can on the tray they go and i will blot dry both the shrimp and the chickpeas i want to roast the chickpeas brown and crunchy so dry helps my cracked seeds go on the shrimp let's do some harissa powder on the chickpeas any spicy seasoning would be great on them just throw some pepper on the leeks salt on everything but again go easy on the shrimp because they're already salty the chickpeas might be a little salty too depending on the can drizzle olive oil everywhere get in and toss everything to get it all coated and remember everything's got to be laid flat and evenly spaced i'll put those chili slices on top the leeks so they get charred charred chili is awesome under the red hot grill we go after about three minutes i'll flip some stuff around shrimp unfortunately is a food that you just have to cook yourself a few times to get a feel for doneness they're too small to get an accurate temperature reading on you just got to cook them and find out how done you like them and learn what that looks like i like them starting to get a little crunchy which they are after six or seven minutes and the chickpeas are exploding be careful they're basically like popcorn if you broil them dry super crunchy and delicious those are going to be make some room and throw on my cool cucumber slices scatter those basil leaves over everything then time to drizzle on my tzatziki sauce a nice cool combination with spicy shrimp what a feast this is easily enough for four people super healthy cheap and done in a flash if the leak rounds are too big to eat don't try cutting them up just try sliding off a few rings at a time nice i hope i've given you a few ideas that you could try the beauty of shrimp is it cooks in about the exact same time as vegetables so throw some on a pan with veggies and call it a night
Garlic naan grilled on oven grates,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RgfZikXWKMo/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLBEBGxty-Bk8iqrDaUpiTYLET6A1g,RgfZikXWKMo,"8 minutes, 48 seconds","Thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this video! Go to Squarespace.com for a free trial, and when you’re ready to launch, go to http://squarespace.com/ragusea and add code “RAGUSEA"" at...",29:02.6, this recipe is sponsored by squarespace you can bake really good naan by just grilling it directly on your oven grates i use the same method sometimes for pizza you need no special equipment and doing it this way has a lot of advantages is it the best homemade naan well the texture is a little different than naan they bake in a tandoor in a restaurant you can more closely imitate the real thing with the tawa method i have a whole video about this in the description you wet the bottom of the dough to make it sticky you throw it into a hot ungreased indian style flat tawa or a western style cast iron skillet like this works okay too you just cook it on the stovetop until you think the bottom is done you can't actually look at the bottom so you have to make an educated guess then you invert the pan the bread sticks and hangs upside down while you cook the top over direct flame works okay on a resistance coil stove too but not on induction then if you are able to unstick that from the bottom the result is indistinguishable from non-baked in a tender but this method is tricky i burned the bottom a little bit there and most significantly you can only bake one small loaf at a time with this oven method i'ma show you right now you could bake enough bread for a whole big dinner all at the same time it's all equally hot and crisp at the same time and it tastes really good this method will work with any typical non-dough this is my basic yeast non-dough though i'm doubling it because this method is great for baking a lot of bread four cups of flour like 500 grams a couple of teaspoons of sugar one teaspoon of salt i use morton kosher and that's not much salt i'm assuming you're going to put more salt on top later a teaspoon of baking powder i get better bubbles if i use that in addition to the yeast a couple of teaspoons of dry yeast you can throw in the whole packet only about two tablespoons of yogurt you could do a little more it tastes good but i find too much acid plus the yeast interferes with the gluten and it makes the dough short or crumbly a couple of tablespoons of oil and a cup of milk or water to start with 200 ml to start with start mixing with a spoon and add just enough additional milk to make this come together no more i'm using bread flour today instead of all purpose all purpose is fine but bread flour has more protein and more protein absorbs more water so i might need a fair bit more milk you won't know the moisture level for sure until you get in with your hand and really start kneading actually i think i overshot it on the milk more flour nearly every indian recipe i've read for nan says the dough should be pretty dry just barely sticky and you don't have to knead it to death at this stage just get it reasonably smooth and elastic the yogurt will make the surface look a little rough no matter how much you need it and see just barely sticky this is good cover it with a wet towel or something and let it rise until it's twice as big at least an hour probably two while you wait you can prepare your toppings i'm just doing the standard garlic naan thing i love it peel and chop a bunch of garlic then chop a bunch of cilantro or coriander leaf as they'd call it in india and get a little melted butter handy too you could instead make a no yeast dough which is also traditional my version of that recipe is in the description it's very similar but instead of yeast you use a lot of yogurt with active bacterial cultures in it for me i found the key is to let this dough sit overnight it rises much more slowly but here we are the next day and check how puffy that is i think this makes nan with better texture but i think the yeast dough makes nan with better flavor this is the yeast dough after a couple hours i'll punch it down and divide it into maybe four chunks maybe knead them just a little bit more and shape them into balls this will make four loaves that are each twice the size of the one that i did in the pan at the beginning of the video there we go yeah you can wash your hands before you do cover those let them rest for at least 15 minutes and they'll roll out much easier right before i roll i will do myself a favor and throw a baking sheet or a big piece of foil onto the bottom rack of my oven stuff is gonna fall and this will catch it and make cleanup really easy time to turn on the top element that americans call a broiler while brits and people formerly colonized by brits call a grill i love this thing it gets red hot in seconds and will replicate the intense direct heat of a tender grab a dough ball and roll it out almost as thin as you could possibly roll it you might need some flour to keep things from sticking or you might not get your toppings and smear them on then roll them into the surface hard for this oven method in particular it's important to get them really stuck in there and hey the virtue of this method is we can do multiple loaves at once so let's prep another one i could actually fit all four of these in at once if i wanted to take those over to the oven and this part feels real weird flip the dough around and put it topping side down under the broiler which you might call a grill don't worry the baking pan is going to catch anything that falls through the grates it's really easy to just plop those in with your hands because non-dough is very sturdy and not sticky close the door to maximize the heat in there and here we are after just two minutes if you get any giant bubbles like that you might want to tamp them down before they burn not with your hand you ding-a-ling use your tongs bake a little bit more and then you can just flip these around whenever the first side is golden there's no guesswork you can see exactly what's happening these just needed 30 more seconds and the top side will need a minute at most i think a defining feature of non is the top has some brown bubbles but most of the surface is still doughy that contrast is key why do we have to do this on the grates why can't we just put the dough on a baking sheet because the baking sheet would actually shield it from much of the heat the dough would take too long to bake you wouldn't get those big steam bubbles inflating and the inside would be dry by the time the outside was brown i find this method does a better job of imitating the intense heat of a tender than even a really hot pizza stone does naan doesn't seem to bubble upright on a pizza stone i don't know why but there you go all you do now is brush it with some melted butter if your butter is unsalted you probably want to either dissolve some salt in the butter or sprinkle some salt on top flavor-wise that tastes just like restaurant naan the top and the internal structure of it just like restaurant naan the bottom is the only thing that's different it's smoother and a little less crispy than it would be from a tandoor or a tawa it's not bad it's just a little different now what if you don't feel comfortable reaching into that hot oven to deposit the dough on the grates we'll just do this roll out your loaf as before top it flip it upside down on the counter and then gently roll it up around your rolling pin take it over the oven let your rolling pin reach inside there and you just gently roll it out topping side down that method is particularly useful if you want to bake one giant loaf and what could be easier one giant loaf cut it up and everybody gets their bread in one go if you bake a lot of loaves in succession though you might start to get them sticking on the grates like that that's from the grates getting dirty and or from the grates getting really hot under the broiler which you might call a grill if this happens to you the solution is to treat your oven grates like the grates on your grill what americans call a grill while brits and people formerly colonized by brits call a barbecue this is my outdoor grill scraper that i'm using to clean this up and all the junk falls onto that pan below if you still have any trouble with sticking you can do another outdoor grill barbecue trick and grease the grates with an oily paper towel no need to clean them after such a tiny film of oil is just going to burn off you do that and sticking is impossible but i only had problems with sticking after i've been baking nan on my grates for hours which you probably would never do because the whole virtue of this method is that you can bake all your non at once just as you can get everything done at once at squarespace everything you need to buy or make in order to create and

BBQ-style beef ribs in the oven | twice-baked potato,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FBll1Tk_DwI/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLDG9nobeYGMXbO5MmlM2hFktxsqxA,FBll1Tk_DwI,"8 minutes, 20 seconds",Thanks to Morning Brew for sponsoring this video! Sign up here https://cen.yt/mbadamragusea8 for your free daily newsletter — I’ve really enjoyed Morning Brew and I think you will too!...,29:02.6, here's a technique for doing great barbecue style ribs indoors in the oven it's stupid easy any kind of ribs would work but at my butcher they often have a few beef back ribs for sale it's a byproduct of boneless ribeye steaks it's great meat it's cheap and three is enough for my dinner as you can see these came cut into individual ribs even if i was buying a whole intact rack of ribs i would still cut them into individual bones before cooking them you just get more surface area that way more browning and they're easier to eat for this recipe i see no reason to peel off that membrane on the inside it'll actually help hold the meat together as they braise very soft real barbecue ribs are flavored on the inside by smoke we're not going to do that so i think it's good to do a garlicky marinade the night before just peel and chop some garlic then we'll need some vinegar and i'm going to marinate in a sealable bag but you could use a bowl first i'll salt the meat the salt is going to be dissolved in the marinade thus making it a brinenade but i put salt directly on the meat so that i can use the meat as a visual guide as to how much salt they need just remember you'll lose some to the brine so slightly over season throw these in the bag get the garlic in there a big pinch of sugar is always great in brines and marinades and then i'm using red wine vinegar but you could use any vinegar or lime juice and if you use a bag you really don't need that much because the bag will wrap around the meat and keep everything in contact i would dilute with a little water maybe one part to two parts vinegar if you marinate in straight vinegar or citrus overnight it can make the surface of the meat go mushy push the air out seal and get that all stirred up i'm getting the meaty side of the ribs facing down so that they're sure to be submerged in the fridge they go and good night next morning i'll grab a little baking tray and throw in the drained ribs i'm making some effort to scrape off the garlic its flavor is fixed in the meat all those chunks are going to do now is burn so who needs them all right i've got these positioned convex side up no idea if that actually matters it does matter for sure that you tightly crimp the foil around the top the moisture inside the meat is more than enough to braise it if you capture the steam in there i'm gonna have my ribs with a twice baked potato that's a russet a flowery potato and here's how i usually start baked potatoes coat the skin in a little oil and a lot of salt this makes the skin very tasty to eat after it's baked crispy stab it a few times like your norman baits just to let steam out and keep the skin from exploding and i'm going to flavor that potato with roasted garlic which means i'll need roasted garlic if you just need a few cloves and easy ways to cut off the root ends and leave the skin on throw them in a little scrap of foil coat in a little oil and then wrap them up tight all of that can now go in the oven the ribs the little garlic pouch and i like to bake potatoes right on the oven grates they get crispy all around close that up and i'll bake at 300 fahrenheit 150 c that's a good compromise temperature for the potato and the meat and it'll take about three hours this is a weekend meal for sure while you wait just pour yourself a brew and read yourself some morning brew the sponsor of this video having worked in news most of my career i now avoid much of it but morning brew doesn't make my head hurt like lots of other news it's fun it's a free daily newsletter on the latest in business finance and tech i've been reading it now for about a year here's the new us jobs report summed up in five sentences super quick but still with context yeah it's good news but jobs in some sectors like entertainment are still way fewer than they were pre-covered here's an indicator more weddings this year than any year since 1984. i guess there's a backlog to work through mazeltov do you and me both a favor sign up for morning brew via my link in the description it takes two seconds to sign up and it's totally free in your email every day hit my link in the description thank you morning brew now after an hour or so the garlic should be done roasting when it's golden brown and soft get that out before it burns baked potatoes are done when you pinch them and they're squishy they usually take like an hour but at this low temperature it'll probably take as long as the meat takes here we are after three hours and i just poke the meat if i can push the meat fibers apart with my finger then these are braised enough to fall off the bone though i don't actually want them to fall off yet gotta be gentle with these now the potato is squishy it's done here's all the juice and rendered fat from the ribs i'm gonna pour that off and save it i'll use some of it at this point i can just steal a little scrap of meat and taste it for seasoning these need a little more salt and now is a good time to put it on grab the potato in a little bowl cut the potato in half and just scoop out the flesh being careful to not tear the skin it helps to leave a thin reinforcing wall of white flesh behind we got plenty in the bowl and just mash that however you normally mash potatoes normally i'd enrich mashed potatoes with a lot of butter and loosen them with some milk you could do that but hey we happen to have some delicious fat and liquid right here already a spoon or two of rendered rib fats and some of that watery broth underneath just to get this to a smooth moldable consistency roasted garlic we cut the ends off the cloves so now we can just squeeze out their guts like toothpaste this stuff is divine you can spread it on bread it's sweet and not very pungent at all twice baked potato filling is usually bound with a little bit of cheese i'm grating in some pecorino but any firm or semi-firm cheese would do stir all that in get those garlic cloves mashed up and then taste for seasoning needs a little more salt and plenty of pepper some fresh herb will look and taste nice i'll scrape in a few time leaves there from lauren's plant stir once more and you could either split this filling between the two skins and have two thin potato pieces or you could pile it all in one skin and have one nice tall potato piece i'll do that don't need this other one now this one will bake one more time hence twice baked potato we'll also need a barbecue sauce for these ribs tomatoey barbecue sauce is usually either based on ketchup or on tomato paste and vinegar and sugar which is ketchup and because ketchup is strained or pulverized really fine the texture you get from it is super smooth and glossy i'll put in a spoonful of molasses like memphis style barbecue sauce you don't need it a big squeeze of mustard is great maybe some soy sauce you can just stir random stuff into ketchup and taste it until you like it a bunch of hot sauce in there then to evoke the taste of real smoked barbecue you could put in some liquid smoke or i'll just reach for smoked paprika one of my favorite spices stir that up and have a taste could use some more smoky paprika also some more pungency and more acid well guess what hot sauce is chilies in vinegar you just use vinegar everything we've done until now you could do way in advance this last part is quick and you do it right before dinner throw the ribs under the broiler that very hot top element there after a couple of minutes you should start to smell some very intense roasted steak-like aromas i'll pull those out and rotate them no sauce for me yet i want to dry out the surface texture a bit and get some nice dark brown flavor on these before i coat them in wet sugar can't brown them much after i do that now is a good time to throw in the potato again i do it right on the grate to keep the skin dry and crispy two or three minutes later all sides of the ribs have browned and now i'll put on some sauce you can just spoon it on but a brush allows you to paint on a very thin layer which is what i want i want a thin layer that will dry under the broiler keep an eye on it sugar burns very fast under the old grill after a couple of minutes i'll paint on a second thin layer it's kind of like building a piano finish in woodworking paint on some lacquer dry it sand it down paint on another layer this will get us lots of concentrated flavor from the sauce and the ribs won't be all wet and gloppy they'll be sticky get all those sides which we can access because the ribs are already cut into individual bones whole intact racks are just more convenient when you're feeding a bunch of people you can flip and baste them all together in one big piece but for a portion or two pre-cut ribs are great here's our beef flavored twice baked potato awfully nice crust on that and after just a couple more minutes under the grill check out how tight and dry these ribs look i love that laminated finish you could always have more of your sauce on the side some more thyme on there just for pretty might seem like a huge portion but remember like half the mass here is bone and gristle that you'll leave behind and we've cooked these so soft that the meat just slides off the other stuff into your mouth but again i was careful to not let the meat actually fall off the bone to me there's no point in ribs if you can't gnaw them off the bone yourself like a cave person sure the flavor isn't the same as real barbecue ribs that you smoked outside all day these are very different but still very good and way way easier
Pavlova with pastry cream (marshmallowy meringue with pudding on

classic meringue dessert of australasia crispy on the outside marshmallowy on the inside i love it in the summertime my version replaces the traditional whipped cream topping with a pastry cream made from the leftover egg yolks i really prefer how the pastry cream tastes though it does present some hazards step one is get the oven heating to 350 fahrenheit 180c for a light dessert i think one egg serves two people i'm making a four egg pavlova and i'll separate out all the yolks just passing them gently between my hands until all the white slimes down through my fingers like i said save those we'll make our topping with them now beat these whites to soft peaks people say eggs need to be at room temperature they can't be cold when you whip the whites i think that's one of those rules that mattered back when people were whipping things by hand they whip a little slower when they're cold but i don't care because not for a million dollars would i make this dessert without an electric mixer there we go soft peaks just a couple of minutes now 50 grams of sugar per egg white i'm using powdered sugar and i am whipping it in a tiny bit at a time counter-intuitively this comes together way faster if you add the sugar very slowly you can dump it in all at once but then it takes a long time to whip it back to firm peaks a teeny bit at a time makes the job way faster yes i'm using powdered sugar lots of recipes say you can't use powdered sugar because it has a small amount of cornstarch in it to prevent clumping they tell you to use super fine sugar instead caster sugar which is hard to find in the states i did a side-by-side test with powdered sugar and a fine sugar that i made by running granulated sugar in the blender for 20 minutes both pavlovas came out the same and the one that i made with powdered sugar took way less time to mix ideally you want to mix the meringue until all the sugar is dissolved you can feel whether it's dissolved by just rubbing some meringue between your fingers if the sugar isn't dissolved the baked meringue is gonna weep or get little droplets of goo dripping off it you can make this with granulated sugar but to get it fully dissolved takes like a half an hour of mixing the powdered sugar dissolves almost instantly and when it's all in you can turn up the speed and beat this until you have stiff peaks which is still going to take a bit this took me another 10 minutes of whipping after i got the sugar in not stiff enough yet if it's not stiff the meringue won't hold its shape when you bake it it'll just melt and the inside won't be sufficiently aerated so it'll be dense and slimy not soft and pillowy those are some stiff peaks right there nice i'm sure it's possible to over beat this to the point where it would collapse but that would take a really long time this much sugar really stabilizes the foam though we can stabilize it further with some cornstarch i'm going to do half a teaspoon per egg white this makes the inside taste more like a marshmallow which i like too much will get you a meringue that is strong and keeps forever but tastes super chalky aka a cheap store-bought meringue another stabilizer is acid maybe half a teaspoon of lemon or lime juice per egg white this makes the meringue less likely to collapse in the oven and it tastes good we could have put it in at the beginning to prevent over whipping but that would have made the whipping take longer and the sugar made the overwhipping very unlikely anyway just mix those in along with a pinch of salt for taste some recipes tell you to dissolve that starch into the juice to make a slurry first i've tried that in a side-by-side test and it made no appreciable difference in the end this seems to whip in just fine as it is get a baking sheet line it with parchment the paper is totally essential here to prevent sticking some people trace a circle on it to guide them as they spread the meringue that is not a thing that i am going to do you can do all kinds of shapes and dimensions but the taller it is the more likely it is to collapse i think it's good to make a little well in the center for the filling and maybe a little fence around the rim to keep everything in really i just like spiky meringue don't worry there's no way those thin tips are gonna burn because we put this in the oven and then immediately reduce the heat to 215 fahrenheit 100c works good for me it gets an initial puff and then basically dries more than it cooks 90 minutes at very low temperature during which time you could watch a documentary on curiosity stream the sponsor of this video we're going to use a big splash of vanilla here in a second let's learn on curiosity stream how vanilla was first cultivated unlike other

while the pavlova is baking you can make this pastry cream which i would just eat in a bowl by itself it's pudding one tablespoon of granulated sugar per egg yolk and then a teaspoon of corn starch per egg yolk that's going to be a very thick paste at first but good the more viscous it is the easier it is to whisk out the lumps of corn starch if you don't have a tiny whisk a fork will do it got to be totally smooth now we're probably going to want like a quarter of a cup of water-based liquid per egg yolk 60 mls per yolk it could be water it could be white wine it could be milk cream i'm using evaporated milk which i really love it really smooths out the texture of things but i'm only measuring out three quarters of my expected amount i can always add i can't subtract and i want this thick dump that milk into a little saucepan on like medium-low heat and when it just starts to simmer whisk it directly into the egg yolk mixture tempering the eggs it's a fussy french technique that i've actually a b tested against just cooking things straight in the pan and i do think it helps prevent scrambled eggs speaking of which just keep whisking this constantly over real gentle heat like medium low we need to very slowly bring this up to a simmer if it's not thickening after a few minutes you could turn the heat up slightly but be careful because as soon as that cornstarch approaches the boiling point whoa whoa whoa turn that heat off and whisk like crazy i know that looks exactly like scrambled eggs but it's not scrambled eggs those are clumps of gelatinized starch not coagulated egg protein and you will be able to whisk them smooth see time to whisk in a tablespoon of butter per egg yolk half a stick in chunks so they melt a little bit faster the residual heat in the pan should be enough to do it you don't want to overheat the butter or the emulsion will break since i was conservative on my milk this is too viscous to whisk back into a liquid but we're on the knife's edge here watch what happens with just the addition of a big splash of vanilla that's enough to make this pudding again though by the time it chills it'll be way too thick to spread so i'll go ahead with the rest of my milk you can whisk in even more liquid later after it's chilled and get exactly the spreading consistency that you want the only thing you cannot do is thicken it back up again which is why i say start very thick cover that so that it doesn't develop a skin and chill now we just gotta wait for that meringue to be done when 90 minutes is up just turn off the heat and let it sit in there and dry for at least two hours ideally overnight it'll be more structurally sound the next day and the farty sulfur compounds in the eggs will off gas or break down or something you don't taste them as much the next day i had to shoot this on the same day that i baked it which is why this meringue was too delicate to peel off the paper that's fine just serve it on the paper i'll cut up my fruit topping right before i want to eat kiwi is of course the traditional favorite in australasia peel and then slice very thin i like kiwi for this because it's sour the meringue is super sweet so you eat it with tangy fruit and the two complete each other now pavlova is a very tricky dessert only if you demand that your meringues shall be totally uncracked when you eat it that's hard and judging by pictures on the internet people very rarely achieve uncracked perfection even if you do everything right there's variations with your oven or your eggs or your atmospheric conditions or the specific gravity of your topping that collapse actually never happened with my test bakes but hey if you don't want to risk it go with the traditional whipped cream it's lighter or you could fold pastry cream into whipped cream and get the best of both worlds these are raspberries by the way again i think soft sour fruits work best i really don't care about the collapse the meringue is going to start crumbling the instant you actually cut into it anyway it's possible to get a decent looking single slice like that but in general if you want really attractive single portions bake individual little pavlovas little plops of meringue on the baking sheet and no matter what size you do top the meringue right before you eat the topping will immediately start dissolving that cotton candy like crust i like how that pastry cream functions like a glue keeping all the parts together on their trip to your mouth which is right where they belong together

2017 United...",29:02.6, the other day i had a realization about why traditional recipes often require a bit of tweaking when you cook on the internet like i do every time you make something a little different from the way people have made it for generations you get the comments what do you think you're smarter than your grandma these recipes evolved over centuries you really think you know better and the answer is i think i know better about what kind of recipe will work for me and my life because my lifestyle is very very different than that of my ancestors if you have a device on which to watch this right now the same is probably true of you human life has never changed as rapidly as it has over the last century or so the tools that we have at our disposal the ingredients we have at our disposal and how we obtain them the time most of us spend working outside the home these things have all changed so much over the last few generations and they directly affect how we cook anyway i realized another one of these things recently another one of these things that explains why i cook differently than my grandma me and some extended family rented a condo on the beach as we do for a week every summer and when it was my night to cook i made spaghetti and meatballs always a crowd pleaser and without even thinking about it i found myself making it much closer to the way my grandma made it than the way that i usually make it you may have seen my old recipe video about this i usually make spaghetti and meatballs kind of the way you do swedish meatballs i make pretty small meatballs because i like to get more brown surface area proportionally on each one i usually don't use any egg in there i think egg is only necessary for binding big meatballs and when i'm done frying them in a pan i build my tomato sauce right there in the same pan it's a one pan operation deglaze stir stir stir constantly over pretty high heat and like 15 minutes after the tomatoes went in it's done when i was at the beach cooking for my in-laws the other day i used egg in the meat i formed it into absolutely giant meatballs i fried them in one pan and dropped them into my sauce in another pot and then i let the whole thing simmer for a couple hours just the way grandma origina did it and why because i was cooking for way more people than i usually do certain recipes and certain techniques work better for cooking at large quantities and certain things work better for cooking at small quantities and a few generations ago people often cooked in much larger quantities than we usually do today why because household sizes have absolutely plummeted at least here in highly developed countries like the united states and most of the places where you live according to my analytics we are simply living with fewer people under the same roof than our ancestors did this chart is from the pew research center average number of people per household according to u.s census data which is an amazing resource because it goes all the way back to the 18th century on average it used to be five or six people living under the same roof and cooking for each other every night now it's two or three people part of this of course is just people having fewer babies which seems to be an inevitable outcome of very high levels of economic development everywhere in the world where material prosperity rises and people have a lot of access to education and health care the birth rates plummet but in the us at least the decline in household size has outstripped even the decline in population growth if you normalized this pew chart for population growth rate household size would still show a decline over this period despite the fact that house size in the u.s has shot up like a rocket everywhere you go there's a corn field that somebody just littered with giant mcmansions in which hardly anybody lives like three or four people in one of these houses everybody gets a thousand square feet and of course it's not just the us here's a pretty recent united nations report quote average household size has declined almost everywhere these are just examples they have up here brazil france indonesia kenya but this trend has been going on in basically all but the very poorest countries and again decline in global birth rate is probably the biggest single factor but there are lots of other factors that are all intertwined with each other a rise in global material prosperity such that people just don't have to all be crammed in the same four walls anymore young people like most of you are delaying marriage and childbearing and living alone or maybe with one other person and when you cook you're cooking one or two portions instead of the five or six portions your great-grandparents are probably knocking out every night this is a very different cooking context for which i think the sponsor of this video is particularly well adapted hellofresh america's number

free meals thank you hellofresh anyway yeah household size has been plummeting nearly everywhere for decades really the only one trend kind of pushing in the opposite direction has been the number of young adults living at home with their parents that's actually been going up recently especially with kovid pew here attributes this to declining employment prospects for young adults but if you're an educated person likely to have a strong career the odds are good that you'll not only leave mom's basement at some point you're gonna leave mom's town there's a good chance you're gonna move away far away to take some fancy job in the ever more specialized ever more globalized economy just like i did and that affected the way that i cook i mean grandma ragusia's immediate household was small it was just a post-war nuclear family living in the new long island shoebox suburbs and yet she still cooked massive dinners pretty frequently because the whole extended italian family still lived around new york and they would get together regularly to eat here's my dad it would be in the basement 25 to 35 people with everybody sitting around a table that was partly a real table and partly plywood on saw horses and everybody would be screaming at one another and arguing about politics and then it would all just sort of disappear as soon as the food hit the table hey frank pass me the meatballs come on get them over here it makes me really sad how few experiences like that i've had in my life dad went to grad school and moved far away from the extended family i went to grad school and moved far away from the extended family there's still times when i get together with aunts and uncles and cousins and nieces and nephews and we have a big dinner around a big table but that's like a once a year occurrence not a once a week occurrence still like i said at the beginning once a year we get together with my wife's side of the family and we do a big beach week and that's where i made spaghetti and meatballs for everybody not the way i usually make it but the way my grandma would have made it sure i think small meatballs generally taste better because they have proportionally more brown surface area but as i was shaping these i kept making them bigger and bigger because shaping and then browning enough tiny meatballs for a house full of people would have been way more work you only have so much surface area in your pan and tall meatballs pack more meat into that fixed area i got this all browned off in two batches the same weight of small meatballs probably would have taken four batches and instead of building my sauce right in the same pan like i usually do i did it over here in another pot just like grandma would have done why well again household sizes have changed a lot in recent decades but burner size and pot surface area have stayed about the same to cook down tomato sauce for 8 or 10 people in a 10 or 12 inch wide pot takes hours to cook down sauce for one or two people takes minutes this takes hours so i got the sauce going before i even started working on my meatballs it was just more time efficient that way to have it bubbling along in the background while i worked on the meat and when i got done browning all my meatballs in this pan i kind of didn't want to dissolve all of that fond and everything else in there into my sauce like i normally do these two batches of giant meatballs took a long time to fry off so that pan is full of little bits of onion and stuff that fell out and got burned i am very happy to leave all of that behind so i did what grandma did lifted the meatballs out and plopped them over here in the sauce in a different pot and since they were so big they did real well just braising in that sauce for hours they got cooked all the way through and they didn't get overcooked because i simmered this at a pretty low temperature when i do my small meatballs for two or three people i use high heat and stir aggressively the whole time to keep anything from burning on the bottom it's a bit of effort but again it's done in 15 minutes so who cares if i wanted to cook this giant pot of sauce and meatballs on high heat it would take a lot more physical effort to stir it and keep everything turning over on itself fast enough to ensure that nothing burns on the bottom and i would have to do that for way longer than 15 minutes it's much easier to just leave that giant pot on a low simmer and let it sit there mostly unattended for a couple of hours and i was able to watch it for a couple hours because it was vacation and i didn't have to go to work back in the olden days when households were huge you were more likely to have at least one person under your roof who wasn't working outside the home probably mom she was working in here all day long and as a result she was able to keep her eye on a low simmering pot for many many hours it was simply the case that those kind of long simmering dishes were more feasible for someone working at home in that context anyway my point is no i don't think i'm smarter than her i think that i'm just living in very different times may we all cook for the times that are given to us not someone else's

sensodyne here's some steps for converting nearly any cookie recipe that you like into homemade ice cream sandwiches i'm just starting from my own chocolate chip cookie recipe or rather i'm making a half batch with the extra bulk of the ice cream you really only need a half batch a stick of butter fully melted 4 ounces 113 grams 200 grams 1 cup of brown sugar or a cup of white sugar topped off with a glug of molasses because that's all brown sugar is big splash of vanilla and i'm doing a heaps teaspoon of kosher salt like six grams try extra salt in your cookie recipe salty cookies with ice cream is a life-changing combination one egg beat that smooth to where you get those nice ribbons then i'll prepare my dry ingredients and my chunks i've got about six ounces 170 grams of mixed white and dark chocolate chips before i put these in i want to chop them into smaller chunks that won't hurt my teeth when they're hard and cold basically my whole adult life i've had really temperature sensitive teeth which is a drag when eating and drinking and cooking is kind of your whole thing you just get these little flashes of pain when you eat very cold or hot things as a result the prospect of diving front teeth first into an ice cream sandwich can be a little daunting the pleasure but the pain but the pleasure so i'm brushing with sensodyne specifically sensodyne rapid relief you brush with this twice a day and in as little as three days you can get some relief from those painful little twinges i totally feel the effect and it's awesome i no longer fear you sir sunday is national ice cream day here in the states so gear up for it life is too short for sensitive teeth use sensodyne and go back to enjoying ice cream without the pain of sensitivity thank you sensodyne now i'm putting in a teaspoon of baking powder that's a little extra leavening it'll help lighten the texture when this cookie is hard and cold and flour starting with just a cup of all-purpose flour 120 grams that's less than i normally put in i want this dough to be really wet and sticky so it'll spread nice and thin in the oven i hate ice cream sandwiches that are so thick you dislocate your jaw trying to eat them that's too sticky a little more flour and yeah that's good go for a texture that's noticeably wetter and stickier than how your recipe normally feels in goes my chopped up chocolate chunks and then i would normally chill this dough so that it doesn't spread too fast and too far in the oven but for a sandwich i want it to spread as thin as possible so straight this goes into a parchment-lined baking sheet gotta have excess parchment on each side so we can lift the cookie sheet out after it's baked and it helps to spray the metal with non-stick ironically so that the paper will stick to it a little bit and lie flat you can also make it lie flatter by making diagonal cuts of the corners that allows the excess of the corner to overlap like that and any excess that's going to curl into the cookie you can just trim off time to drop the dough in dollops if you space out the dollops you reduce the distance over which you will now have to spread this very sticky viscous substance nice gentle pulling strokes with the back of the spatula i find it helps to think of it as painting the cookie dough as thin as you can get it if it looks like you don't have enough to cover the whole pan i'd recommend working it all the way to one edge one side at least you'll get nice clean edges on that side the other side we can trim later okay in the oven you go with your normal temperature this is 375 fahrenheit 135c and i would lean on the side of it being under baked that'll make it softer and easier to cut into sandwiches without shattering it that was only like five minutes in there and while it's still hot and pliable lift the sheet out of the pan see no breaking no cracking because it's still soft now you can let it cool all the way down and solidify it's fully cooled now first thing is to cut it in half the top and bottom sheets i'll follow the natural diagonal bent that it came out with and then i'm going to need to lift the top sheet off the paper so i'm just sliding under it with my knife to pry it off once it's dislodged i'm going to use my scissors to cut the parchment in half i can use the paper to lift up the top sheet later take your ice cream out a little in advance and it's a spreadable texture when you can just pinch the carton kind of like that drop on scoops of whatever flavor you want i'm alternating chocolate and vanilla scoops when they're pressed together these will give me a nice kind of marbled effect i love doing this with cookie sheets instead of individual cookie pears because i can do it so much faster and speed matters when the ice cream is melting rapidly two full pints of ice cream will fit between these sheets that's almost a liter then very carefully i'll lift up the top sheet by its paper turn it out onto my hand i need it to be upside down so that now i can reverse it and plop it right down onto the ice cream top side up once there it's time to very gently push compress that ice cream and close all the gaps between the scoops if the ice cream isn't soft enough just let it sit there for a minute and try again you should see it start to squeeze out the sides like well toothpaste now real quick that whole sheet has to go in the freezer to chill solid once it's totally firm you can safely cut it up into sandwiches which you could do with or without cleaning up the edges first trimming off any uneven sides trimming is a little wasteful but personally i've never hesitated to lay so great a sacrifice at the altar of aesthetics anyway when it's time to actually cut these into squares i find i get much cleaner cuts if i saw with my knife a little bit at first just until the knife has bitten down through the really brittle cookie surface once you've done that you can push straight down without much risk of cracking you could individually wrap these in plastic but i'm doing little sheets of parchment paper you might have noticed i didn't flip the bottom cookie sheet before i stacked it with ice cream you could do that but i like for the bottom of the sandwich to be the bottom of the cookie sheet it gives you some textural contrast with the smooth shiny top sadly i do think it's best to chill these one more time before you eat them if the ice cream isn't really cold the jaw force necessary to bite through the cookie will cause the ice cream to squeeze out the sides like well toothpaste thanks again to sensodyne for sponsoring this video brush with that and get to enjoying an ice cream summer the way it was meant to be enjoyed

Sign up here https://cen.yt/mbadamragusea7 for your free daily newsletter — I’ve really enjoyed Morning Brew and I think you will too!...,29:02.6, so i was playing around with my buttermilk biscuits technique trying to make it more efficient and get better layering and i stumbled onto this funny variation i'm calling fall over biscuits first thing is get the oven real hot 450 fahrenheit or 475 is what i'm doing almost 250c we need high heat to generate steam for puffiness super simple dough start with a cup of all-purpose flour 120 grams into a bowl that should feel a little too big for the job that will make cutting the butter in a lot easier later a teaspoon of sugar just makes the flavor taste a little more alive and helps with browning if i'm using unsalted butter half a teaspoon of morton kosher is a good amount of salt for me with salted butter i would just add a tiny pinch baking powder i do like a heaped teaspoon on that butter better butter tastes better in biscuits because there's lots of it proportionally two ounces have a stick almost 60 grams very cold right out of the fridge that's important i don't know why i slept on pastry cutters for so long these things cost like six bucks it's as fast as the food processor if you include setup it's tiny and it's way easier to clean you could use a knife to chop the butter into the flour instead or press a fork into it but this just does the best job and it does it quickly which is important because if the butter melts you end up with a tough homogeneous mixture that will not be as flaky or crumbly i think you want to cut the butter into chunks that are little but still clearly visible lots of butter in this recipe for the non-us crowd american biscuits are like scones but they're softer and richer and flakier at this point it's virtually a pie crust recipe but now we add a lot of moisture u.s style buttermilk fermented milk if you can't get this i would mix yogurt with milk or water until you get viscosity like that measure out half a cup 120 mls and then i'm pouring in most of it but keeping just a little bit behind for later mix that with a spoon as much as the spoon can do the dough should feel pretty wet the moisture will give us the steam we need for a lift time to flour my hand a little scrape off what's left on the spoon and knead that just barely just until it comes together into a ball no more too much kneading and it'll be tough throw that on a cutting board a big dusting of flour everywhere and then flatten it out into about half an inch or a centimeter i used to use a rolling pin for this but lately i've just been using my hands the hands seem to do just as good a job and they actually give you more control i want to shape this into as close to a rectangle as i reasonably can and then the first fold i gotta be sure to count same deal again smash it down to half an inch trying to keep it as rectangular as possible i'm flipping it there to make sure that the side i'm about to fold over on itself is well flowered the dry flower between the layers is what gives you nice clear distinct layers in the final product nice tidy rectangle top is well flowered fold over that's three folds keep going the more we can keep this rectangular the less trimming waste we'll have at the end i'm going for zero waste because i'm only making enough for four small biscuits here biscuits are only really good when they're very fresh so i see no point in making more than you can eat at a time just make as many as you and yours want with your morning brew that day your coffee and your

stock summary with a few lines explaining the numbers then quick bullet point summaries of important stories that are helpful for me to skim before i start my day the writing is easily skimmed it's funny and it's interesting if you're into business finance and tech there's no reason to not subscribe to morningbrew it's free and takes two seconds to sign up for do us both a favor and sign up via my link in the description thank you morning brew we are approaching the magic number of folds which is seven i am hardly the first person to observe that seven is perfect you could do six but i would not do eight because the number of layers doubles with each fold the difference between seven and eight folds is really big and with eight folds the layers are so numerous and thin that they cease to be perceivable as layers seven folds is the upper limit with this kind of dough and for the seventh and final fold i'm going to dip into that little bit of buttermilk i have left and paint that onto the surface because we don't mash this down very hard after the final fold that middle seam has a tendency to not seal the biscuit just splits in two as it puffs in the oven the buttermilk will serve as glue and then we don't smash that out very much it should be an inch or a couple of centimeters tall nice tidy rectangle back in the bowl and in the freezer to chill for like 10 minutes if you chill the dough it is so much easier to cut and you get much cleaner layers you could use the traditional circular biscuit cutter but that gets you a lot of trimming waste squares are much more efficient and you can trim off a little on the sides if you want really clean edges that all show the layers but i don't care that much i am however going to cut this into triangles rather than squares i like triangles because they give you dry corners that contrast with the moist interior and the narrowness of the triangle shape is essential to the fall over effect i'm going to show you a sawing motion with my knife gets me cleaner cuts chill your dough gently saw it and look the layers are visible we've not smashed them into each other and blurred the lines and you could bake them just like that or you could brush the tops with melted butter or you could glaze the tops with that bit of buttermilk you have left this gets you a kind of shiny effect in those go to the very hot oven i'm not using my convection fan i find the fan gets the edges too brown before the inside can puff up all the way let them puff let them puff then five minutes in there it goes too tall and narrow to stay upright when this first happened to me i regarded it as a mistake but no longer you'll see why these took just 15 minutes total you don't want to get the edges too brown any browner than that on biscuits tastes burned if anything i baked these a hair too long so there's the top facing side nice clear laminations pale gold color flip it around to the side it toppled over on and over here you got deep golden croissant-like effect fall over biscuits two tastes in one the fact that they tumble a third of the way through baking ensures the brown sides won't get too hot and burn love it look the biscuits literally say it's not a shape that's good for splitting and making a biscuit sandwich with do squares for that but the way i like to eat biscuits is just pull them apart along their layers and summon forth the upside down bear good morning sir thank you for donating your delicious brains to my biscuits

To make a milkshake:...",29:02.6, that's a shade that's milk and ice cream you know if you were smart as you thought you were vincent you wouldn't have got got i'm here to argue there's three essential ingredients to a good milkshake milk ice cream and syrup or something else that functions like a syrup the syrup helps a ton texturally as well as tastually it could just be simple syrup equal parts granulated sugar and water by weight or volume their ballpark same density bring to a boil keep it there a minute max pour it off let it cool milkshakes come out way better when everything is cold all your ingredients and your tools i'll show you the best vessel i've found for blending milkshakes in at home a big mason jar one quart about a liter chilled in the freezer and i'd pull the ice cream out at the last second i'm using sweet cream ice cream which is just plain no vanilla no nothing it gives me a blank canvas it's from this beloved local dairy here in knoxville tennessee look at that natural caramel color just from the milk fat and the eggs i'm scooping in half the pint that's two to fifty mils and instead of plain milk i'm reaching for evaporated milk i love this stuff i use it all the time in a shake it does the exact same thing as regular milk plus a spoon of milk powder which is a trick that a lot of people use it just makes a stronger milk flavor and a smoother texture from the casein protein really just a quarter cup to start with 60 mls or something big lug of vanilla since there's none in the ice cream the expensive stuff does usually taste better and then like a spoon or two of simple syrup without the syrup a milkshake is either under sweet or over thick depending on the milk content and hey just for fun let's do it i'll go butterfingers let's do an oreo maybe two now you could blend this in any big narrow thing the mason jar is just the best thing in my house as long as i've chilled it glass is pretty thermally conductive it'll melt your ice cream if it's not cold same as metal and i love doing this with a stick blender instead of a countertop style blender the immersion blender is smaller it's cheaper it's easier to clean it gives you more control you can reach into corners where the ice cream isn't getting mixed and you can feel the texture with a little experience you can feel through the blender if you need more milk to get this into a drinkable texture there's no point in making a milkshake if you're gonna put it into a thermally conductive cup that is not chilled it'll melt in 30 seconds if the glass is not frosty but right now that's too thick to suck up with a straw which is how milkshakes usually are when i buy them out these days maybe restaurants do that because they think proportionally more ice cream equals more quality maybe it's because they think it's under sweet if you do too much milk but that's what the syrup fix is and i say there's no point in milkshakes if you can't drink them otherwise it's just ice cream served with the wrong utensil and you can easily add more milk or syrup or whatever it needs right there in the glass so be conservative up front and you can't lose maybe they put in too much ice cream because it's colder that way and that gives them more time to serve it before it melts but the frosty glass protects us just as the sponsor of this video protects us surf shark let me thank them hey that's me the little s up there is the frosty glass of the internet before you do anything on your computer or your phone just log in through one of

percent off thank you surf shark now right here is another key to a better milkshake experience at home a small cocktail glass high ball rocks glass old-fashioned glass this one is eight ounces to the brim these chill great because they're so thick and they're small which means you can fill it to the brim with a reasonable portion of milkshake two scoops of ice cream is perfect for that glass like a quarter of the pint splash of evaporated milk to start with and instead of making syrup you could summon forth the upside down bear it's a ready-made syrup and an underrated flavor pairing with ice cream also goes great with berries the last of the blackberries from my vine there's a lot of squirrels with purple paws running around here i see you not only is this big mason jar the perfect dimensions but that tapered lip at the top works as a splatter guard and because this is headed into a merely eight ounce glass we can fill it all the way to the top which looks a lot nicer to fill the pint glass all the way up you need almost a pint of ice cream restaurants use the whole pint that's why they give you the little bit of excess in the mixing vessel next to your glass i don't need to drink a whole pint of ice cream but i do need that dollop of real whipped cream just cold cream in a bowl whip until you get stiff-ish peaks a little vanilla and sugar delicious it's popular on milkshakes because it provides heterogeneity to an otherwise homogeneous dessert that tastes great but strongly of honey i don't want that honey taste every day so let's go back to syrup and simple syrup is a very easy way of extracting flavor out of other things like plant parts my new place has like endless beds of mint for some reason to use it in something but leaves and such you want to put in after the syrup has pretty much stopped bubbling if you stir them in when it's still really boiling the syrup will be brown and taste cooked not fresh as this will as soon as i strain that out and chill it i want a lot of mint flavor in there so that i don't have to add too much sweetness proportionately to my ice cream big splash of evaporated milk and nobody has to know if we sneak in a little green food coloring splash of vanilla really complements mint it softens it and chocolate chips now because i need them to get pulverized with everything else the chocolate bits have to be small enough to pass through a straw otherwise it's not a drink i just got this shake from a hipster burger place with chunks of cookie dough so big that they couldn't pass through the double wide straw they served it with that's not a drink this is a drink loose enough that i can sip it through a normal compostable straw how about a chocolate syrup instead the benefit of making it yourself is you can use much higher quality cocoa powder and you can put in way more of it this is equal parts sugar water and cocoa by volume i like to let the cocoa actually boil for a few seconds that deepens the flavor off the heat and this is a job for a tiny whisk it takes some stirring but it's amazing how much cocoa you can fit in there and when you chill it it has this amazing gooey ganache like texture you could frost a cake with that it's great in the milkshake or on it or both an alternative to making a flavored syrup is to sweeten your shake with a big spoonful of fruit preserve any kind this is marmalade for you brits couple of scoops of ice cream splash of evaporated milk buzz buzz buzz and well nobody has to know red plus yellow equals orange right hey this time let's plop some cream in the bottom of the glass shake on top and another dollop of cream in the top this has got an upscale creamsicle thing going on that i really like but this whole video people from the new england region of the united states have been screaming that's not a shake that's a frap a shake with syrup is a frap and it's our thing well here's something that should make you happy marshmallow fluff from summerville mass you want to make a new england deer cry make them a fluffernutter sandwich marshmallow cream and peanut butter on white bread they all grew up with it and we can use the fluff in place of syrup get in there you big spoonful of peanut butter too a couple of scoops of ice cream and we'll probably need a little extra milk to counteract the thickening power of those mix-ins can you make milkshakes without a power tool i don't think so you have to warm the ice cream too much to make it whiskable it's just a glass of melted ice cream at the end there's a reason the milkshake popularized when and where it did early 20th century us only the new electrical blenders could get you something so smooth and frosty and cold and i love how the cold here has made the little bits of marshmallow go firm they're small enough to go up your straw but they still chew a little like marshmallows and i guess a fluffernutter is supposed to have bread so mini nilla wafers that one might not look pretty but it's totally the one i'm gonna make again for myself when you're not looking

southern icebox dessert no actual cooking involved if you use canned blueberry pie filling i'll show you how to make it from scratch if you want but in brenda's house we do it her way my friend brenda savattawa is famous for her blueberry yum yum today she's showing her son chris how to do it and we get to learn too step one melt a stick and a half of butter that's six ounces 170 grams and while i'm melting that why don't you go ahead and measure three cups of graham cracker crumbs she's using the pre-pulverized crumbs but you could get the same quantity by smashing about 20 of those big rectangular graham crackers like 250 grams if you smash them yourself you can get a coarser consistency that i usually prefer but again brenda's house i use it because it's easy easy sweeten those up with a quarter cup of sugar 50 grams then pour in all the melted butter all right mix that up good this is maybe a little more butter than you'd normally use to bind a graham cracker pie crust but remember we're not baking this so we're not going to rely on the starch and sugar to set into a structural matrix we're simply relying on the butter to congeal in the fridge and hold this stuff solid it'll look like wet sand at this stage then you just set aside one big scoop of it maybe a third of a cup for later put it in here okay this is for your top for the topping this is for your sprinkle top then the bulk of those crumbs go into the dish he's got like a 9 by 13 inch dish there but again because there's no baking you don't have to worry about like oh if my dish is too small then the surface to mass ratio will be too low and the outside will burn before the inside is cooked it's just going in the fridge it can be any dimension you could do little individual ones the one thing you probably want to be sure to do is press the crumb into the dish this will make it set solid and here's part of the reason why you want it to be really pat down hard is because when you get ready to spread that whipped cream on there when you're spreading on loose things you're going to get all that crumble so make sure it's nice see how that is right there to that end the dish with the crust in it goes into the fridge to chill while we get the other layers ready open up two eight-ounce blocks of cream cheese one pound 453 grams you know the the hardest part of this recipe is remembering to keep your cream cheese out to soften cream cheese is often packaged in aluminum foil to prevent oxidation and you can't put metal in the microwave you could unwrap it and nuke it at very low power to soften it it just has to be soft so you can beat in one cup of sugar 200 grams just until smooth that looks pretty good does that look good yeah here we need to um get your little spatula and scoop down the sides and push them in the middle time now for the whipped cream brenda has a chilled bowl in the freezer cream whips faster if it's really cold i think that matters a lot more if you're whipping it by hand with a whisk two cups of cream a pint half a liter plus a quarter cup of powdered sugar 40 grams maybe you can use granulated sugar but powdered grains are less sharp less likely to pop your bubbles and the little bit of starch and powdered sugar helps stabilize the foam okay so that's not a soft peak that's still liquidy and give it another minute the problem with whipped cream is that if you take it too far all of a sudden it bunches up and gets a texture like cottage cheese it still tastes okay but it doesn't look pretty so brenda just takes it to very conservative soft peaks because there's still more whipping to come she drops in the cream cheese mixture just a little bit you don't want big old globs just smaller gloves she's just trying to get this integrated while deflating the foam as little as possible so first she kind of folds the globs into the cream with a spatula and then back in with the beater for just a brief minute we're going to ensure that everything is mixed up together because we don't want to beat the whipped cream down and there you go nice and smooth though the detached beater has attracted the attention of a third generation in the room is it yum here take the whole thing now the chilled crust comes out of the fridge and you drop about half the cream mixture down in dollops you want to be able to spread it to a thin layer with as few strokes as possible if you're too rough with the spatula you're going to get all these crumbles up in the in the middle of the mixture you don't it'll eventually get in the mixture it'll all be mixed in in my belly time now for the blueberries two 21 ounce cans of blueberry pie filling a little over a kilo total you can make it yourself but this is a recipe for people living in the real world the kind of people for whom the sponsor of this video is a big help hellofresh let me thank them for a sec hellofresh is america's number one meal kit and i love it me a guy who kind of

free shipping my link and code are in the description 12 free meals with my code adamergucia12 thank you hellofresh now if you did want to make your pie filling yourself maybe because you have fresh picked blueberries here's how i would do it like three pints of blueberries in a pot about a kilo dump in a cup of sugar 200 grams heat on high and if you stir this the heat and the sugar will break these down but you can accelerate the process by mashing them a bit that's just a potato masher bring everything to a boil and cook until the berries have just started to break apart and kind of visibly melt into that solution i still think you want big chunks to thicken this you'd want at least a quarter cup of starch at least 30 grams maybe twice as much if you want a really solid set consistency and i'm just dissolving it in the minimum amount of water necessary when it's a thick slurry like this it's very easy to break up any remaining lumps with your finger or just by shaking it real hard then you gotta stir constantly as you drizzle it into the boiling liquid if you just dump it in you'll get this giant glob of starch gel that you can't dissolve it should visibly thicken right away but it'll thicken more as it cools for me blueberry yum yum is better if there's a little more acidity in the fruit to cut the richness so i'm juicing in some lemon to taste the acid will break down the cornstarch a bit as this sits in the fridge over time if that bothers you if you really want that very firm consistency plus a lot of acidity i'd go with a pie thickener like clear gel that's a modified starch that you can buy i might also play with some spices christmasy spices like cloves and cinnamon go great with blueberries and here's how it looks after it's chilled you want to spread it on the yum yum when it's chilled but again brenda's house brenda's rules two cans okay so you're going to spread it all the way yep then it's time to drop on the rest of the cream and this can be tricky to do without smearing the layers together when you glob it you want to glob and roll kind of like a glove and blob and roll okay just keep a little bit in that bowl like that because you might need it for to fix your errors with this kind of thing i find it always helps to just kind of pull with the spatula in one direction swipe the cream over you see what i said about keep a little bit to fix your i guess it doesn't really matter because once you put graham crackers on yeah these will make just about anything look pretty that's the scoop of crust that we reserved from before dust that on and then all three generations were kind enough to plop on those fresh blueberries that i picked but you could put any fruit on there maybe something more acidic to balance the sweet canned filling and you could eat that right now but the layers would not hold together at all it would scoop into a homogeneous blob chill it for a few hours and it'll scoop real clean like that and our family is the edge we have those that won't just want the crust others that want the blueberries and others so you know we got we can make everybody happy you know we grew up very poor you know food stamps and um commodity food commodity foods the word commodity in this context means these giant generic processed foods that the us government buys to subsidize agribusinesses and then turns around and gives to people on food assistance so when you're when you're poorer you know you had to work with what you had with commodities and food stamps and this is one of those like it looks

it might be easier to make fresh pasta with just a rolling pin and your counter — no
pasta rolling machine to get out and assemble and clean. I'm gonna show you how I do it
and then we'll make a super quick and delicious creamy mushroom sauce for it. You can mix your pasta dough in a bowlm but
since we're gonna get the counter dirty anyway when we roll this out, I'ma just do everything
right here. A cup of flour, 120g to start with. And one egg per portion is a good rule
of thumb. I'm making two. Carve a little well in the center of the flour pile and crack
them in. To me, the biggest reason to make my own pasta
is to make egg pasta. Fresh egg pasta is a totally different taste and texture from anything
else and it's so good. Half teaspoon of Morton kosher. I increasingly think fresh pasta comes
out better if you season the dough directly, at least little bit — rather than just relying
on salty boil water. With my fork I'll get those eggs beaten and
mixed into the flour as much as possible before I have no choice but to get in with my hands.
Knead and knead and knead. It always feel like it's never gonna come together until
it does. Keep the faith. Once it is together, but it becomes too sticky to work, I'll dust
on more flour. With pasta, you generally just knead in however
much flour the dough can take. And my basic technique is to gather up my dough, put my
palm on the ball and then lean into it with my bodyweight. Gather the dough back up into
a ball and repeat. Very physically efficient — requires hardly any strength because your
weight and gravity are providing the force. After a good 8 minutes of kneading my dough
is pretty smooth and elastic, it's hardly sticky at all anymore and it's therefore not
taking much more flour. We're pretty much done. I am using the dough as a broom of sorts
to grab up any flakes of dough that are stuck to the counter. If we don't get those off,
they'll dry and then flake off and stick to the dough later as we roll it out here, and
they won't fully rehydrate then so then they'll mess with the texture. Just use the dough
to scrub the counter clean. There we go, barely sticky. That'll be easy
to roll out by hand, but you still want to cover it with a damp towel or something and
let it rest at least 15 minutes or so. It rolls out easier after it rests a bit. While we wait we can prep everything else.
I'll peel and chop a few garlic cloves — you can't beat the combination of garlic and mushrooms.
I've got a pint of cremini mushrooms — that's 4 oz, 113g. Just about any mushroom variety
would be fine. I'll trim any particularly woody stem ends off and then slice. No need
to get them paper thin. They'll shrink a lot when they cook and I like them to have some
texture. Now we'll need a little pot of water for boiling.
I'll give that a pinch of salt too just cover my bases. Heat on high. And for the mushroom
sauce I'll use my high-carbon steel pan from the sponsor of this video, Misen. Let me thank
them real quick. Misen makes shockingly robust cookware given
their entry-level prices. Every pan I have from them is way more solid and hefty than
any comparably priced stuff that I've handled. This is how my carbon steel pan arrived. I
just melted off the packing wax and then you season the pan just like cast iron. Unlike
other oils, this seasoning wax that comes with the pan actually smells good as you polymerize
it into a naturally nonstick coating. Just follow the directions. High-carbon steel holds
onto that seasoning much in the way cast iron does, but you also get the superior thermal
conductivity of steel. It heats up a lot faster and more evenly, and check out that removably
rubber handle. Like medium-high heat, a good coating of olive oil and this pan is great
for mushrooms, which tend to stick to pans the same way meat does. They brown great in
that Misen pan. Hit my link in the description, use promo
code ragusea and get yourself 20% off your first order from Misen — on this pan or
anything. Use my link, enter code ragusea at at checkout, save 20%. Thank you, Misen. Now, this could be enough mushrooms for two
portions, but I like a lot of mushrooms and I like to cook them down a lot to concentrate
their flavor. So I'ma put in another pint. This one is pre-sliced — that's fine as
long they're fresh. Hey there's some yellow oyster mushrooms in there too. I'll just stir continuously, at least for
the early phase, until I've built some brown crust on these and a lot of water stars to
come out. Once the pan is water wet like that, it's safe to let them go unattended for a
moment while we get our pasta ready. A big handful of flour to keep it from sticking
as we roll, and roll we shall. I basically do this the way I do pastry. Roll at little
and then turn it. Roll, turn. Turning it or even flipping it helps you make sure every
surface is getting a fresh dusting of flour and nothing is sticking. Plus turning helps
you roll more evenly in all directions. You can be much rougher with this than you are
with pastry, though. Don't be delicate. Really dig in there with the corner of the pin. I'll pause to stir my mushrooms, and if you
feel like they're getting out ahead of you, just take the pan off the heat. Mushrooms
can wait for a long time without anything bad happening to them. You may be wondering: Without a rolling machine,
how do roll it to even thickness? How do I know how thin to make it? Well, the good news
is you don't have to worry about that, because it's nearly impossible to get this very, very
thin with a rolling pin. Just get all of it as thin as you physically can, and everything
will be pretty even and it definitely won't be too thin. The bad news is your noodles
are probably gonna be a little thick, a little rustic. But if we play our cards right, they'll
be satisfyingly thick. Thicc, with two Cs. I'll make sure that's well-floured and not
sticky before I fold it up a few times and throw it on a cutting board. I find a sawing
motion works better than straight downward pressure. If you just push down, it tends
to crush the layers together more and make them stick to each other. I'm going for tagliatelle-type
width on these, keeping in mind they're gonna swell like 50% when they cook. Once cut, you either need drape them over
something, like a drying rack where they can hold for awhile without sticking to each other,
or you can just toss them around in a little flour to get them unraveled and then cook
them within a few minutes. Once they're in a pile like that, you're committed and you
gotta cook them soon before they stick. This is why I got my mushrooms going in advance. They're back on the heat now and looking cooked,
so I'll throw in my garlic and let it just barely cook for a minute before deglazing
with ... fine Scotch whiskey. It might seem weird, but I think barrel-aged spirits go
amazing with mushrooms and/or cream, even with otherwise-Italian flavors. Sometime I
use brandy, sometimes I use bourbon. You could totally deglaze with a splash of water instead
— this just gives the sauce some extra depth. Then just enough cream to just cover the mushrooms.
Once that's in, the timing should work out perfect if we drop the pasta now. Give it
a stir to make sure the noodles aren't sticking to the pan or each other. Fresh pasta cooks
in like two minutes. Stir that simmering cream, meanwhile. And give it a conservative seasoning.
We can add more salt at the end to taste. And just when the pasta seems to have swollen
a bit and go noticeably more buoyant, it's done. If anything, I want to undercook this
a bit before it goes in the sauce. And pasta water is the other main component
of the sauce. You could catch some in cup as you drain — I'm simply gonna not drain
this very thoroughly and have faith the proportions are gonna work out. There's tons of wiggle
room here. Toss that around, get everything combined. I think it's gonna need more moisture. That
sauce texture might look perfect now, but it's gonna thicken a ton by the time it cools
on the plate and we actually start eating. I'ma loosen it with some more Scotch, but
water would be fine. More cream would do it, as long as it doesn't get cooked very much. You could finish now with some fresh herb.
Tarragon would go with these flavors. Parsley would be nice. But today I'm gonna do an alternative to finishing
with herbs. I'm gonna dump in a really big handful of arugula. Any delicate salad green
that you have leftover in the fridge could work — watercress, baby spinach. And it
will fit in two seconds if you can just get it worked into the pan a little. It will wilt
down almost instantly. Finishing pasta with tender greens gets you
vibrant color and freshness without all the powerful aromas of herbs. If you want to the
other flavors of your dish to ring clear, this works great. I want to taste the mushrooms
and the whiskey today. Taste for salt content, add more if needed and you're done. Look at how much that sauce has tightened
in just the last few seconds — I could have put in even more moisture. Because these are rough, hand-rolled noodles
their texture is on the verge dumping consistency, but I love that and it works great with the
mushrooms. The whole dish is satisfyingly toothsome. Not something you wanna eat every
day, this heap of carbs and dairy fat and booze. I'm gonna have some regrets later,
but at the moment I'm a happy man."

***BASE RECIPE, MAKES ~30 BISCOTTI***

1 stick...",29:02.6, biscotti are twice baked cookies very crunchy very dry very dippable i love them but sometimes i think they can be just jaw shattering so i've tried to get a dough recipe here that's a little more tender a little more delicate and it works as a flavor neutral base you can mix it up divide it and then bake a few different flavors all at once step one is to soften a stick of butter either by leaving it out or microwaving it on low power 10 or 15 seconds at a time nuke rotate nuke rotate very carefully until it's soft not melted that's four ounces 113 grams then one and one-third cups of sugar about 270 grams in that big mixing bowl i will cream the butter and the sugar as best i can the sugar quantity is kind of high for this you might not get the butter looking super fluffy but you're still definitely cutting little air bubbles into the fat that'll make the texture lighter at the end the purportedly original biscotti recipe from tuscany has no fat at all in it do that if you want but the butter is what gets you more of a shortbread taste and texture i think literally every english language recipe i've seen has fat in it like any other cookie i'm gonna crack in three eggs you could divide this whole recipe by three if you wanted a smaller batch and while almond is the traditional flavoring i'm gonna put a little splash of vanilla in at this stage we'll do the almond flavor later get that beaten really smooth to the point where you can see it making ribbons like that again this will lighten the texture at the end i used unsalted butter today so i'm putting in half a teaspoon of morton kosher about three grams that'll make these just a little noticeably salty which i want a scant half teaspoon of baking powder a couple of grams again the traditional recipe has no leavening at all and three cups of flour to start with 360 grams we're gonna add more this is just the baseline get all that mixed in and smooth at this point it's about as wet and sticky as a typical cookie dough for biscotti i think you'd traditionally mix in enough flour to where it's barely wet or sticky at all i'm going for a happy medium i think i ended up putting in almost a whole additional cup so maybe 470 480 grams total four cups there's a lot of wiggle room here i like it when it's dry enough that it doesn't stick to you when you smash it like that but it does still feel wet that's our base dough that's going to be moist enough to be tender but still dry enough to absorb your morning brew which you could enjoy whilst reading morning brew the sponsor of

link in the description it's completely free and takes less than 15 seconds to sign up there's no reason to not subscribe to morning brew if you're interested in business finance or tech follow my link in the description thank you morning brew now i'll get a couple of smaller bowls and divide this dough roughly into thirds for three different flavors chocolate chips are nice but so are butterscotch chips maybe a quarter cup of those and an equal quantity of say pecans i think nuts work much better in biscotti than they do in softer cookies i threw an extra dose of vanilla in there and i'll mix that up it's great to do multi-flavor biscotti when you have tons of little half bags of random chunkies left over from previous baking adventures this will be my almond one white chocolate chips are very nice with almonds whole ore slivered whatever and here's my almond extract much stronger than vanilla extract so be careful though i'm still liking a big splash just for fun let's color this in the logic of sweets almond is sometimes green just as raspberry is sometimes blue lord knows why put in a little more color than you think you want because it's going to lighten a bit as it bakes at this point we've added enough moisture that i think i want to mix in a little extra flour if i don't roughly match the texture of the other dough this one will spread more in the oven and maybe over bake done i'll wipe off the beaters a bit but i'm deliberately mixing these in ascending order of darkness so that i don't really have to worry about color pollution you won't see the green through the brown a couple of tablespoons of dutch cocoa like 15 grams and i'm gonna balance that with an extra pinch of sugar and a little glug of oil this counters the coco's drying effect then let's play some more peanut butter chips and i've got some whole macadamia nuts i deliberately did the chocolate dough in the biggest mixing bowl because it tends to make a mess when you mix it and it might be so dense that you have to knead it a little by hand i find that the chocolate dough has to feel a little firmer and drier than the others if you want it to cook and spread at the same rate as the others baking sheet with some parchment if you don't have parchment i'd grease and flour it a bit i'll form my dough into a thick snake and then flatten it a little bit same deal with greeny thick snake then flatten into a long bar this gets you a pretty even thickness and baking throughout each piece again i'm shaping in ascending order of darkness so that i don't have to wash my hands the chocolate dough should feel a little stiffer and drier if it doesn't it's going to spread really flat couldn't tell you why now you can have some fun with toppings i've got some demerara sugar big crystals of less refined sugar slivered almonds over here really pile on your toppings because the surface area is going to expand a lot in the oven plus not everything is gonna stick though i find it helps to push the nuts in a little bit for the powdered sugar on the chocolate just pile it on do not press it in if you press it it dissolves a little and it doesn't look very pretty whatever will stick will stick there we go kind of funny how at this stage they don't look at all like what they're going to become i've found 325 convection or 350 conventional works best that's like 160 or 180c and i'll bake them until they feel just firm enough to cut these have been in half an hour and they still feel soft and gooey at their centers after 45 minutes it's much better they shouldn't feel hard on the inside yet but they should be springy and pillowy at their center with a firm outer shell pull these out and i have the best results if i cut these as soon as possible as soon as they have cooled firm enough that i can lift them off the parchment without breaking them the softer they are the cleaner the cuts i get cutting at an angle just for pretty and set aside that end piece then basically cut these as thin as possible too thin and you'll crush the loaf with your knife too thick and they'll be hard to fit between your back teeth i'll lay those each onto the baking sheet as i go no need for grease or parchment or anything now they're baked they're not going to stick almond one next i tried doing this with a serrated knife i tried different knife strokes i find i get the cleanest cuts if i use my chef's knife but i wield it like a bread knife saw back and forth with almost no downward pressure until it catches and bites through that outer shell then i can push the knife down and through without crushing the loaf you can position these right next to each other on the pan they are not going to spread at all anymore gotta blast through this last one because it's cooling fast and firming up saw with minimal pressure until the knife bites through the brittle shell then push through the rest the firmer this cools the more brittle it becomes and that kind of thing starts happening oh well this whole recipe should fit onto one pan back in the oven these go to dry out and go crispy those end pieces are already crispy so you can occupy yourself with those while you wait how hard you bake these is up to you just remember that they're going to get a little firmer as they cool so i pull them when they feel just barely still soft in the center just a teeny bit of squish left those had an hour 15 total in the oven though i'm sure your results will vary go by feel not by the clock let them cool and steam out all the way and you can seal these up and keep them for a lot longer than other cookies surely that's why biscotti and rusk and other twice baked things were invented in the first place dry things last a long time and of course they have a satisfying crunch though the high butter content has ensured that these are still crumbly and will not shatter your teeth plus butter good use this recipe to clean out your baking drawer of random half bags and let's see what you come up with

***RECIPE, SERVES 2***

1 large...",29:02.6, chicken piccata is generally a chicken breast flattened out floured and fried with a pan sauce based on lemon butter parsley and sometimes capers the capers are the best part imho rather than having it with pasta i figured out a good way of doing it with little faux noodles of asparagus asparagus is amazing with these flavors anyway and we save some calories here that we can spend on more butter first thing is to peel and chop a few garlic cloves and a couple of shallots or one big one like this roughly chop i like to see some big chunkies in the sauce and the garlic will be less likely to burn if it isn't super fine push that to the side a standard one pound bunch of asparagus the king of all green vegetables in my book and you don't want any of that woody part of the stem for this i'm feeling some resistance there so i'm going to trim even higher up these are not terribly fresh unfortunately here's the best slicing method i've found slice one very thin noodle off the asparagus and now it has a flat surface that you can roll it onto super stable and from here i can get three more super thin slices if you have thicker asparagus obviously you can get more than that a little slice off the side roller and nice and stable three more slices as thin as i can get them this is a little painstaking but it's the only time consuming part of this recipe and you certainly don't have to be perfect with each cut done and while we're here i'll slice my lemon in half time for the chicken one big breast like that should be enough for two people i'm making two portions gotta get it thinner and you could slice it into several thin medallions but today i'm slicing the whole thing vertically in half i just do that with my head down low on the counter so i can see from the side if i'm getting it even not bad i don't think you need to pound it super flat like a schnitzel really just the thick part at the top so it'll cook more evenly with the thin tail yes i'm pounding this with a pint glass that works fine the force that it would take to shatter this against the meat would also send meat flying across the room you're just not gonna do it okay i'll get my widest pan a generous coating of olive oil in there and heat on medium and i'll get everything else handy because once we start this is going to go super quick i like some chili flake and capers i like these big ones from spain and then you'll need a fork to reach in and lift them out of their brine gotta have some butter handy for the sauce and a knife to cut it with and water some people use chicken stock i think water is fine actually let me move all of that away because this chicken gonna splatter enough pepper and salt for both sides of the chicken and then a little handful of flour tossed that around and now i only have to wash my hand once and if you don't want the carbs you could skip the flour or you could use almond flour that works great just use a little lower heat or make some room in your daily carb budget by eating the sponsor of this video for breakfast magic spoon cereal let's thank them real quick magic spoon has the exact same flavor as your favorite cereals and

there's always a slightly bigger piece if you're nervous about sticking you can kind of slide it around for the first few seconds some people straight up breadcrumb and deep fried chicken piccata i think that just turns it into a schnitzel that little bit of flour just enhances browning and clings better to the sauce later whoops my heat is a little bit too high i'll knock that back a little bit got to make sure i don't burn any of the fond at the bottom of the pan because we're making a pan sauce in here in a minute i'm looking for these to hit 160 fahrenheit 70c in the thick part there it'll cook the rest of the way while it sits on the board the thicker one needed a few more seconds that was about six minutes total and now in goes the garlic shallots and asparagus i'm doing my vegetable side and my sauce at exactly the same time and i'll give them as much dry heat as i can before i'm worried that either the garlic or the fond is going to burn and at that point i'll deglaze with water and turn the heat up to high once the pan is wet nothing can burn as long as you keep moving everything got to keep the asparagus moving to cook it evenly and if the pan is ever looking dry more water again people use stock you can do that now i can start dropping in my other ingredients my capers between the salt and the chicken and the brine that's still clinging to these capers i'm probably not going to need any more salt in the dish some chili flake highly optional stir stir gotta keep the asparagus rotating around and then the lemon juice just passing it through my fingers to catch any seeds you might start with half a lemon for two portions i'm doing the whole lemon because well you know you can always squeeze more at the table alrighty when the asparagus is just starting to look floppy and noodly it's time to turn the heat off the bubbling has to pretty much stop before we can put in the butter a little more water there i got to make more sauce than it seems like we need because the sauce is for the asparagus and for the chicken drop in as much butter as your belief system will permit and stir to emulsify you should see the sauce noticeably thicken if it doesn't add more butter i'll taste for seasoning yeah no more salt but then again i was also using salted butter now this is important rather than dumping the asparagus onto the plate i'm lifting it out i want to leave most of the sauce behind in the pan that's looking a little army green but don't stress we're going to fix that by returning the pan to the warm burner and tearing in a whole ton of parsley nice bright green if you want to pre-slice your chicken now would be a great time and you can lift that onto the veg and coat everything in sauce that's nice but i think my sauce is a little runny more butter yeah that's what i'm talking about super glossy the magic emulsifying power of butter pequent i believe is the perfect word to describe that sauce though i have no idea how to pronounce it picant quint picante no idea but this good

***RECIPE, MAKES...",29:02.6, i think i figured out a good trick for making pad thai at home prep as many portions as you want but only cook one or two portions at a time this is especially helpful if you don't have a big wok and or a super powerful stove it might sound onerous to only cook a little at a time but wait until you see how fast it cooks pad thai of course is a noodle-based stir-fry in a sweet and sour sauce to me the sauce's defining ingredients are thai style fish sauce basically salty fermented fish juice and extract of the tamarind fruit had to get this at my asian market this is the concentrate which i prefer to tamarind paste it'll be our primary source of acidity though some people use vinegar or lime instead in a pinch you could replace both of these ingredients with worcestershire sauce this is a vinegary fermented fish sauce flavored with wait for it tamarind it wouldn't be exactly the same but it would do the same job and i suppose the other key ingredient is sugar the pad thai that i know and love from thai american restaurants is insanely sweet i'm using two or three tablespoons of sugar for two large portions a lot of people use brown sugar or various less refined sugars they'd all work about a tablespoon of fish sauce smells like feet tastes like meat very strong source of umami you only need a little and you could use soy sauce instead to keep it meatless i like a little bit of soy with the fish sauce maybe a teaspoon now the tamarind extract i'm using two teaspoons of the concentrate but you know about me and acidity you might want to start with half this quantity i also love the smooth glossy texture that you get from the concentrate if i diluted this with like two parts water to one part concentrate i'd get about the same strength as tamarind paste i'm not bothering to dilute because i'm going to add some water to the pan at the very end now the secret ingredient to what i'll describe as mall pad thai here in the states is ketchup before anybody sneers consider that many pad thai recipes call for vinegar sugar and tomato paste well guess what ketchup is this lightens the color and also makes the sauce more glossy i put in almost two tablespoons in there you have to play with the basic proportions to find out what you like and of course you could just buy a jarred pad thai sauce that's still a little gritty but the sugar will dissolve as we do everything else a big handful of peanuts for garnish i'll chop those up a little bit not too fine the whole point is to have some crunchy texture against the soft noodles today is a good day to have little prep bowls one bunch of green onions you could use any onion but these are good from my method because they cook almost instantly if you slice the whites really thin and then you have the greens up there that you can set aside and use as a raw garnish the rest will go into my aromatics bowl fresh ginger a little thumb size piece slice off the skin and chop it up a roughly equal amount of garlic peeled and coarsely chopped don't go too fine in the garlic or it'll be liable to burn here in the aromatics bowl with that and then i'm gonna do one red chili thinly sliced i'm leaving behind the top which is where a lot of the heat lives i'm gonna pick a big pile of cilantro leaves for garnish highly optional the other table garnish will be some lime wedges which you probably won't need if you use as much tamarind concentrate as i do oh and mung bean sprouts these came washed and prepped i just need to have the open bag handy now protein a couple of eggs vegans can totally skip them these scramble so much better if you salt them pretty heavily beat them thoroughly and then let them sit for like 10 minutes the salt kind of loosens the proteins and it helps them cook in these delicate thin sheets that i like in a stir fry time for the mother and child reunion one chicken breast should be enough protein for two dinner size portions shrimp or tofu work great as well the trick with the chicken breast is to cut it into three sections and then make very thin slices across the grain you should be able to see the meat fibers plain as day cut across them i'm basically slicing as thinly as i can across those fibers it helps to have a freshly sharpened knife for this cutting across the grain will get us much more tender pieces thin meat slices in stir fry tend to be chewy now i'll put these into two separate piles for my two big portions that i'm cooking gotta keep my salt handy and my final ingredient will be some water stir fries go so fast that you want to have every single thing prepped before you actually cook i've got all my ingredients within arm's reach and i'll scan my grocery receipt into the sponsor of this video fetch rewards

in a wide pan a little pinch of salt in there heat on high rice noodles sold for pad thai are usually flat and narrow though you can use wider ones half of this package will feed two people two ounces or 60 grams per portion and i'm sure this is going to make some people unhappy but i've been breaking these as i put them in the water if i don't the noodles are so long that i have a lot of trouble integrating them with the sauce and the other ingredients at the end i'm just stirring to make sure they don't stick to the bottom i think the more traditional way to cook thai rice noodles is to cover them in boiling water from a kettle or something and then let them steep i have found straight up boiling to be quicker and easier to control and i'm only gonna parboil them two or three minutes max then in this goes to a strainer and i'll shock with cold water to stop them from cooking and sticking to each other let that hang and drain and they'll hold there until i'm ready to finish cooking them i'll wipe out my pan real quick back on the stove heat on high you can get away with high heat on a non-stick pan as long as you keep the pan full of food to absorb that energy i'm using that bit of virgin oil as a thermometer the instant i see it just start to smoke i'll season my first pile of chicken real quick and then drop it in the pan get the pieces pushed out into a single flat layer wash my hand real quick and then from here on out i am showing you this in real time i'm not speeding any of this up by letting the meat just sit there we can get a little brown color on it without overcooking the interior they're going to cook most of the way on that side when i can see the bottom two thirds of these is opaque i'm going to throw in half of my aromatics the green onions the chili the garlic the ginger and then once they're in i'm gonna stir everything really aggressively the top of the chicken is still raw and that's just fine this is exactly how i would do it with whole shrimp too by the way for the same dish i tried it that way it was great i wanted to devise a process that did not involve cooking a bunch of things one at a time dumping them out putting them back in again lots of recipes have you do that i didn't want to do that i just want to put things in the pan and keep them there so i've pushed everything over to one side of the pan and the chicken still should not be quite cooked that's fine time for half of the beaten eggs in a really thin layer spread it around let it sit and start to solidify wait for it wait for it wait for it then you can scrape at it with the spoon and this gets you those thin sheets of egg that are really nice in a stir fry salting the eggs also helps them to not overcook even when you get some color on them which is what i'm trying to do here the salt loosens those proteins so they don't squeeze all the water out of the egg so we'll push all of that egg to one side go over to the sink and grab some of those parboiled noodles and there they go they'll finish cooking now half of my sauce is going to go in next or maybe less than half you can always add more i suppose i like my pad thai very saucy so in goes half of that sauce and i'm gonna grab a big handful of those mung bean sprouts i like a lot of those i mean really i like half bean sprouts half noodles that's way healthier too i also like to get some of the peanuts mixed through everything we'll garnish with some at the end but a little bit of peanuts all the way through then stir stir stir stir some people prefer to keep the bean sprouts totally raw adam at the end i like for them to basically blend in with the noodles and you can kind of mistake them for the noodles they're just barely going to cook anyway because we're almost done here i like to keep my sauce really tight and dry not much water in the sauce that's why i didn't dilute anything so that now at the very end i can just add as much water as i want to get that level of saucy texture that i desire so i'm just going to wait until this is looking pretty much as mixed as i can get it and grab the water and grab the water this is weird to do in real time and there we go and that just deglazes the pan too which is really really nice and we'll just give that a few seconds to cook and tighten up again the water helps you get everything really smoothly mixed together if we were cooking several portions at once in this little pan we just wouldn't be able to get the intense heat that gives a stir fry its characteristic flavor you need a big wok on a rip roaring burner for that but for one big dinner portion this is perfect beautiful done garnishes on the side pile of cilantro more peanuts to sprinkle on top for heterogeneity lime for squeezing and maybe i'll put the onion greens on top man i love this stuff the feet smell of fish sauce boils right out don't worry about that it's gone and check the chicken pieces brown and yet not overcooked that's quite a magic trick with thin pieces of white meat and now you can turn around and do the next portion which should take literally no more than three minutes as we have just proven please do not take this as an attempt at definitive authentic pad thai it's just how i've gotten the best results in my kitchen chasing the version of the dish that i know and love and since my favorite thai place where i live just closed i am very happy to have cracked this nut to my own satisfaction

***PIZZA 1,...",29:02.6, french bread pizza is this american school lunch abomination we always had it fridays at my elementary school you take a big soft white loaf that no frenchman would recognize as being french or bread probably you cut it into big boats on a baking sheet and soak it in plenty of olive oil or butter or margarine and maybe some seasoning like it's garlic bread if you don't soak some fat in there it ends up being really dry most recipes have you toast the pieces in the oven for a few minutes if you don't do that the final thing ends up being super soggy then you smooth on some pizza sauce top with cheese and bake until the cheese is melted there you go cut that up and lauren said it tastes like a busy mom in the 80s just doing her best you know it's a good meal concept and i'm sure it could be improved first by actually browning the cheese but here's why people don't usually do that fully baked bread will burn at the temperatures at which cheese browns that's why the cheese on french bread pizza is usually pretty pallid i tried covering the exposed edges in little strips of aluminum foil that was a pain and the cheese stuck to it you want to see the easy thing that i found works dabbing it with water that's all a pastry brush into a bowl of water liberally dab the exposed edge of bread right before it goes in the oven if you do it too far in advance the water soaks too far deep into the bread there you go much better and you might get a few charred spots still but it's nothing you can't just pinch off those edges are not soggy at all the water has evaporated and they've browned nicely the water just slowed them down already quite a bit tastier but let's start fresh rather than think of this as garlic bread with pizza toppings let's think of it like an open-faced panini a sandwich sized ciabatta cut in half oven-safe pan on the stove big knob of butter turn the heat on medium you could use olive oil but butter is tasty and it's great at being its own thermometer when it's starting to bubble yeah i'm gonna season my pan not my bread just a little salt that i want to fry into that bread surface mop up all that butter and seasoning into the cut sides and then it's time to smash this is a brick wrapped in foil but anything flat and heavy will do it smashing that bread down gets you really thorough browning my oven is cold i'm just going to flip on the top element the broiler it heats in like two minutes ah you can see the outside rim of the pan is not as hot i'll rotate these around and give them another minute beautiful flip them onto their back sides and i'm gonna put in a little olive oil to fry the bottoms it tastes good in combination with the butter and it's less likely to burn in this next phase turning my heat off because electric burners like these take a long time to cool down if i was doing this on gas i'd probably just turn it to low while i dress the pizzas you can get a nice little effect if you put some big pieces of fresh herb on the sauce layer whole parsley leaves or half basil leaves a little parmesan topped with some mozzarella and i want those parsley leaves poking through semi-covered they're gonna look real pretty and the key step that i'm very happy i figured out brush all the exposed bread with water that should keep it safe under the grill as brits would

that link and code in the description for 83 off thank you surf shock all right now throw these under the broiler watch them close they only took four minutes under there and there you go looks like the thumbnail to me anything like this will be crispier if you cool it on a rack so steam can escape those edges would be burnt black if we had not done the water trick any sauce could work here i'm just using my standard sauce which is this brand of very strongly flavored ground tomatoes a little olive oil spices maybe a pinch of sugar that's it any mozzarella is fine but i'm using my very favorite pizza cheese which is this brand of whole milk low moisture string cheese it's a pain to unwrap and chop up if you're gonna make a bunch of big pizzas but it's actually perfect for making little french bread pizzas because you only need like two sticks worth for this and the rest stays vacuum sealed it's convenient nice and crispy shiny bottom on those and because we press them flat they have that satisfyingly dense panini bite they're easier to fit in your mouth and frankly the experience is just much more pizza like than eating a big thick loaf okay let's do one more where we get creative a couple of garlic cloves and orange zest it might sound weird but orange and tomato is my new favorite flavor combination save that orange we'll use it then some parsley i'm making gremolata which is my new favorite pizza topping it's usually made with lemon zest but i'm loving it with orange you just chop it into itself and the flavors really do seem to merge set that aside i'll peel and roughly chop a shallot and check out this new sauce that i've been playing with olive oil in a pretty hot pan saute the shallots until they're just starting to brown and then in go a few high quality whole canned plum tomatoes i'll mash those up a little bit to get them going but we're going to puree this later so don't stress about it my heat is like medium high i'll just stir these until they get some color the pan starts to go dry before that stuff on the bottom burns deglaze with the juice of that orange i'm just using my hand to catch any seeds all the juice from that orange get everything deglazed and that's it and it goes to a narrow vessel followed by a couple more of the nearly raw tomatoes straight from the can the sauce would taste too cooked without them and hit these with the stick until smooth tomato and orange i swear it's awesome it's just a little sweet so balance that with some chili nice and let's do a bigger pizza this time a real big loaf here and it can be stale this is stale that's as big a bread boat as will fit in my biggest pan my 12 incher but first big chunks of pancetta or any bacon-like product cold pan turn the heat on medium and let that fat slowly render as the heat comes in stir a bit and you don't want to take them any farther than this at this stage otherwise they'll have the texture of bacon bits by the time the pizza is done i'm just pulling out most of them while trying to leave any fat behind arrange the remaining meat and roughly the shape of the bread i think i need some more fat so a little olive oil and then in goes the bread cut side down and this time i'll smash it flat with another pan that works you just gotta lean into it with your body weight just takes a couple of minutes and you can smell when it's about ready to flip that bread stuck a little bit no problem spatula got it off and yeah now we've got browned pancetta chunks embedded into our bread it's a good day to be alive just a little more olive oil to fry the bottom turn the heat off i'll dust with a little garlic powder i meant to do that on the last one too on goes that sauce a little parm from the can just tastes right on pizza to me the stuff from the can carefully place that cheese you don't want too much of it to roll off onto the pan it'll burn and smell finally the remaining pancetta in and amongst the cheese can't forget to brush the exposed cut sides with water sometimes i start these on the middle rack under the broiler and then maybe move them to the top depending on how they're looking again it was just maybe five minutes and here we are hot with three t's sprinkle that with some gremolata and let it cool on the rack i love the flaky crispy bottom that you get from using the top of the bread loaf chop that up and come on how are you gonna be snobby about that that is good food i don't care if it's descended from a frozen dinner that they gave us at park forest elementary on fridays in 1989 that is good pizza

***TUNA SALAD***

pouched or canned tuna,...",29:02.6, a chopped cold protein bound in something creamy usually mayonnaise flavored with some other stuff and usually eaten as a sandwich filling that is what salad means in this context for those who didn't grow up eating this for lunch all the time it's one of my favorite things to eat especially the egg salad i'm going to show you that i'm going to show you tuna salad and chicken salad and hopefully give you some ideas about how you can play with the basic concept lots of ways to be creative here basic tuna salad first these days you have the can or you have the pouch either is fine but if you use the can you have to drain it first they have to add way more water or oil to get a good seal inside the can i always just squeeze the lid into the can to wring out the water the vacuum pouch has hardly any water in it why not just cook fresh tuna for this i don't know it seems like kind of a waste for something so special as fresh tuna this whole sandwich evolved as a way to make the cheap canned stuff palatable i say go with it and the mayonnaise works great because the fish is so lean i always just eyeball a few scoops at first you can mix in more later for onion to me this is so a job for shallots i want the crunch so i want to use a lot of onion and relatively big pieces shallots are mild so you can do that without completely blowing your head off with onion steak my parents always used the dried onion flakes or a powder from a bottle this is the secret i didn't learn until i moved to the south sweet pickle relish when my time comes bury me with this it makes everything amazing it might improve chocolate chip cookies it definitely makes tuna salad to die for grind in a bunch of pepper and i believe my love of garlic powder might have begun with this meal my folks always use that with the dried onion and no salt yet the tuna is usually pretty salty stir stir stir and oh i forgot the celery so good in these cold salads some people dice it i like to do thin slices across the whole stock i want that crunch to contrast with the soft fish and the creamy dressing and that goes and since you have it you might as well grab some of those leaves from the celery they taste amazing and they'll be pretty and green in here have a little taste yeah that needs a little salt but not much and for me i like the quantity of mayo in there but i think most people would find that a little dry i'll mix some more in lettuce is always nice to put on the sandwich if you have it and i quite like tomatoes if you've never had tuna salad soaked in sweet pickle relish before get ready for your life to change my friend so good and it's such a great thing to mix up in advance and eat for lunch for the next few days same deal with the egg salad we always make it with a whole dozen eggs first you gotta hard boil them some people say add vinegar and or salt to the boil water they say this will make the shell easier to peel i've never noticed the difference what has made a difference that i've noticed is dropping the eggs into already boiling water that seems to make the white pull away from the shell a bit oops i cracked one there it doesn't matter cover so it comes back up to a boil real fast and a chef friend of mine told me that 14 minutes is the ideal time for hard boiled it seems to work great and that gives me plenty of time to head out to the garden and catch up on the world of business finance and tech with morning brew the sponsor of this video hey like my wheat i used to work in the news business and i'm quite

description thank you morningbrew now 14 minutes is up a lot of people would pull these out to an ice water bath with a slotted spoon or a spider or something a much easier option i think is to just drain through the pot lid drop it in the sink and spray them with cool water it doesn't matter if the water isn't ice cold between the convection and the water being constantly replaced as the pot spills over these eggs are going to be cooled off in no time yeah this uses some water but so would washing the big bowl that you used for the ice bath okay lauren is going to take this one from here she's an ace with egg salad she just smacks the egg all over with the back of a spoon focusing on the bottom where there's usually a little hollow she flips the spoon around pushes the edge up under the shell there nice that one came off all in one piece yeah give each one a rinse and repeat and for egg salad you're going to be chopping it all up into little bits anyway so who cares if you take a chunk out of the side of one of these get them all over to the cutting board and slice them in half lauren's approach to egg salad is inspired by deviled eggs and with deviled eggs you push all the cooked yolks out into a bowl and then you smash them smooth with your mayonnaise and such i think you end up needing almost equal parts mayo and egg yolk but she's smart to be conservative up front you can always add more in the south they dump in a ton of sweet pickle relish which is why southern deviled eggs are so much better also great in deviled eggs is a sinus clearing quantity of mustard a little salt and pepper and if you taste this now just remember that it needs to be strong enough to flavor all of this bland protein over here so it should be too strong for deviled eggs you would pipe the filling preciously back into each egg half it's much easier to just dice each of these up and dump them in the yellow stuff and because this is egg salad not deviled eggs i think that you want a fair bit of crunchy stuff in there an egg salad sandwich is so soft and mushy unless you have some fresh onion or again in this case some coarsely chopped shallot and i would use celery but lauren hates celery so how about some cucumber a nice mild taste won't drown out the subtle taste of the egg just tons of fresh watery crunch i usually leave some peel on it for color cut a half in half and then i'll kind of do three or four radial cuts so that i can now really easily get triangular thin slices again the goal is crunchy texture so i think it's nice to have wide pieces those are really going to freshen up this salad lauren thinks she put in too much salt let's have a taste now i think the salt is great but i'm going to want more shallot in there the onion flavor mellows as this sits in the fridge so i try to overshoot it that cucumber released some water overnight so if you use that and maybe undershoot the moisture a bit another good way to contrast the soft texture is to toast your bread lightly toast it if the toast is too rigid you'll squish the pieces together with your teeth and end up squeezing the salad out the sides like toothpaste i think egg salad is easier to eat on little rolls speaking of delicious things they introduced me to here in the south very nice okay let's talk chicken salad my folks used to use canned chicken but i think this is a perfect occasion to use a grocery store rotisserie chicken they're absurdly cheap they taste pretty good and they're soft so you can just pull the meat apart into chunks into the bowl whenever you're picking meat to mix into some other stuff i think you want to start with chunks that feel a little too big remember they're going to break apart and shred a bit as we stir them in with everything else the white meat on these chickens tends to be pretty dry but who cares we're going to cover this in mayo actually let's use something else this time a fancy alternative is mascarpone cheese italian cream cheese two problems though mascarpone is a little too thick and it can be kind of hard to find the solution to both issues is to make our own like two cups of whipping cream a pint four or five hundred mils medium heat just barely bring it up to a simmer and then juice in a lemon at least half a lemon for this much cream i ended up using the whole thing you'll see the acid instantly coagulate the cream and thicken it up to make mascarpone you would now put this in a cheesecloth and let it drain overnight but we would then have to thin it out with water or milk to get it loose enough to coat the chicken so let's just not do any of that let's just call this done here it is after it cools down a delicious spread in its own right and you may think wow that's pretty indulgent putting cream into chicken salad but i mean what is this now maybe 60 percent fat at this point mayo is like 95 percent fat so this is actually the light option and darn tasty and say you don't want to use shallots a bunch of green onions works great for all the same reasons mild flavor when raw a little crunch but not too much i did thin slices down at the firm white end and i'm doing progressively bigger pieces as we get up into the greens which are more like a fresh herb we get some nice green color in there to boot say you don't want to use the sweet pickle relish again how about some sweet corn shave off of kernels and you've got a hit of sugar that really helps this what you don't get from the corn is any acid fruit has acidity and sweetness which is why a lot of people use apple in chicken salad or grapes like these are very nice half is going to be too big i'm gonna go quarters there we go these will give us the brightening that we would get from the relish unfortunately grapes are soft and i want even more crunch so nuts any kind these are pistachios love them once you get them out of their shells you do probably want to smash them or chop them a bit not too much the whole point is to have some texture in there pepper a little bit of salt to start with rotisserie chickens are already pretty salty a little parsley is nice if you've got it and give this a preliminary stir i can see that i'll probably need the rest of my thickened acidified cream whatever you want to call it the lemon in there really freshens up the taste of the chicken oh and i forgot my garlic powder the best that's some pretty fancy stuff as chicken salad goes the one hitch is the cream really stiffens up in the fridge a virtue of mayo is that it's pretty much the same consistency at any temperature the cream you might want to let warm up a bit before you eat it but man is it tasty and any of these ideas could transfer to any of the other recipes mix up a bowl and have lunch taken care of for the next three or four days

Use code ADAMRAGUSEA12 to get up to 12 FREE MEALS across your first four HelloFresh boxes, including free shipping on your first box: https://bit.ly/...",29:02.6, here's two dead simple lasagnas you can assemble in minutes both built on dried lasagna noodles that we layer straight into the pan no boiling i'm calling this one lasagna ogratin and this one lasagna o tuesday it's shockingly good despite the fact that we're just gonna dump in a bunch of prepared ingredients the pan will be the only dirty dish and the biggest downside of not boiling your noodles is they have to fit whatever pan you're using you can break them but that's obviously not ideal this brand makes a shorter lasagna that fits right into a standard 8 inch or 20 centimeter square pan excellent we're not going to pre-cook a sauce so we cannot use whole canned tomatoes like that too much water in the can you want a can of crushed or ground tomatoes ideally a brand with particularly concentrated flavor this is the one i use for pizza sauce and it's perfect for this lasagna just a little bit goes in the bottom of the pan to keep the first layer of noodles wet and the way i'm going to do this is season each layer as it goes in a little olive oil just for flavor smoosh that around and then sprinkle in just a little salt canned tomatoes usually already have some salt in them and then i'm just shaking in rando italian herbs and spices garlic and onion powder since we don't have the fresh forms of either dried oregano basil marjoram parsley chili flakes you could just buy an italian seasoning blend but i am apparently too italian to own an italian seasoning blend because that makes sense first lasagna noodles are in and this is going to feel kind of weird but i'm going to sprinkle them with salt just a little salt the second biggest downside of not boiling your noodles is they won't be seasoned by the salty water so a little salt okay i've got one pound half a kilo of ricotta cheese the big benefit of ricotta as a filling is that it isn't terrible for you it's very high protein and even the whole milk kind is pretty low cal as cheeses go half of that container in and smoosh it out you might could top that with some grated mozzarella yes i'm using a pre-grated bag today it's tuesday nona i don't have time for your judgment you see what else i'm doing i'm reaching for the green can of grated ostensible parmesan just let me live my life noodles on and then that sprinkling of salt you could just strategically over season your sauce and depend on it to donate salt to the pasta but with this recipe i'm not pre-mixing anything and i'm not really tasting anything i'm just eyeballing and seasoning each layer one by one allows me to keep track visually of how much total salt i need to put in plus maybe the pasta gets seasoned a little bit better if it's in immediate proximity to those dissolved grains no idea but there's the rest of my ricotta and leave yourself enough mozzarella to melt on the top later fourth and final pasta layer sprinkle with salt i always try to finish with sauce on top we need that sauce to keep everything wet i ended up using like 80 percent of that standard 28 ounce 800 gram can herbs and spices maybe a little bit more olive oil for good measure and seal tightly with foil got to keep that steam trapped in there to cook the pasta in the oven at 350 fahrenheit 180c that's a little cooler than my normal lasagna temperature but we need to cook this one a little slower to let that pasta soften before anything starts drying out 45 minutes later here we are time to top with the reserved mozzarella and back this goes for 15 minutes uncovered i want to give excess water a chance to evaporate it's been in for an hour total and now i will turn on my top element my broiler to brown the cheese once you turn that on don't walk away it'll only take a couple of minutes and could burn real fast let this cool and solidify at least 15 minutes i'd say before cutting and scooping a little fresh basil cheers that up and if you want it to look a little neater bake it the night before and chill it whole in the fridge the next day it'll be firm and you can cut it really cleanly reheat in the oven and here's the trick that i just figured out maybe you already knew it sit the pieces on just a little splash of water cover with foil and then the water keeps the whole thing from drying out but especially that bottom layer of pasta after 15 minutes it's ready to eat but you can freshen up how it looks by melting on a little more mozzarella with your top element check out how tidy that looks you know i always say that you want to be careful about overcooking your pizza sauce otherwise your pizza will taste like lasagna this lasagna kind of tastes like pizza the sauce has not been cooked very much so it's really bright and fresh i kind of love it and the pasta is still pleasantly al dente because we didn't parboil it that is a tremendous weeknight home helper much like the sponsor of this video hello fresh america's number one meal kit lauren and i really do subscribe to hello fresh and we really do rely on it a few nights a week it's a life saver this meal has literally no chopping we didn't have to go to the grocery store and everything is pre-portioned which means much less food waste like purple cabbage is one of my favorite things but very rarely can i actually use the whole head that they sell at the store a university of michigan study found that the carbon footprint of a meal like this is 25 percent lower than

adamragucia12 to get 12 free meals including free shipping 12 free meals with my link and code in the description thank you hello fresh now the second lasagna we're going to do is just as quick and easy if you have some frozen bolognese or other meat sauce in your chill chest i have a recipe linked in the description that i make all the time in huge batches and freeze but for the sake of demonstration let's make a quick meat sauce ourselves right now just for this lasagna an onion and a big carrot diced up pretty fine cut it into thin slices cut the slices into long sticks line the sticks up and mow them into little cuboids you could skip the carrot honestly i just like it a wide pan will cook this sauce quicker and it doesn't have to be terribly deep because we're only making enough for the lasagna i'm blasting my veg in a little olive oil on high heat keep it moving constantly and it will not burn until it's cooked off a ton of its water four or five minutes later and i see things are getting soft and dry enough now that they're starting to brown time to push everything out to the side and smash in my one pound or half a kilo of ground beef this is chuck you could totally use one of these fancy new soy protein fake meats instead my new favorite way to brown ground meat is just to push it out into a thin disc and then leave it there for a couple of minutes until i can really smell it going brown before it burns i'll start scraping it up and all the water that's going to come out of the rest of the meat should be enough to deglaze whatever is stuck to the bottom with a smash trick the amount of brown flavor i get is so great that i really don't have to worry about browning the rest of the meat in there i mean if i was browning several pounds of meat i'd keep frying until everything was really brown but with this much gnat i've got enough browning proportionally already so in goes a big squeeze of tomato paste to brown for just a second before it burns i'm going to deglaze with tomato water remember how i said cans of whole tomatoes have a ton of water in them there you go deglaze the pan with that and now that it's out of the can i can reach in there and just give everything a preliminary squish this will help the tomatoes cook more quickly once i get them in the pan a whole bunch of the aforementioned italian herbs and spices just a pinch of salt to start with we can taste for salt at the end reduce that heat to a simmer and let it go for as long as you have patience for here it is after an hour and i always like to say you can replace wine in recipes like this with a little balsamic vinegar this is white balsamic for cooking purposes it's basically white wine concentrate just a little splash for acidity and sweetness stir and taste for seasoning no more salt i like that it's done i'm going to make a lasagna twice as big this time i think these noodles should fit just barely yeah first thing i'm going to do is flood the pan with a thin layer of cream oh white on white that's great filmmaking ragusa bravo lasagna noodles on a sprinkling of salt just because i liked how well this seasoning method worked on my other lasagna and if you can be bothered to chop it up some fresh garlic goes really great with the cream i'll spoon on a layer of my meat sauce you know instead of a pound of ground meat you can make a great sauce with like 2 pounds of finely chopped mushrooms just cook the crap out of them to drive off the water and get them brown very nice a shake of parmesan just for kicks and another pasta layer sprinkle with salt and garlic and then more meat sauce and repeat i'm saving time by not bothering to make some kind of white sauce to alternate with my meat sauce just meat sauce alternated with pasta instead once i've built up my four layers i'm gonna pour in more cream the cream drips around and settles in different little pockets and when it cooks it flows to the top so the result is some of the heterogeneity you would normally get by building alternating layers but this is way less work i've got a pint of cream in there total 500 ml or so cover tightly with foil and bake as before 45 minutes at 180c uncover and that might not look very appealing but this is why the universe gave us melted cheese 15 minutes uncovered then flip on what brits called the grill to brown the top and look at the undulating waves that sprung up as the pasta cooked and expanded outward that's probably analogous to some geological process that results in rolling hills scoop it after a 15-minute rest and it'll look like this you bake raw cream with something starchy and it turns into a delicious sauce it works in a potato gratin it works in lasagna for a tidier presentation here we are cutting it after it's chilled sit the pieces in a little water to keep everything moist 15 minutes covered a little fresh cheese under the broiler for a sec and here we are right back where we started that's called a circular narrative works great in the movies
Do you have to boil lasagna noodles before baking?,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ukf3BVHcASc/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLAxB6ZDKvfCEs5EA20nps3SNGmbsw,ukf3BVHcASc,"11 minutes, 31 seconds","Thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this video! Go to Squarespace.com for a free trial, and when you’re ready to launch, go to http://squarespace.com/ragusea​​​ and add code “RAGUSEA""...",29:02.6, this video is sponsored by squarespace yeah you do not have to pre-cook any kind of pasta for lasagna even dried pasta like this you can just layer them right into the pan with your other ingredients they will cook in the moisture of your sauce with dried noodles that comes out surprisingly good but of course just because you do not have to do something doesn't mean you do not want to you might still want to parboil your pasta even though it is kind of a pain i think it is particularly worthwhile with homemade fresh pasta but i think the reason people have such divergent opinions about this is because pretty much anything that you could do works and the resulting differences in the finished product are more subtle than you would expect or at least more subtle than i'd expect i'm gonna show you a whole bunch of test bakes that i did and i'm gonna try to describe how they tasted my sauce is just some fried off onions tomato paste browned a little in the pan and this brand of crushed tomatoes super good a little wine lots of herbs and spices simmer for at least an hour my cheese layer is grated mozzarella into a bunch of ricotta a bunch of grated parmesan eggs peppers salt mix it all up these are the standard italian-american lasagna fillings i'd say though we would often put ground beef in the sauce now in a way the most obvious choice of noodle here would be these fresh pasta sheets specifically formulated and shaped to go directly into a lasagna pan with no pre-cooking you can see they're more like semi-fresh they're stiffer and less sticky than real homemade fresh pasta my sense from watching tv is that brits and other europeans have had these for a long time i did not start seeing these in mainstream us supermarkets until a few years ago and it's usually in the refrigerator cases around the deli section and what could be easier right if you can get these it's a great weeknight dinner i'm just kind of underwhelmed by the taste and texture they come out a little gummy i'm not a huge fan let's go to dried pasta standard dry lasagna noodles this is the way my dad taught me to make lasagna i imagine how his italian mother taught him you par boil partially boil the noodles pretty much just until they are pliable maybe half or two thirds of the cooking time that they give on the package you then pull them out to ice water to stop the cooking if you don't shock them like this they tend to be way too soft in the end plus they'd stick together as they cooled all laid out on a towel and use another towel to dry off the top sides and then if you want you can trim them so they'll perfectly fit whatever size pan you're using and you don't have to throw those trimmings away fry them up in a pan with some butter fresh herbs top with some cheese very nice i usually start with a little sauce to keep the bottom layer of pasta from sticking or drying then for all these tests i'm doing one cup of sauce or cheese for each layer and building four total layers i'm just trying to keep everything standard to isolate the boiling variable top with some reserved mozzarella cover with foil for baking let's build an identical lasagna now with dry noodles the first problem that you're going to run into is that they aren't pliable so they have to perfectly fit the pan that you plan to bake them in if you don't you have to like snip off the end or break off the end which is kind of tricky to do without just like totally shattering this thing the best method that i came up with was to position one finger behind the line that i want to break across and then push outward still not great bend the noodle over your guide finger and that's better there same deal as before a cup of filling between each layer but here's an important caveat par boiling serves another important function which is to season the inside of the noodle you would normally boil it in salted water if your noodles were not made with much salt inside them and if you're not par boiling them then you have to over season your other elements they shouldn't be disgustingly salty but they should definitely taste a little too salty in isolation they are donating seasoning to all of this bland bulk that we are layering in i imagine that sealing with foil will be even more important here to trap the water the noodles need speaking of which i want to try a third lasagna where we put in some extra water the amount of water equivalent to the water that would have been absorbed if we had parboiled the pasta which for my lasagna here is approximately 144 grams apparently i'll measure out a little more than that because you're going to lose some to evaporation i probably could have just poured this water directly over the fully assembled lasagna before i baked it but to be safe i'll pour it directly onto each pasta layer as i build in little doses just to be sure that it's evenly distributed all three test lasagnas go into the oven at 400 fahrenheit 200c i'll uncover after about 40 minutes and give them a second dose of mozzarella on top 10 minutes later i'll flip on the top element the broiler to brown the cheese and then here we are par boiled raw with extra water raw with no extra water the difference is visually apparent the dry one looks drier though not in a bad way i don't think time to taste parboil noodles that feels like the lasagna i grew up with the pasta isn't exactly al dente but it isn't mushy either really nice here's raw noodles baked with extra water the noodles are noticeably firmer but not in a bad way raw noodles with no extra water here i am surprised by how little textural difference there is compared to the one we did with extra water the texture is virtually identical between them they're both pleasantly firm one difference that i did notice was a slightly more concentrated flavor in the dry lasagna which is hardly surprising the extra water that we added into this one diluted the flavor a little bit so next time i'll use salt water to me the real test of lasagna is how it tastes the next day because baked pasta dishes are almost always better reheated i try to make lasagna the day before i want to eat it so i can reheat it for 20 minutes in the oven and then boom this is the lasagna that we cooked totally dry the fact that the noodles were noticeably firmer yesterday means that they have held up better into today the noodle always softens a little bit with the reheating so i kind of think that was perfect one problem is the bottom layer of noodle is really dry and tough i can't cut through it with my fork i reckon there's some things we could do to prevent that problem though maybe bake it in a different kind of pan lower the temperature maybe bake it in a water bath we'll get back to that time now to repeat the experiment with real homemade fresh egg pasta eggs a glug of olive oil and flour whisk until you can whisk no more get in with your hands and knead until you can knead no more knead in basically as much flour as it'll take you want it smooth elastic and only slightly sticky cover and let rest in the fridge for a while so the flour can rehydrate time to roll and i think i'm going to be up late on this one good lord this is a hard job to do without a second person to help you feed it through for lasagna i go down to the second thinnest setting i'll trim these into the perfect size for my pan and store them on the ancestral fresh pasta storage system a clothes drying rack and not my finest work but hey it's going to be covered up in a lasagna so whatever just blast through them 12 noodles go into boiling water when you boil dry pasta you're making it softer when you boil fresh pasta you're making it firmer especially egg pasta you are setting that protein structure when all the noodles have visibly puffed up a bit and lightened in color out they come to the ice water get them all cooled down and separated from each other lay those out on a towel to dry it is so late i am so tired i love fresh pasta but it does not love me back i'll build my lasagnas exactly as before with a cup of filling in between all four layers time to repeat with the raw noodles look at how much smaller they are in there egg pasta puffs up so much when you boil it that one's all done and how much water did these absorb when boiled about the same proportion as the dry pasta a little math and i will supplement this one with a roughly equivalent amount of water salty water this time i learned my lesson for what it's worth i don't think that i would ever actually make lasagna like that if i wanted it a little bit wetter i would just not boil so much water out of my tomato sauce i'll bake these exactly as i did before could have gotten some better color on those but boiled raw with extra water raw and dry look at how much taller the boiled one is compared to the dry one though the boiled one shrank down as it cooled i guess that was steam puffing it up and that is very delicious the boiled fresh pasta homemade egg noodles man there is nothing like them now check out the raw noodles with extra water what a nice clean cut we got there same deal with the raw and dry one if i was cooking for instagram then clearly i would use the raw fresh egg noodles but because i'm cooking for my mouth nah the fact that those fresh raw noodles cut so smoothly is reflected in their texture they are a little brittle they're a little mealy the boiled fresh noodles were harder to cut because they are more elastic which i think is the way pasta should be now look if your family has been making lasagna with raw fresh egg noodles for generations and you love it please don't think that i'm trying to tell you you're wrong i mean this is just what i like i'm just here to tell you there definitely is a noticeable difference between boiled fresh noodles and lasagna and raw fresh noodles in lasagna though again there's hardly any difference at all between the one cooked with extra water and the one cooked dry that is interesting i just didn't really like either of them again there's just that kind of mealy texture those noodles also felt a little leathery to me in some spots and a little bit gummy in others not a fan if i'm going to go through the herculean effort of making fresh pasta from scratch for my lasagna i'm gonna do it the way i want it and the way that i want it is boiled and if you are bothered by that messy cut do the trick that i'm pretty sure a lot of restaurants use which is to chill the lasagna overnight it's now very firm and you can get a very clean cut on it reheat it covered for about 15 minutes uncover and then you can freshen up the appearance with a little more cheese on top melt and broil until brown and there you go a ton of work but i don't think lasagna gets much better than that however the fact that raw dry lasagna noodles got me such good results makes me wonder if i couldn't come up with a weeknight lasagna recipe that i would really really like

Here's the J. Kenji López-Alt article I mentioned about whether...",29:02.6, virtually every warm weather culture on earth has some version of red beans and rice this is the version from around where i live in the southern u.s cheap easy tasty and good for you it's the night before and i will soak my pound of beans half a kilo my preference is for small red beans also known as mexican red beans i like how they taste and they cook pretty fast but a lot of people use red kidney beans for this which are totally fine too i don't measure the water when i soak i just eyeball at least enough for them to double in size while staying submerged people have such divergent opinions about whether you should salt your soak water or put baking soda in there or put nothing in there i increasingly think this is because all of the common methods work they just do slightly different things today i'm trying our friend kenji's method where you soak in like 15 grams of salt per liter that's like two tablespoons of morton kosher for this much water he says this gets you creamier texture inside the beans here we are the next day if you cook in the soak water you'll get more vivid color but i'm going with kenji today who advises dumping it and even rinsing he says he gets better texture this way and there is some research that says dumping the soak water reduces certain undesirable digestive outcomes but it's prob not a big difference either way i go back and forth on the matter big pot on the stove coat it with olive oil and time for the holy trinity as they call it in louisiana onion bell pepper and celery i'm going with red everything for the color i like a medium dice on my veg for beans if the cooked pieces are too big they can feel kind of slimy if they're too small they end up effectively thickening the sauce and making it mushy instead of silky in those go a big bell pepper i'm doing the trick where you fillet off the sides of flesh that you do want seeds and stem are all that remain toss those again shooting for a medium dice on this for the same reasons as the onion then a couple of stalks of celery the easy way to dice these is to cut them in half lay each half on its back lay your knife securely inside that channel and then cut each one into like three long bars do that to all of them and then you can line them up in one big stack and chop through super nice medium dice celery is one of the vegetables i've been advised to eat for the purpose of feeding my gut microbiome which i just had analyzed by the sponsor of this video thrive let's thank them the science on gut health is

you can get personalized probiotics from thrive formulated for what your gut needs this is all legit here are the doctors do us both a favor and save 50 on your thrive test with my link in the description half off with my link thank you thrive now i'm just giving my trinity here a head start my heat is on high there's tons of water in here to evaporate out before anything will come close to burning as long as you keep stirring constantly when these seem half cooked maybe two thirds i'll squeeze in a tablespoon or two of tomato paste this brings red color and a lot of depth of taste sweetness and umami stir it in and it's filled with sugar so it's gonna burn if we don't get some other stuff in there fast all the beans and then some fresh water a lot of recipes call for chicken stock i think that's totally unnecessary we have a stronger source of meaty flavor coming in louisiana it'd probably be andouille sausage where i live in georgia a common choice would be this a smoked ham hock it's the very tip of the shank or tibia bone there's hardly any actual meat on it it's the part of the ham that people usually just use as a handle it's all skin and bone which makes it perfect for flavoring other things a smoked turkey leg would be great instead if you don't want to use any animal parts i'd suggest a spoonful of smoked paprika great stuff time for herbs and spices i'm doing a big shake of paprika mostly for color an even bigger shake of garlic powder a tiny shake of cumin too much and it'll taste more latin than i'm going for same deal on the oregano just a bit this to me is the defining herb of southern red beans and rice dried sage just a tiny pinch of salt for now the beans are already soaked in salt that ham hock is salty so be conservative i'm turning down the heat to like medium medium-low i don't like to cook beans at a full boil i suspect that makes more of them burst and stuff has a tendency to stick to the bottom of the pot and burn a simmer would just be too slow so i'm looking for a low boil or an aggressive simmer whether i put the lid on is chiefly determined by whether i'm worried i put in too much water or too little in this case i'm worried i put in too much so no lid let the steam evaporate i prefer lidless anyway it lets me keep an eye on things just stir this every now and then it should take like 45 minutes longer if you use kidney beans because they're bigger meanwhile i can get my rice going i'm doing brown rice since it's better for me and i actually prefer the taste i'm cooking it pasta style that is any large volume of excess water that i will drain away later for long grain rices i really believe in this method if your brown rice always comes out gummy try this it's foolproof i didn't even bother washing my rice all the excess free starch is going to drain away here's my beans after like 20 minutes yep i'm nervous i put too much water in there and my gravy is going to be too thin glad i left the lid off you cook your rice pasta style and there's no guesswork just fish out a few grains with a fork to drain the water and taste when you like the texture you're done this was done in like a half hour which is really fast for brown rice you could either drain really thoroughly in a sieve or just do that through the pot lid and then put it back on the hot burner uncovered for a few minutes to steam off any loose water there you go tender fluffy grains if i have any green herbs around like parsley or cilantro i like to tear those into my rice it just gives it another dimension but it's hardly necessary after like 45 minutes it's time to taste a bean and see if it's done they get a little firmer as they cool so i try to cook them until they're a little softer than i want them same deal with the gravy it'll thicken as it cools so it looks like i actually judged the water quantity exactly right but always be conservative you can always add more water you can't suck it back out i don't think this needs any more salt i am now going to do my little bean trick which is not traditional it's just awesome a tiny pinch of sugar a nutritionally minuscule amount for this much food and then a little splash of vinegar really just a tad of both i don't want to taste them per se i just want them to kind of make everything else taste a little more alive my heat is off now by the way that's why the gravy is thickening that ham hock has a couple good bites of meat on it you could gnaw on it if you wanted or you could probably freeze it and flavor another pot of beans with it i only made enough rice there for two portions by the way half a cup of dry rice i'm gonna freeze the rest of my beans for later and for garnish again i don't think this is traditional but since you've got the celery why not reach in and grab some of the celery leaves these are an amazing fresh herb and there's one more key ingredient you know if i wasn't going to douse this in a vinegar-based hot sauce i would probably put a little more vinegar in with the beans i think beans almost always need a lot of brightening just put the acid in at the end acid at the beginning makes beans cook super slow our pot is gonna give us like six or eight portions so there's plenty to freeze into ice cube trays now you can thaw out exactly how much you want for a weeknight meal and have it with fresh rice that brown rice though is quite good for the digestion speaking of which don't forget to save 50 on your gut health test with my thrive link in the description you know i'm originally from up north so i didn't grow up eating beans and rice but somehow that just tastes like home no matter where home is or what they eat there tastes like home can't explain why

Thanks to Benjamin...",29:02.6, you can make an extremely satisfying dinner-sized chicken caesar salad by simply roasting the chicken on top of bread the bread becomes the croutons chicken fat croutons get yourself any kind of baking tray for four meal size portions i'd say at least a pound and a half 700 grams of skin on bone-in dark meat chicken pieces thighs are my preference but you could use legs i'll show you what those would look like i would not attempt to do this with breast meat white meat would turn into chalk with this method enough olive oil to coat a ton of salt we're seasoning more than just the chicken here and a ton of pepper i like some dried sage on roast chicken too and only because i'm already going to be using it in the dressing i might as well grate in the zest of this lemon i have tossed to get everything really well coated and then bread like half a pound of any bread 225 grams this is stale leftover bread which is of course what croutons were originally invented to utilize and i have torn it into a couple of big flat boats upon which we'll sail my chicken pieces i'm trying to get the bread as covered with chicken as possible and the chicken pieces are skin side up that's important my oven is already hot 350 fahrenheit 180c convection if you've got it the skin will keep the meat from drying out and the chicken will keep the bread from burning so you can just leave that in there for like an hour and a half this is easy but it's not quick halfway through you might move the pieces around just if you've got some bread that isn't covered in chicken you don't want that to burn so move the chicken on top and i just want to roast this meat until i can pull it apart like barbecue which of course only dark meat does now i guess i can just chill because i'm not making the dressing my friend ben is hey adam this is benjamin r harrison's famous caesar dressing that he talked about recently on his hugely popular star trek rewatch podcast it's called the greatest generation you should subscribe i write the music for them it's super goofy welcome to the greatest generation very simple this dressing is he's got a couple of big garlic cloves if you know anything about eating raw garlic you know that's gonna be a lot ben does not use the traditional mustard so the garlic is the pungency a big squeeze of mayonnaise that's in place of the traditional raw egg which squeezes a lot of people out please don't be skeezed out by the two anchovy fillets i swear this dressing will not taste fishy especially not with the juice of this lemon check been rolling it to bust up some of its internal structure thus making it easier to squeeze that's a big lemon even though it doesn't look like it because ben is a big man with big hands with a smaller lemon i'd use the whole thing he's using half maybe twice as much olive oil as he has lemon juice in there and then a shot of worcestershire sauce that brand is thickened with corn starch yours does not have to be thickened a pinch of salt just go easy at first the worcestershire sauce and the anchovies are very salty then a ton of pepper and hit it with a stick you could mince up the garlic and anchovies fine with a knife but the stick is super easy yes some real science says blender blades can create bitter flavors and extra virgin olive oil but the effect is pretty subtle and would be easily blown away by the extremely strong flavor of this all right dude all done oh sorry thank you i was just scanning my grocery receipt with the sponsor of this video fetch

chicken is brown it feels soft when i poke it it's done dark meat you can cook pretty much as long as you want to out those pieces come to a plate where they can cool so that i can pull them apart later i find that roasting the bread in big chunks helps keep it from overheating and developing burned flavors however we now have to chop it up into whatever size croutons we like and then return them to the pan to crisp up a little bit more while we finish the salad leave those crumbs behind they'll only burn i'll taste one of those for seasoning needs way more salt if you're feeling naughty you could drop in some butter and back in the oven just remember to reach in and stir those every now and then until they're crisp as you want them okay lettuce caesar salad is traditionally made with romaine lettuce if you had a big fresh one that'd be enough for four dinners this is a small not terribly fresh one so i bought a second when they're not fresh you have to discard the wilted outer leaves hey lettuce is dirty the leaves grow up through the dirt i prefer to tear my leaves into bite-sized pieces and then wash them you can chop salad people say that bruises the leaves more tearing theoretically pulls them apart along their cellular walls as opposed to just cutting through those walls with a knife it certainly doesn't matter if you're doing this shortly before dinner i just tear because it's easier to control little pretty leaves like that i want to leave whole into the sink and the way i like to do this is just submerge everything in a very big bowl swish it around and then lift the lettuce up and out into a strainer all the sand has settled to the bottom of the bowl we are lifting the lettuce up and away from it dry your lettuce on a towel but for what it's worth we started eating a lot more salad a few years ago once we got a salad spinner it's a cheap thing it's just a centrifuge that sends the water flying out to the outer bowl it is so easy and effective and dry lettuce holds dressing so much better into a big mixing bowl and this is my little salad trick mince up a couple of shallots pretty fine it's not like biting into a giant slice of raw onion in a salad you don't even notice it per se it just sends this subtle uniform fresh pungency through the leaves i can handle the chicken now without frying my fingers off so first i'm pulling the skin off this is why i prefer thighs to legs the skin comes off much more easily and you don't have to do this but yeah imma put those skins in with the croutons to get hot and crispy beautiful moist meat underneath you pull it apart with your fingers and you can feel around for chunks of cartilage or any slimy bits anything you don't want to eat and obviously you can take out the bones i recommend big pieces of meat because they'll break apart some more when you toss your salad i like to get the chicken coated in dressing along with the veg salads always need less dressing than you think because most of the volume here is just air so be conservative you can always mix in more i like my salads very lightly dressed which works perfect with the strong flavor of ben's recipe here big handful of that onto a plate one of those pretty little leaves from the heart now are super crunchy chicken fried croutons don't be afraid to pull them out of the oven when they still have some soft juicy spots on them those taste good and they get firmer as they cool some people put parmesan into caesar dressing i'm just depositing some fresh shavings on top heterogeneity and what would a salad be without a big crispy shard of chicken skin i mean duh that's just what salad is it's science caesar salad is such a delightfully old-fashioned thing it was invented in the 1920s by an italian chef in tijuana and it has a delightful roaring 20s decadence to it this is surely one of the most decadent versions definitely not diet food that's salad it's just good

these bakeries make cakes the size of love seats and then millions of weirdos on the internet like me watch videos where all they do is cut the cake because the cake goes back and forth and it is spellbinding i've made them myself before but with this chocolate recipe i have focused on making it taste as good as it looks the historical mother recipe for castella is i think four parts egg then one part each of fat milk flour and sugar by weight this is the basic ratio that all the recipes i've read seem to orbit around to convert it to a chocolate cake people usually seem to add an additional part of chocolate which itself is about half cocoa powder and half solid chocolate and then they usually up the sugar a little bit i played with these ratios until i got a cake that i think is really tasty and super jiggly rather than bake a giant one i'm doing a normal home kitchen size this is an 8 inch cake pan 20 centimeters and then you need a bigger pan that it will nest into my roasting tray is my biggest pan and in it goes to the middle of the oven where i will fill it part way with water not so much water that the displacement of my cake pan will cause a flood that's an easy thing to test for time to get all that heating up to 350 fahrenheit 180c i'm using my convection fan castella is a sponge cake and with any kind of sponge cake you pretty much have to line the pan with parchment paper i'm just cutting that piece into a square like the pan and then i will snip a little diagonal into each corner each cut is about the same length as the pan is deep now all i have to do is smash that in there and the corners fit pretty well there are more precise ways to line a square pan with parchment but that is good enough for me now batter a microwave safe bowl on the scale this is a rare time that i really think i need the precision of weight measurement 75 grams of any neutral cooking oil then comes about 35 grams of semi-sweet chocolate chips or any solid chocolate you like then about 60 grams of milk i find you got to cut back on the moisture a bit from the mother recipe to account for the moisture of the melted chocolate and melt this i will in the microwave you can do it on the stove just really gently for like 45 seconds in there until it's bubbling i'll take that out and whisk it smooth in goes about 40 grams of dutch cocoa i'm pretty sure they use dutch at original cake bakery in taipei whose recipe i'm basically trying to reverse engineer here their batter looks very dark at this stage it would be lighter if we use natural cocoa than cake flour and i really find bleached cake flour does better for jiggly cake it holds more moisture and gives you that pudding like texture 75 grams of that i don't think original cake does this but i really found a big splash of vanilla in there improves the flavor a lot and it's okay if this is kind of unmixable at this stage the egg yolks are coming six large eggs that i'm cracking into a bowl that should seem too big for the job we're gonna whip the whites in here the yolks all go into the chocolate mixture i've found that really fresh eggs help you avoid the kind of farty sulfurous egg aroma that a cake this eggy can have problem is fresh eggs are harder to separate the white really wants to stick to the yolk which is why i'm separating them in my fingers you can literally pinch off stubborn bits of white between your fingers i'll mix the yolks into all of this while it's still warm if the temperature drops too much the chocolate might solidify into hard little grains no worries if you can't get this totally smooth there's still more moisture coming over here the whites along with a tiny pinch of salt and a little bit of cream of tartar or really any food acid both chemicals help us to whip these proteins into a foam so pillowy that you would want to dive face first into it like my new mattress from the sponsor of this video helix let's thank them helix is a premium mattress in a box company it literally came in a box and it's made to fit your body and sleep preferences you just do what we did you go to helixsleep.com and take their quiz tell them your body dimensions and those of whomever you're sharing your bed with tell them how both of you sleep side stomach whatever and helix matches you we got the moonlight the super soft sheets and pillows and everything are also from helix lauren always wants a firmer bed i want a squishy one and this met us right in the middle it's like snuggling into a giant jiggly cake the way it kind of wraps around you but it is firm and supportive under there too do your back and this channel a favor and go to helixsleep.com you'll get up to 200 off your helix sleep mattress plus two free pillows that link is in the description thank you helix and did i mention that i weighed out like 130 grams of sugar in a little bowl might seem like a lot of sugar but i really think you need it to balance the chocolate and to give the cake a cotton candy like texture once the egg whites are very foamy and leaving trails like that behind the beaters you can gradually stir in the sugar a little bit of sugar you can dump in all at once but with this much you kind of gotta dose it or it might collapse the foam i've really found this is key to jiggly cake beating the sugar into the egg whites until you get a very fluffy stiff meringue the sugar reinforces the foam i'm looking for pretty stiff peaks like that snowy spire right there awesome we're done with the beaters now i'm gonna do that classical thing they do with souffles and such where you take a little bit of your foam and beat it mercilessly into your sticky ingredients you don't worry about preserving the bubbles you just use this to lighten up the mixture to get it smooth and ready to integrate more gently into the rest of the foam i'm doing that cut and fold over move with the spatula trying to integrate this in as few strokes as possible to preserve bubbles if you work it too much you'll feel it get less stiff it'll go all runny and liquid and then it won't bake as fluffy you could actually bake it streaky like that it comes out looking pretty cool but i'm gonna get it totally smooth and it is ready to pour in the pan the taller the cake is the more jiggly it'll be so i formulated this to fill my eight inch pan all the way to the brim if you're using a wider pan i think you'd want to up your batter quantities accordingly nice and smooth and i'm topping with a few chocolate chips sometimes they sink into the batter a little bit sometimes they don't either way they stay near the top where they provide some much needed heterogeneity you could mix them all the way through if you wanted all done just got to drop this gently into the water bath which will keep the sides of the cake from overheating and the steam will keep the dome of the cake pliable allowing everything to expand and balloon with steam 40 minutes in and you can see it's still raw in the center from how it sloshes 10 minutes later i'll poke it with a skewer still very muddy not done yet after about an hour total poke again and i find that you don't want it to be totally clean if it is the cake will be dry and not very jiggly that's perfect right there now i could try to lift out this pan but i'd probably get my oven mitts wet and maybe scald myself instead i'll just use the parchment sling and simply lift the cake right out of there i'll come back for both pans when they've cooled and there you go we can peel the paper off these eggy batters are super sticky imagine if it was stuck like this to the pan and you can't lube the pan the batter needs to stick to the walls so that it can climb and get super fluffy and jiggly cut that up in the videos from the bakeries in taiwan and such i always see them cutting it into big rectangles while it's still steaming hot i think it's good to eat this warm because it isn't so gelatinous after it cools that is really tasty and it's crazy to think that it doesn't have any gelatin or modified corn starch or anything it's just the magic of eggs making it so wobbly and with the chocolate the flavor is almost as good as the texture the chocolate easily overwhelms any unpleasant aroma you might get from the eggs you get the hang of this cake and you've got a pretty easy and simple recipe that'll make people very happy wubba wubba

Go to Squarespace.com for a free trial, and when you’re ready to launch, go to http://squarespace.com/ragusea​​ and add code “RAGUSEA""...",29:02.6, this video is sponsored by squarespace sous-vide i think i'm gonna say overrated which is not to say that sous-vide isn't good like soviet is really good it has lots of advantages but i also think that a lot of the things that are good about sous-vide are good about stewing and poaching generally right like it doesn't have to be in a bag i agree welcome everybody to ask adam a very special episode normally my lovely wife is the person who reads your questions to me to answer um this time it's uh it's somebody else um also named lauren though everyone who does this job has to be named lauren it's the law so you might recall that some episodes back i encouraged everybody to fill out a survey for a video that i did about meat washing practices and i said that of those people who filled out that survey um i would choose one to do an ask adam with me as a little bit of an incentive well um here's the winner congratulations hello hi nice to meet you lauren wilson tell the people about yourself alrighty well okay yes i am lauren um i'm a college student i go to brown in rhode island but currently you know because of the pandemic i'm actually at home in michigan and it's so funny i just saw your um serial episode that you just uploaded to your channel about battle creek and i thought that only people from michigan were proud that kellogg was headquartered there so definitely felt like a shout out it was great timing well thank you for watching my programs and thank you for doing this with me today um do we have a question the first thing i got was from your instagram i got do you ever regret leaving academia to pursue youtube uh or do you think that leaving mercer and pursuing youtube as a cook was the best idea in terms of your passion huh okay so in terms of my passions as opposed to in terms of like you know job security providing for my family all that kind of stuff okay yes no i don't think i regret it i you know i think that um this is like a good job for me it it it allows me to combine several of the distinct things that i like to do and have some competency with i i miss i miss the university environment in some ways i don't miss it in others i do not miss the uh you know the bureaucracy and the administration and and all that kind of stuff and when i say that i don't mean like the the people who constitute the administration like i know lovely administrators at many universities i just mean just the you know the committee meetings basically like the things i do miss about like the college environment is honestly like being around people like you lauren like um i think i imagine you may find as you get older that like um you know it it it can feel good to hang around with to be around younger people who are more energetic and less jaded you know i can see that it's energizing uh to be around people who have not been beaten down by the world yet um who have not totally sacrificed all their principles yet i mean they'll get there it's on their schedule but you know it feels good to be around that kind of like energy and youthful optimism and and but on the other hand like i don't this you know like there's a reason that you're here right now which is that it's like i think probably the plurality of my audience is like college-age people or thereabouts so i still am around you know y'all a lot um and that's nice but i miss you know you know being around y'all more because y'all are you know there's a reason the broader kind of culture is obsessed with youth in particular college in particular like it's a good it's a good scene it's a good place it's a good time of life for a lot of people if it's not a good time of life for you right now please don't not you lauren but whoever's watching um if you're not having a good time in college right now please don't think that that means that you're broken that something is wrong with you um that you'll never be happy later on in your life because that's like that's the dangerous thing about telling young people like oh you're going to go to college to be the best time of your life and you get there it's not the best time of your life and you think or rather you get there and it's bad you don't have a good time you think oh my god this is as good as it gets it's only downhill from here like that is soul crushing and that simply is not the case for a lot of people i did not have a very good time in college lots of people don't have a very good time in college like people you'll find your time and when you find your place in the world tell the world about it with a website from squarespace your

you squarespace and speaking of major changes um this is like more on a personal note but my dad actually recently moved to macon which is really crazy yes and what was made what made me originally interested in your video i think it must have come up you know on my recommended and then i saw macon and i was like what that's crazy so i think that is um something that definitely made me interested in you i guess what i'm wondering because i haven't gotten the chance to visit him yet because he moved during the pandemic was um what's like the food scene like out there and also are there any like ethnic cuisines that are kind of like prominent i know like in metro detroit where i'm from we have lots of lebanese food and things like that in terms of like the food scene i think that you know the things that i have responded to the most have been the things that you would expect the soul food scene uh the barbecue scene um and then there's like things within that category that are surprising like we have so many vegan soul food restaurants at this point it's a really and it's a really interesting scene that i would love to kind of feature once i can be around people safely again um you know just like all of the ways that you can make barbecue with jackfruit instead of pig is really interesting right um and and so that's cool but there's also it's like it's like the broader the broader phenomenon the kind of incredible flowering of of food that is happening everywhere is happening here too right like it you know it used to be that like the only you know good upscale restaurants were in like a handful of cities and now like any city in the highly developed world with a population over 50 000 or something has got at least one really good you know upper market restaurant and uh and that's awesome and that's you know the reasons for that proliferation are i think really complex and it's not entirely a good story but there's there's just you know there's there's some really really great like you know restaurants here as there are almost everywhere now and i think that's mostly a thing to be celebrated i would say so too i also i think on that note one of my follow-up questions for that is i think for the future of your channel do you ever see yourself wanting to potentially travel to any of these cities i think large or small kind of hole in the wall or not yeah absolutely i my my business plan that i had made when i quit my my teaching job to do this full-time was all about me like traveling at least once a month to go do a field shoot and then like a month later kovit happened and so here we are of course so i'm i'm so i'm so jazzed for everybody to get the damn vaccine and i can start you know getting on a plane and going places and putting my camera on things because i'm really sick of putting my camera on things within these four walls and people within these four walls i'm sick of myself is basically what it boils down to really tired of editing this face i look forward to editing your face lauren i think that i definitely think about that because i've just been i've been watching youtube since i was six years old i'm truly like one of the people that grew up on youtube and so i'm like i can't imagine editing myself like for probably what dozens of hours like you know every month anyway it's super weird and it's one of the worst parts of the job like it's it's like because especially like i mean i think if if you're a person who's really really into your appearance maybe that's not so torturous but like i'm someone who has tried to ignore my my physical appearance most of my life right um on the other hand i think in some ways it's actually helped me like bust through some barriers there i can see that what do they call that like immersion therapy for phobias you know like if you're scared of spiders drop them in a pit of spiders right like i have been dropped into a pit of spiders having to edit my own damn face on the other hand it has also made me more self-conscious about certain other things because it's like when you when you look at footage of yourself taken at least once a week every week you see how much your appearance actually like vacillates and changes on a moment-to-moment basis like in particular in response to like i've learned how much your appearance or at least my i shouldn't universalize my experience but i mean how much my appearance changes in response to what i've eaten in the last 24 hours or so right like if i've had a lot of pizza i you know between the water retention from the sodium and the glycogen from the um you know the excessive carb intake like my cheeks just swell up like balloons you know and i look and people will people will comment on my on my videos and be like oh hey you know oh adam boy he's been eating too many brownies or the inverse boy adam's looking shredded and it's like dude my body composition is like identical it's just the only difference is how much junk i ate in the last 24 hours if i ate a lot of junk in the last 24 hours i'm puffy if i didn't i'm not and i think that's probably true for everyone but we're just not aware of it because we don't normally have to contemplate our own faces as much as i have to contemplate mine no that's really interesting and i think speaking of i guess then like kind of like food trends because i know healthy food and like things like that like appearance perceiving ourselves i feel like that's definitely big right now especially on tick tock so i guess in one or at least like in a couple words what do you think about these few food trends i have uh i have three of them do you think they're overrated or underrated so first i have sous-vide and then also air fryers and just the general concept of superfoods sous-vide i think i'm going to say overrated um i think a lot of the which is not to say that sous-vide isn't good like sous-vide is really good it has lots of advantages but i also think that a lot of the things that are good about sous-vide are good about stewing and poaching generally right like it doesn't have to be in a bag i agree unfortunately i think this is chiefly about meat i mean sous-vide's primary utility is meat so i'm going to talk about meat um you know like one of the great things about meat about sous-vide for cooking meat is that it's like you can you know you wrap up a piece of meat you can stick it into a water bath with an immersion circulator maintaining a constant temperature and then it's it's physically impossible to overcook it you set the temperature of the water to like 140 fahrenheit or whatever like target internal temperature you have for your for your meat and it'll it and it because of the laws of thermodynamics like the the temperature inside the meat cannot exceed the temperature outside the meat and once it comes to thermal equilibrium right so and that's awesome that's great but that has been true of poaching forever forever right poaching is a great and easy way to cook now if you have a gas stove it's pretty easy to maintain at constant temperature with with a resistance coil you've got the the cycling on and off thing to kind of uh contend with so you could have spikes in temperature but generally especially if you're using a heavy bottomed pot like that sort of heavy the mass of the pot serves as a kind of regulator valve on those fluctuations of heat from the cycling resistance coil and as a result like you can maintain a pretty damn steady temperature of 140 in your poaching liquid in the pot like it doesn't have to be in a bag just put the meat in a pot with some liquid it's great it's been great for thousands of years like do you want to weigh in lauren go ahead no i just i've seen it blow up and like just even like sous vides that were like the immersion um cookers that were on online have like they've really gone down in price i feel like people like everywhere like i gotta get my hands on one so i was just wondering because i know it's great for people that are maybe afraid of meat but i'm not afraid of handling meat so well i hadn't thought of it that dimension of it lauren until you said it just now is that like it it's sanitizing right it's like for people for people who are increasingly divorced from the messy realities of our life as corporeal beings right like the yeah it's like we people want shrink-wrapped everything nowadays and and and sous-vide is part of that broader phenomenon i had not considered that until you said it and then i guess the next one is just the air fryer um i refuse to say the name because i think the name is dumb it is a tabletop convection oven is what it is but strip that away and i think they're awesome and if i was if i were you lauren like if i was a college student i think i would be that would be my chief axe right like i i would cook primarily with my air fryer if i was only feeding myself or and maybe one other person most of the time in a small space without much money a hundred percent i would be using my tabletop convection oven okay nice yeah i haven't gotten one just because my apartment is literally so small and i have no more um counter space to put another appliance the coffee machine is uh my main concern a person has to have priorities i mean really yeah i definitely want to get one probably post grad we'll see we'll see um and then the next one i think is just super foods because i definitely got into them at one point i feel like again youtube food media and then now i'm thinking to myself okay maybe i should just you know eat what i want what are you thinking um what what kinds of things were you seeking out and eating on the basis of their superness well i'm thinking about things like goji berries maca powder the hemp seeds of the world all of those sorts of things that cost like 15 dollars that you have to order online um it's such a complicated topic because like each one of these things is its own thing and some of their their sort of super reputations are more substantiated by available research than others right um you know but i also i think it's the in general i mean i think there's some good things about the trends in the sense that it's good to sort of have some kind of impetus to expose yourself to something new to go outside your comfort zone and try something that you wouldn't have normally right that's always good um um but like it's from from the millions of conversations i have all the time with all kinds of food and nutrition professionals scientists physicians etc etc it's like you know they all will most of them will say the same thing which is that it's just people that it all causes people to lose the forest for the trees right people will think like oh i'm gonna have like this purple food that has antioxidants in it and i'm gonna really seek it out right while i continue to like shove other carcinogens down my throat you know like well like like it's it's the the benefits that you're gonna get from the acai berry or whatever is really really tiny compared to the detriment you're doing by eating you know fast food and drinking alcohol right like like like and i love to drink alcohol i think alcohol is awesome right but alcohol is bad for you like the i th the the clear scientific consensus is like there's no healthy amount okay it has no um the whole all the you know studies that you might have read in the past about um alcohol like drinkers living longer and being healthier like those were studies that did not sufficiently disentangle drinking from other behaviors like having friends and doing things that are fun right which those things do make you live longer and they are correlated with drinking alcohol but it's not the alcohol that's making you live longer it's the friends that you make it's the social support system that you build it's the the fact that you give yourself time to relax and all that kind of stuff or that you have the privilege to relax right um so like any like alcohol is like class one carcinogen right and i drink it anyway because life is choices and choices are where we balance competing interests right um and i think you don't it's it's there's there's persuasive arguments to be made for not always doing the healthiest thing right like i mean that that video that i just did about uh john harvey kellogg and like his entire philosophy of self-denial that um really i think crossed the line into masochism i mean quite quite clearly right sadism really yeah and uh not only in terms of his treatment of himself but also his treatment of his patients right um and so like yeah like longevity is not the only goal right who wants to live forever if life is hell right um if like the logic is well i can completely have a hellish experience with for these 80 years or whatever that i'm alive but then i get to have have a fantastic eternity like that's that's that's a reasonable argument right assuming that you believe that that afterlife exists but if you don't then it makes no sense at all so anyway go back get back to your question lauren your excellent question i think it's like you know what all of these professionals would tell you and what they have told me anytime i've asked them about this kind of stuff is like please do not get focused on that kind of crap because it's going to keep you from paying attention to like what's actually really affecting what what the much bigger and more important parts of your diet that definitely makes sense okay and then i think just be quickly because i also am interested in continuing the conversation regarding just like honestly meat and meat taboos and all those things but before we get to that i'm actually really interested like just because speaking of this hell that we're living in right now in this pandemic in this moment i'm wondering as a sad college student what do you think should be the building blocks for people that are struggling to feed themselves right now and not in like uh in both a financial i guess and just a depression deployment well this may sound to be in contradiction with what we were just talking about but like i based upon like my my analytics and where i see like my views are coming from the countries and and all that kind of the demographics it's like i i operate on the assumption that most of the people hearing my voice are voices right now you and me lauren most the people hearing us are people who have a problem of eating too much food as opposed to too little food right i assume that most of you are kind of overfed first worlders like like me um and so if you're not please ignore what i'm about to say because it doesn't apply to you um but if you are um you know and i think i'm i'm complicit in perpetuating this the whole kind of concept of like comfort eating um is really that's that's like that's overrated that's an overrated food trend right um over overeating usually like makes us less happy um and it it you know we feel like it's going to and it often does in the very immediate sense but um but eating too much damn food and too much unhealthy damn food you know like there's large volumes of research showing it like it makes us less happy not just because of like body image and all that kind of crap but like in terms of like more immediate kind of biochemical ways like the insulin response that we get from having way too many refined carbs in one sitting like that makes you ornery and and cranky right um that's like a real thing um that i i know i experience a whole lot like if i have a whole bunch of sugar in a couple hours i feel i i feel bad i feel um like emotionally bad um and then it gets you and then you go like hypoglycemic and like and you feel sort of bad physically too and then you what do you do you eat more sugar in order to satisfy that temporary need and thus you're you're on the carb train right and you can't get off it's this addictive cycle that is really akin to all kinds of other addictive cycles that people uh suffer from in their lives and so you know honestly like my advice is like try to get away from that kind of comfort eating thing like eat a little bit more of an uh and be a bit more of an aesthete right like i i've been eating a lot better for the last couple of weeks and i feel way better psychologically right now than i did before and i don't i have to i don't know how many times i have to go through that kind of yo-yoing in my life before i freaking remember that and figure out learn the damn lesson right but like when i eat way too many way too much junk especially way too many simple carbs i am emotionally bad and when i have a cleaner diet more more fruits and vegetables and complex carbohydrates and really just kind of watching overall caloric intake i am emotionally better and and i think that like the sort of the thing that we've done in our society where like we've reacted against kind of fat shaming and fat phobia and all that kind of stuff like that's all really good and important but we also i think it's also important to not like kind of over correct a little bit and remember that like you know eating way too much junk really does do meaningfully meaningful bad things to you totally apart from like you know fascistic body image crap that we're all indoctrinated with you know yeah i definitely agree with that and especially with the whole like restrict binge cycle that a lot of people find themselves in the diet culture definitely doesn't help when people want to just comfort eat a little bit you then you feel bad about it so anyway we won't get any further into it but no that definitely makes sense yeah just kind of thinking food is fuel food is fuel am i right um but no that makes sense i think um the next thing that i was interested in because when you were talking about kind of the vegan soul food scene that was in macon those are some of my favorite restaurants here in detroit um and i was actually wondering like just your thoughts on like the way that like the vegan movement could be going in the next few years i'm really interested in the whole idea of like a flexitarian personally and like just people eating less meat in general but yeah it's it's it's it's obviously an incredibly charged subject and my goal in answering your totally fair question right now lauren is to kind of like restrict the scope of it a little bit because i don't i don't want to i mean a we could talk forever b i want to not get into too much trouble um so so i i think i think it's the case is pretty clear that less meat eating is good in almost every way it's um you know and that which is not to say that like foods that you could replace meat with in your diet aren't couldn't also be physically injurious to you and injurious to the environment and all kinds of stuff like that like they can like it matters what you replace it with in your diet but like the case is pretty you know that in aggregate if you look at what people eat instead if they reduce meat or like it's it's a good thing for them physically and for uh for the sustainability of agriculture right um so eating less meat is something that i have you know strived to do for for many years and have succeeded like we way less meat than than we used to um and try to look at it as a special treat rather than a staple food or um looking at alternatively looking at it the way that meat eating has historically been for like most of the history of civilization where like meat is more of a flavoring right and in fact you see this in lots of extant food cultures today especially in um you know east asia and some other places where it's just like the or like i mean why am i looking a field right here in the american south like the ham hock in the pot of greens is the perfect example right um where where meat is used to kind of to help cook and to help flavor very very large volumes of plant matter very very small amounts of meat and that's like that's a perfectly good you know great way to eat too and a lot of those foods are really good and kind of kind of underrated i think the whole like giant slab of pure animal protein thing is kind of a historical aberration and and and and really should be viewed as a special treat i think i think the case for that is super strong um in terms of like veganism in particular i don't know it's that's a more kind of complicated topic and i'm sort of more interested to know what you make of it lauren um well this is like really funny because um at school um before the pandemic i was actually in a vegan vegetarian co-op i myself am not vegan or vegetarian and nor do i plan on ever going vegan or vegetarian but it really introduced me to a bunch of like produce and like just other plant proteins that i never tried before like i just didn't really grow up eating things like lentils and fennel and things like that so it was all like farm fresh and local so kind of cool and it was dirt cheap which is really why i participated um but um but no it was really cool so but i think like a lot of people they would talk about things like animal rights and stuff at the like at the co-op but i remember just being like you know i definitely feel where you're coming from but you know that's just won't be me but i think that i weigh less meat on average than i did you know before i started college and i feel like if everyone made that transition maybe things would be better it's interesting to hear what you say about how like it forced you to kind of open up to new ideas and and that's something that like you see both from like a from a culinary standpoint and from like a human health standpoint is that like when people go on any kind of restricted diet they cut out x whatever the hell x is interesting and usually good things happen right um they you know it just it causes you so it's just cutting out one category of food reduces some amount of temptation in your life right like when you're just kind of walking around and there's i mean this is not a good example for covid times but in the before times when there would be like buffets or parties or just like food out somewhere if you have told yourself that you cannot eat some broad category of stuff that might be found on that table right the the the the likely outcome is that your your tot your net intake of food is going to be lower so basically any what they find you know a lot of the research finds is that basically any kind of diet restricted diet works um in terms of you know in terms of um in terms of weight loss um and so that's an interesting example there and then from the culinary culinary perspective yeah like anything that you do any arbitrary thing that you cut out is going to force you to kind of look around for things to replace it and you can discover all kinds of great things that you just had no idea that you would have liked but they're great and your and your life is richer for them so it's good to hear that you've had that experience yeah no it was definitely cool i think that like more people should learn about or at least more like americans at least i feel like should learn about the power of beings and just like kind of rediscovering different ways to have them so no that's definitely where i was coming from with that i feel like now i know about so many different foods that i didn't even know about so that's kind of where that was coming from and then oh yes the next thing that i was interested in because people also i know americans also i feel like it's like beef poultry and pork are like the main things that people eat here and i was wondering what your thoughts are on like other all like alternative meats just like how people in other cultures have them and kind of the like people rag on other cultures for the animals that they eat yeah it's such an interesting topic that i've thought of several kind of video days that i want to do video ideas that i want to do that are down that rabbit hole um all of the the weird taboos um and all that kind of stuff and how how did we land historically how did we land on beef chicken pork as like the big three in the united states um and it's like and the thing is that it's like mo you know from from having studied the topic a little bit like you know it's ask yourself why people eat what they do where they do usually it's because it's what grows well there right or it's what you can produce efficiently wherever the hell they are that's almost always cause number one for why people eat what they do and the exception and this is not at all an exception here with the case in the united states that like you know cows are are relatively economical to raise here as our chickens as our pigs um and so that's like the chief thing but yeah it's also about like kind of taste and certainly um you know the the meat industry certainly showed a trajectory toward less intensely tasting meats for a long time right um like i i wonder how many people watching this right now who have heard the term gamey in reference to the taste of meat like even know what that is like can you can you conjure a taste memory in your head about what gaming this is i mean can you lauren um i think like i definitely have like a spectrum of gamier meets that i've had so i mean again are they even gamey i don't know but i think of like rabbit or like um you know like kind of like goat or something like that when i think of gamier meats yeah yeah yeah but like but like a lot of people watching this right now have never had duck or goat right um and i wonder if they could even know what what meat can taste like when it's not the kind of meat that has had a lot of it's specifically it's odorants um kind of bred out of it basically um yeah i i remember i had a really formative experience about that um when i was sometime in my 20s i forgot what it was but i i i was cooking thanksgiving dinner and i went to like this hipster butcher shop and i was like all right yeah give me like the heritage breed turkey and the dude was like sure like he's like he looked at this boy and he was like it was like can you are you sure you can handle this young man right um and and i was like oh hell yeah right like and i cooked it and like the the smell that it felt filled the house with was like incredible and i thought that i'd done something wrong i thought that you know i'd accidentally left the liver in there or something like that you know um but no like that's gaminess and um and those are specifically they're not they're like odor compounds that like have that breeders of of of meat animals have selected against not just recently but for generations um and that's interesting um especially considering that like while some of them you know i don't like some of them i love like freaking love sheep like mutton the meat of an adult sheep freaking amazing like goat oh my god i love it and i feel like we're missing out on on not having a lot of that um you know quickly available here though it's like it's really people you know hey of course you can get everything on the internet nowadays but there's there's an expense in having it shipped to you um it's you know it's if you have not been to um local non-western markets in your community please go and and try and like look in the froze

particularly quick and easy way to make bangers and mash there's just 30 minutes between us and this classic comfort food of the anglo-celtic isles and it could easily be meatless there's great plant-based sausages on the market now and my gravy is not going to be based on a meat stock but on this shockingly delicious yeast extract i'm using half a kilo just over a pound of yukon gold potatoes for two portions i usually don't peel varieties with smooth papery skins like this they don't bother me and there's a lot of nutrition in there just clank those up into small chunks so they'll boil quickly in the pot they go cover with water and the lid so it comes to a boil faster over high heat sausage these are ostensibly irish bangers i usually prefer smaller bangers than these little bangers cook quicker and get more brown surface area proportionally i say use absolutely any fresh sausage you like i do this with spicy italian sausages all the time and for the classic onion gravy i gotta use a shallot instead a big one like this or a couple smaller ones for a couple portions shallots have much thinner layers so we can caramelize them a lot faster than other onions especially if we slice them very thin too a little oil in the pan get it heating a little less than medium i'd say and in the shallots go the potatoes are boiling lid off so it doesn't bubble over the key to caramelizing onions is to never stop stirring them if you do the ones on the bottom are going to go crispy while the ones on top are still white you got to cook them very evenly by moving them which is fine because we have nothing else to do right now in this process and because these are shallots it only takes five or six minutes to get them like that that's good enough i'm just gonna push them all over to the far side of the pan and it's time to drop a banger one big one like this per person is enough i think don't forget to nudge those shallots a little bit to make sure they aren't burning on the bottom in fact i'm gonna push my pan over so they're literally off the heat and i like to get as much browned area on the sausage casings as possible you can roll them over hold them there for a second until they stick to the pan then let go and or you can just roll them around continuously this works just like constantly flipping a steak works the crust gradually builds all over i've been browning these for about seven minutes again over medium medium low heat so i don't burn the fond which i will now deglaze from my gravy i'm just using water we have plenty of sweetness in there already from the caramelized onions and we're gonna get plenty of meaty flavor from marmite a byproduct of the british brewing industry i think it tastes a little weird by itself but a giant spoonful of it is great in gravy it's packed with glutamates all the umami you could need for thickening i'm going to use cornstarch the trick with this is to make a slurry first i've got a couple of tablespoons there and a little water and just use your finger to stir that around and smoosh any little lumps you feel in there we might use all this we might not you gotta stir as you drizzle it in or it'll clump hopelessly it thickens as soon as it approaches a boil thicken your gravy as much as you want i tend to overshoot the mark because it's easier to water it down again later and i like having a lot of gravy grind in a whole bunch of pepper and lastly i'm going to put a big spoonful of english mustard in there if you don't like mustard i would do a splash of vinegar you need something to brighten this up give it a taste the marmite is salty so we only need a little more salt and now we can just let those sausages simmer in the gravy until they're cooked inside everything is done all at the same time in one pan now we got a bunch of green onions here because the flavor of mash i'm making today is known in ireland as champ it's mash filled with green onions i'm slicing them very thin in the white area because those parts need more cooking as i get up into the greens i'll cut wider pieces potatoes are starting to fall apart when i poke at them time to drain them through the pot lid as big a knob of butter as you can live with a conservative splash of milk and a pinch of salt for starters get that all mashed up add more milk if it's too thick then in goes all of those green onions i don't know if it's traditional to use this much for a couple of portions but i love it i want it to be like coal cannon but with onions instead of cabbage the heat of the potatoes will cook these a bit knock back some of the pungency but they'll still be a little crunchy which i love it serves as the green vegetable of the meal need some more salt and that's good onto the plate with a big well in the center for gravy you can just cut into the sausage to make sure it's cooked through or take its temperature 160 fahrenheit 70c and time for that hot hot gravy shot for some reason i like the more translucent look of cornstarch with bangers in match as opposed to making a roux with flour that is a champion winter weeknight meal right there assembled in 30 minutes the

***AMERICAN CHEESE RECIPE, SERVES 2-3***

Ingredients:...",29:02.6, in mexican-american restaurants particularly in the southern u.s they serve this cheese dip simply called queso dip or queso blanco it is truly the milk of the goddess i'm going to show you one way they make it in the restaurants then i'm going to show you a couple other ways that you might make it instead there's only a few core ingredients for liquid i found i get the best taste and texture with evaporated milk that is milk that has had some of its water boiled away at low temperature in a vacuum pan i think some people use cream instead that's good regular milk or water have yielded disappointing results for me i recommend this evaporated milk about 100 ml half a cup doesn't need to be precise then cheese monterey jack cheese is the classic mexican american cheese but lots of semi-firm cheeses could work cheddar would be fine and it would melt faster if i graded it but i don't feel like getting the greater dirty so i'm just tearing in chunks i've got maybe 100 or 120 grams of that four ounces or so then the key ingredient american cheese or any kind of processed cheese slice held together with emulsifying salts in this case sodium phosphate others might use sodium citrate i believe the white colored american cheese is more commonly used for this i'm just tearing in like three slices to start with 50 or 60 grams some restaurants probably use only american cheese that'd be fine but there's enough sodium phosphate in here to emulsify some jack cheese in there as well if you can't get processed cheese slices keep watching i have multiple solutions for you a little knob of butter in there for extra richness that's optional and obviously skip it if you're using cream now i'll just turn the heat on like medium high and be sure to stir this as it melts if you don't stir the emulsion will not form you'll end up with fat floating on top of water lots of so-called copycat recipes for restaurant style queso dip tell you to use starch to stabilize and thicken this stuff usually cornstarch if you did that you would not need those emulsifying salts but the result is really disappointing in my opinion you get a gross powdery texture as opposed to this unnaturally smooth and gooey texture that you only get with modern science i think it needs some more salt to work as a dip and obviously you could stir in any herbs or spices that you want the mexican place that lauren and i go to in georgia stops right here the place my mother-in-law goes to in tennessee flavors the dip with this some kind of canned or pickled green chili any kind works but you can tell that place up in tennessee is only mixing in the juice they must use the solid chili bits for something else you get that chili flavor and a little acidity without disrupting the smooth texture but now you've added some water so you might want to thicken it back up a little bit with more cheese remember it'll thicken a lot as it cools if you overshoot the mark you can just stir in some more liquid and that's done truly milk of the goddess that is a skin will form on the surface as it cools totally normal and it'll dissolve right back in again if you stir it oh like my

thank you warby parker now these recipes i'm giving you in the description make two dishes about this size of queso so it's enough for like two or three people you could obviously multiply for a party now the obvious alternative to making queso dip with processed cheese slices is to order your own emulsifying salts online this is sodium citrate i use it all the time and once you have it this is definitely the easy way i'm just tearing in maybe 200 grams of jack cheese more this time because now we're not using the american cheese about half a teaspoon of sodium citrate two or three grams doesn't have to be precise and then like half a cup of evaporated milk again about a mls be sure to stir as it melts ions from the emulsifying salts replace ions in the casein proteins in the cheese and milk and some more science stuff happens and then boom a silky gooey emulsion starch does not do that taste it might not need any salt because the sodium citrate is salty flavor it however you want then it's done but what if you don't want to order a whole thing of sodium citrate well you can make some at home by combining citric acid from lime juice and sodium bicarbonate baking soda this absolutely does work i'm just juicing like three of these limes i need 40 or 50 mls maybe a third of a cup or a little more it's all a guess because this is a natural product we can't know exactly how much citric acid is in here but i'll stir in like half a teaspoon of sodium bicarb two or three grams and watch science happen at first this reaction creates carbon dioxide and some water stirring helps dissolve everything and it pops the bubbles before this bubbles over on you once it's done foaming it's really cold because science and i think the reactions that get you sodium citrate keep happening over a few minutes after the foaming is over i get better results if i let this keep doing whatever it's doing for like five minutes during which time you might turn on the heat and boil off some of the extra water we've introduced here just don't take it too far if it reduces to the point where it starts to brown it tastes pretty gross now i'll put in like 80 ml of evaporated milk just a little less to account for the moisture already in there and don't worry about the acid curdling the milk the acid doesn't exist anymore it's been neutralized in goes about 200 grams of jack cheese again seven or eight ounces stir and heat until smooth please do not ask me whether we've created trisodium citrate or monosodium citrate i have no idea this is hardly precise chemistry we're doing here i just know that i've done this a bunch of times and it works beautiful gooey emulsion again doesn't need any additional salt we've got sodium from the baking soda and i'll go ahead and stir in the chili chunks with the pickling juice this time and maybe some cilantro you could do diced tomatoes olives all kinds of things go in here now does that have some noticeable lime flavor in it yes it does is that a bad thing i don't think so this is my favorite batch of the three get some tortilla chips and try it yourself
Rolled chicken breasts with chorizo stuffing and green beans,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EWgezGndMMU/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLAeK4ysB5xytH7Yoo24ekOhCJ1UuA,EWgezGndMMU,"7 minutes, 34 seconds","Thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this video! Go to Squarespace.com for a free trial, and when you’re ready to launch, go to http://squarespace.com/ragusea​ and add code “RAGUSEA""...",29:02.6, this video is sponsored by squarespace so this is a little bit of work but it's a fun way to make the chicken breast interesting again just make a quick stuffing and roll it up i'm making two big portions and i'm starting with like a 50 gram chunk of dry chorizo you could use any sausage at all but if you're using fresh sausage not dried you'd want almost twice as much because it'll boil off water the key with the dry sausage for stuffing is cutting it into the smallest pieces possible i'm just sawing thin strips and from there saw into matchsticks and from there saw into a fine dice i do find a back and forth sawing motion works much better than a chopping motion with dry sausage man i love chorizo smoky garlicky red flavored i don't know it's awesome the iberian peoples know from sausage and here's a shallots any form of onion is fine but we only need a little and shallots are small so one shallot very fine grab a pan and i'll throw those in cold and turn the heat on medium underneath them fat will render out of the sausage in time to cook the shallots i'll just stir those every now and then meanwhile i can prep my chicken one side of a breast per person and it's time to butterfly them i'm just cutting into the thickest parts very carefully and open it up i'll show you that from the side heading into the thickest part trying to cut its height in half stop before you go all the way through and open it up like a book if you've got thick parts you can kind of make slits across them and or lay some plastic over to prevent splattering while you pound them out focusing your attention on the thick parts the thin parts will need hardly any smashing for years before i had this meat pounder i used a heavy bottomed pint glass that's fine as long as you don't hulk smash it i'll just get the meat as flat as i can without tearing it apart done back over at the stuffing the shallots look pretty cooked if using fresh sausage you'd want to get it looking pretty dry and crumbly now i'll pour in a roughly equal quantity by volume of breadcrumbs this is panko because that's pretty much the only kind i keep around anymore but any breadcrumb is fine i've done this with cornbread crumbs before that was amazing i'll just let that toast a little for flavor and then it's time to deglaze the pan these mini bottles of white wine are quite convenient for cooking you could use water with maybe a splash of vinegar at the end to taste instead there's still some brown stuff over there to get off i want that flavor but i also want enough moisture in the pan to make the breadcrumbs moldable just barely moldable off the heat that comes and since i'm going to have my chicken with lemon i might as well put a little zest in the stuffing it really freshens up the chorizo as will a bunch of fresh herb i'm using dill because i have some and i like it but thyme or parsley would be great stir that up taste it it only needs a little more salt because the chorizo is so heavily seasoned very nice still crumbly if it was really wet it would be kind of gummy in the end and before i roll this up i'm going to do myself a favor and cut a bunch of strands of butcher's twine get it done now while my hands are clean each piece is long enough to wrap around the chicken and tie a knot and i'd say five strands per piece keep those scissors we'll need them again now stuffing onto the cut side of each piece of meat this piece is a little bit bigger so i'll need a little more keep that pan we're going to use it again this is a one pan dinner and then whichever side is more tattered is the one i want to hide inside the roll so stuffing all the way to that end and then roll it up i've left a little strip uncovered there at the end to make a seal done and because we topped the cut side of the meat the firmer and smoother surface is now the outside of the roll which is good this one is not going to work rolling in the same direction no worries i'll just roll this from the tail instead this is good because it'll get me a piece of about the same thickness even though it's smaller it'll cook in the same time there looks like a pig's trotter now i'm just going to wiggle my first length of twine underneath there and do a surgeon's knot that's where you go across and then under once that's an overhand knot and then you go under again pull taut and the extra friction we get from going under twice holds it for us while we lock it off with a normal overhand knot easy repeat i wish i could tell you that you could just secure these with a toothpick down the middle or something but that just doesn't work chicken breast is too delicate and irregular the toothpicks aren't secure enough but this isn't too hard i snip off the excess just to keep it out of my way it looks like a couple of lobster tails now and if you were making these for the in-laws or something you could do this much the night before and put them in the fridge i'm ready to cook these right now so i'll get some salt all over these pan back over medium or medium-low heat and coat with olive oil let it get hot and i'll lay in the chicken and this part would probably be easier in a non-stick pan in a stainless pan you got to really let each surface sear firm before you nudge it off the pan or else it'll shred i'm getting a little bit of shredding whatever i'm just gently coloring all sides and at this point you could throw the pan in the oven i would only do that if my oven was already hot for something else instead you could throw some butter in the pan melted and just kind of roll them around in there i think that does the same thing as basting it just doesn't look as sexy but it still takes a long time to get the inside of these up to temperature for this particular recipe i found the best things to cover them you don't have a lid some foil is fine just let them steam in there the rest of the way check on them frequently and roll them around about 15 minutes after they went in this smaller one is approaching 160 fahrenheit 70 c i actually wished i'd pulled these a little sooner carry overheat is going to raise these like 10 degrees fahrenheit as they rest unless you really need to play it safe i'd say pull these no further than 155 or 68c those can just rest while we make our side i'm dumping out any burned bits of stuffing that fell out and the butter if it's looking burned but that fond on the bottom is looking golden and perfect so back on the heat it goes and in goes a bunch of green beans i think that was a six ounce bag 170 grams they taste even better if you let them fry a little bit in the dry heat i should have done that a little bit longer but eventually you got to deglaze i'm using the rest of my mini bar bottle there again water would be fine with a little splash of vinegar at the end instead just scrape that pan clean get all those beans coated and on goes my makeshift lid heat up to high just let them steam maybe five minutes but check on them frequently because if too much of that liquid evaporates it'll burn instantly i'm just tossing in some water whenever needed keep steaming taste one to check for doneness and seasoning some pepper and salt and a little more thyme the easiest way to get these strings off is to snip them with clean scissors and then peel them off get rid of them this is not necessary but some fresh butter in the green beans at the very end is nice just to make a thicker sauce with the panju off the heat now it's really important to slice this up with a freshly sharpened knife otherwise the meat fibers will just shred you'll have done all this decorative work for nothing but look how pretty those are little meaty pinwheels when it's time to transfer this to the plate you can just kind of mash it back together press and lift and deposit fan those out a little to show off get those green beans this is my new favorite thing cooking my vegetable in the pan with the fond while the meat rests synergistic and then last and not optional at all in my opinion is a lemon wedge this is the sauce for the chicken gotta have it get that darn seed out of my thumbnail you know it's not an everyday dinner but it's a fun little project and a way to get creative with chicken breast you could stuff it with all kinds of things and those green beans glisten like a new website from squarespace just like that chicken squarespace has everything you

"The argument for cooking with volume measurements, rather than weight",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/04ID_Qdm1Q8/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLBQS5Wm6cE-LzC1SMpC6fGfq1XYXQ,04ID_Qdm1Q8,17 minutes,"Become smarter in 5 minutes by signing up for free today: https://cen.yt/mbadamragusea2 — Thanks to Morning Brew for sponsoring this video!

My old video about why the U.S. hasn't fully adopted...",29:02.6, in the home kitchen i think that measuring ingredients by volume is good i think measuring ingredients by weight is also good i could easily make that argument but everybody makes that argument these days don't they the celebrity chef phenomenon has taken tons of methods and values from the professional kitchen and it's foisted them upon the home kitchen where i think many of those methods have limited applicability the pros like to measure by weight i like to measure by volume and i have five reasons for that or possibly six we'll get to that but first we need to establish that this is not a metric versus imperial debate all widely used measurement systems in the whole world have units of volume and units of weight you totally can measure out a hundred milliliters of flour even though nobody does that most people watching this in the metric world right now i would probably call this about 50 grams of flour likewise the united states system of customary measurements that evolved here from the british imperial system has both weight and volume measurements we got them both i would call this half a cup of flour but you could call it about two ounces of flour the ounce is a unit of weight not to be confused with the fluid ounce which is a unit of volume that is legit confusing a cup is eight fluid ounces a fluid ounce is the volume that would be occupied by one ounce of water by weight roughly that volume or an ounce of wine in merry old england just a fun historical fact there but anyways yes it's absolutely true that people here in the united states are more likely to measure stuff by volume than say our peers over in europe who pretty much all have kitchen scales but that fact is not inherent to our respective systems of measurement you can do weight or volume in either system so why is volume still kind of popular here in the states as far as i can tell nobody knows but here's a hypothesis from dr stephen mim a historian at the university of georgia who is working on a book about the history of measurement systems in the us in the early 20th century the the federal government created something called the bureau of standards it fanned out across the country and it did a bunch of tests on shopkeepers and restaurants and places where people were using measures and that you know how much does this pint really measure and they actually knew how much a pine was supposed to be and they found that every single measure almost without exception was off oftentimes to the detriment of people buying things at the deli counter or at a grocery twas ever thus right there is ample record of merchants in ancient rome cheating their customers out of a libra of barley or whatever cursed you affidious fortis i want my silver quinari back measuring by weight is harder to scam as long as you have an authority or regulator who calibrates the scales and measuring by cup or you know other volumetric measures can be fiddled with in a variety of very interesting and creative ways that retailers have have honed over millennia and so in the united states the government has been i would say a little less willing to step into that kind of granular regulation whereas in europe it's there's a more of a tradition of that that cultural and constitutional resistance to top-down government regulation here in the u.s might also explain at least somewhat why we are the only major economy in the whole world that has yet to fully adopt the metric system for more about that history see my earlier video with dr mim that is linked in the description it's certainly the case that measuring by volume is much more technologically simple manufacturing a vessel of relatively uniform size is a lot easier than manufacturing even the most primitive scale cheap mass-produced scales were not widely available until the turn of the 20th century it's only around then that we start to see recipes written by weight in any country if you look at recipes from the early 19th century they'll say things like put in the amount of flour equivalent in size to you know a large egg you know like what does that mean so i wonder if maybe the sudden transition to metric that so many countries went through in the 20th century maybe that provided them with an opportunity for a reset when you're throwing out your ancient system of measurements it's not much harder to go a little bit further and throw out your ancient system of measuring things by volume and a scale is only one new piece of gear to buy as opposed to a whole new set of volume measures a scale is one thing to buy my little hypothesis is that we in the united states by resisting metrification we have denied ourselves the opportunity for that kind of society-wide reset and as a result we're still cooking with methods that were developed by pioneer ladies who were measuring out the ingredients for their cake with a tea cup because that's all the gear they had and it doesn't even matter because you have died of dysentery as we've discussed here previously americans have been quietly adopting metric for decades now maybe not so much in the kitchen but in science and in industry and if you want to keep up to date on the latest in business tech or finance consider signing up for morning brew the sponsor of this video morning brew is a totally free newsletter that comes to your email every morning instead of aimlessly doom scrolling through twitter which is something i used to have a very bad habit of doing now i get caught up on the day's events far more efficiently morning brew takes five minutes to read through i used to work in news and now i try kind of hard to avoid the news for mental health reasons which is good in some ways but bad in the sense that i often find myself wondering why is everyone talking about jeff bezos in gamestop it's nice to have morning brew just explain it to me they write in this very breezy funny voice that is similar to the voice in my own head and they make their copy skimmable maybe i don't want to know the whole deal with gamestop i just want to know the bottom line it's completely free and subscribing takes 15 seconds do us both a favor and sign up with my link in the description thank you morning brew anyway professional kitchens especially bakeries use weight and when you switch over to weight it's only natural to switch over to metric as well because the ounce is too big for cooking a single ounce is almost 30 grams and 10 or 20 grams of flour can make a real difference in a recipe ounces don't offer you a fine enough scale and yeah fractions and decimals exist but whole numbers are easier to read and so american bakers have been switching to metric for many decades now metric weights are better for cooking i wouldn't dispute that my argument here is not against metric it has nothing to do with metric my argument is in favor of measuring stuff in the kitchen with volume regardless of what units you use and here's reason number one volume is visible weight is not we feel weight with our sense of touch we cannot see weight what we see is the volume of space that the item takes up you might think you know what 200 grams of cheese looks like but you don't right what you have is an association you know from experience how much space a 200 gram block of cheese generally occupies and you're doing a volume to weight conversion in your head when you look at it you think oh that looks like about 200 grams of cheese to me this does not have to be your goal but my goal in the kitchen is to measure things as little as possible i think it's a lot quicker and easier and more fun to just eyeball stuff a little bit of this a little bit of that and i think that human beings are just much more naturally suited to judging kitchen type quantities by eye rather than by feel of weight so if you want to cook by eye i think it makes more sense to just stay in the world of volume most of the time rather than doing volume to weight conversions in your head one reason why professional kitchens like to work with weights is that the pros are dealing with huge quantities it's really really hard to intuitively tell the difference between this and this by eye whereas like it's pretty easy to tell the difference between like this and this by eye down here this is the scale of objects that evolution has calibrated our sensory apparatus to judge things in this kind of range and this is the range that we're normally dealing with in the kitchen right reason number two i like volume you gotta scoop your stuff out with something you might as well scoop it out with something that gives you a rough idea of how much you have scooped i mean i know people who cook with scales sometimes do this thing where they hold the whole flour container over the bowl and just pour it in but i think that's a pain you got to do it slowly to be careful and if you're not careful you can easily start an avalanche and then i think it's easier to scoop out flour with some kind of cup and to scoop out things like baking powder with some kind of spoon you might as well do it with a cup or a spoon which helps you judge how much you have scooped this leads me to reason number three measuring by volume minimizes dishes or at least it can help you minimize dishes to measure by weight you often have to get a whole big bowl dirty you need a bowl on the scale and that bowl is dishes neutral if you're also mixing the food in that bowl but say you're mixing your stuff in a stand mixer you can't just put that on a scale while it's in the machine sure if you need to add something in halfway through your mixing process you could take it off the machine and then put it back on the scale but i think it's easier to just leave it in the machine and simply scoop in whatever you need to add and to scoop it with a scooper that helps you keep track of how much you have added and if you're mixing your stuff in a pot you can't just take the pot off the heat and put it on your scale you're going to melt your scale what you're going to do is you're going to measure your stuff in a bowl on the scale which is going to make that bowl dirty and bowls take up more space in the dishwasher than a measuring cup or a spoon now to be sure measuring by volume can definitely create way more dirty dishes if you get out a different cup or a different spoon for every darn quantity that you're measuring so you know don't do that i try to cook with exactly one cup and one spoon that's it if i need half a cup of flour just fill the cup up halfway that's easy to do because volume is visible and if i need a quarter of a teaspoon of yeast to just fill the spoon up a quarter of the way which leads us to reason number four volume is actually much more accurate with very small quantities like a quarter of a teaspoon of dry yeast is about .75 grams kitchen scales usually don't show fractions of a gram because they're not accurate with weights so light helen rennie has a terrific video about this topic it is linked in the description normal kitchen scales are accurate enough when you're talking about tens of grams but just one or two grams just try measuring out like three grams of salt you'll see the scale suddenly jump you're telling me that last grain of salt weighed a whole two grams of course not for ingredients like flour and cheese the difference of a gram or two almost never really matters in the kitchen but for ingredients like salt or yeast or like a really strong spice a difference that small really could matter and volume is better at accurately measuring those things but don't take my word for it nobody can accuse our friend kenji of being an imprecise cook the dude loves precision and as he explains in this article that is linked in the description he uses weight to measure big quantities and volume to measure very small quantities this is one reason why spoons and dashes and pinches persist in recipes even in places where people are really accustomed to using kitchen scales look at this bbc bread recipe the flour is given in grams but the salt is given in teaspoons the only reason they give the yeast in grams is because the yeast comes pre-measured seven grams is how much these envelopes hold unless you have a scale that is designed to measure fractions of a gram scales that are often marketed as jeweler's scales regardless of what substances people actually weigh on them unless you have one of those volume is more accurate than weight for very small quantities which is not to say that volume is totally accurate either a teaspoon of salt can be a very different quantity depending on the size and shape of the grains this is why you can't just go buy the recipe you got gotta taste your food put in a little salt taste it add more salt if it needs it this leads me to my fifth and final reason measuring by volume encourages you to think for yourself i'm skating on very thin ice right now i realize that i'm speaking purely from my own anecdotal experience and i'm i'm theorizing i'm guessing from my own anecdotal experience but this is what i will tell you i know that about half of you about half of my audience are here in the united states where volume is still king in the kitchen and i also know that most times when i get a dm from somebody who's having trouble with one of my recipes usually what they're having trouble with is the quantity of flour in one of my recipes most of those people in those dms that i get express their problem to me in grams and most of their problems have to do with them following my recipe to the letter instead of doing what i said to do which is to use the recipe or the quantity in the recipe as a baseline and then add more flour until it feels right this is pretty much always the advice i offer just use the measurement as a starting point and then keep putting in flour until it looks and feels the way that it's supposed to one of the beauties of teaching cooking through a medium like video is i can show you what it looks like i think i'm guessing based upon this experience that gram recipes might encourage robotic thinking a kind of paint by numbers mentality this recipe has super precise measurements so all i gotta do is just follow it to the dot and i'm gonna have a great dinner problem is it doesn't work that way for those of us in the cups and spoons world we're maybe a little more used to measurement alone being inadequate for flour in particular a cup of flour is a really different quantity depending on whether the flour is compressed or fluffed up so because i grew up in the cups and spoons world maybe i'm just a little bit more used to using the quantities in the recipe as a baseline and then using feel and judgment to take it the rest of the way if you measure your flour by grams you're more likely to get away with just cooking by measurement and never using your own senses or judgment but there can still be problems 50 grams of flour will absorb more or less water depending on what kind of flour it is it's protein content whether it's been bleached how finely it's been milled when professional kitchens use weight they're generally working from a recipe that has been written by a chef in-house right and that chef knows exactly what kind of flour they're working with that chef knows exactly how that oven they have there behaves the test cooks at the bbc don't know about your flour or your oven or how salty you like your bread we all have to think for ourselves in our kitchens i'm hypothesizing that if you resign yourself to using a more imprecise measure like a cup to measure flour then you're more likely to use your head and your hands instead instead of just following the recipe like a drone but i realized that the argument i just made is in conflict with the argument i made for reason number four right sorry about that if you're in school right now for sociology or psychology or cognition or maybe even like technical communication i think that you could devise an experiment to test this hypothesis you give one group of cooks a recipe with really specific quantities to the gram and you give them a scale to cook it with and then you give the other group a recipe with really kind of vague quantities on it and no scale but a recipe that gives really specific verbiage about what the thing should look like and then you just see who has a better experience whose product comes out closer to the ideal model lastly as i mentioned at the top there may be a secret sixth reason why i like volume i was born into volume right i was born into the world of cups and spoons cups and spoons is who i am and i like myself i know myself i'm comfortable with myself i don't know other people i'm not comfortable with them i fear the unknown and the world of grams is the unknown it's not who i am maybe that's why i like volume there's a lot of people in this world who believe that one culture is objectively superior to another culture and maybe they're right i don't know i just know that it's kind of a remarkable coincidence that so many of these people in fact i'd say most of these people who believe that there is one objectively superior culture just happened to have been born into that culture i mean what are the odds how lucky for you all of us have a very limited understanding of why we like what we like luckily we don't really have to understand it right especially here in the kitchen where the stakes are pretty darn low make your dinner however you like it this is why i like measuring things by volume take from that what you will

JuneShine Hard Kombucha is ridiculously refreshing, low-sugar,...",29:02.6, this is how i was finally able to enjoy gnocchi by frying them in their traditional browned butter sauce until golden they get a very crispy skin on them that's satisfying to bite through very tasty historically gnocchi are italian balls of miscellaneous starch bound into dumplings with egg and or cheese the version most popular among italian americans is flour and potato and even if you do the trick where you roll the dumpling across a fork to make lots of surface area on which sauce can cling i just think they taste like fluffy nothing so here's how i do it instead i'd say one large russet type potato for two portions of gnocchi that's about a one pound or half kilo floury potato stabbed maniacally so as to release steam while cooking i think the best way to get potato for gnocchi is to make baked potatoes for dinner the previous night but throw in an extra potato while you're at it just bake them until soft and squishy like an hour if you don't have a leftover baked potato you can just throw one in the microwave it only takes about 10 minutes in there for me to get it soft the flavor is not as good but at least it's drier than a boiled potato people do boil potatoes for gnocchi but drier potato is easier to mold into dumplings and the flavor from the baked potato is superior i think this is the baked one after it's cooled a sec i just pull the flesh out with my fingers this allows me to feel around for pieces like that that's a leathery bit of flesh from right next to the skin that had dried out we won't be able to smash that up smooth so get it out i just want the fluffy bits a ricer is a great tool for mashing this up but a fork is also fine just smoosh it until it's smooth and then i'm gonna make a little koi pond in the center where i'll put my egg just the egg yolk i'm making dinner for two and a whole egg would be too much too wet plus i think they do taste a little better when you only use yolk i say a pinch of salt per portion with dumplings this big i think the interior really does need at least a little seasoning plus some cheese on the inside this is pecorino that'll contribute some salt as well i'll just break up that yolk and then flour i think the common approach with flour and gnocchi is you put in as little as necessary to make this come together into a moldable dough i started with half a cup and ended up putting in about a full cup that's like 120 grams a lot of people emphasize working this as little as possible as soon as you put in the flour they want to keep their gnocchi soft minimize gluten development but i hate fluffy gnocchi they taste like baby food give me that chew plus for the pan frying method i'm going to show you you kind of need the gnocchi to be more solid if they're too soft they'll break apart in the pan there we go smooth not too sticky but still quite soft and squishy because of the potato it's still gonna be a dumpling not just a giant hunk of pasta this is easier to roll out and shape if you let it sit and let the flower hydrate for like 15 minutes i wish i had a drink oh i do check out june shine the sponsor of this video yes i'm advertising hard kombucha in a gnocchi video won't be the first time i baffle somebody's nona kombucha naturally wants to ferment into alcohol the makers here have simply decided to not fight it and you get a product that's about six percent alcohol like beer june is a kind of kombucha june shine like moonshine get it and they make all these creative flavors look at this crazy one that color is from activated charcoal surprisingly tasty this one is citrusy june shine is gluten free unlike beer there's no artificial colors there's syrups the ingredients are 100 organic and because it's kombucha it's filled with probiotics i mean it's still an alcoholic beverage but even putting aside the health stuff it's got this beautiful complex fermented flavor june

shipping with my link in the description do us both the favor thank you joonshine now after a quick rest we're good to roll this out just roll it out into a snake when the snake gets too long cut it in half and keep rolling then the only trick to cutting these out into little pillows is to kick them away with the knife cut and kick cut and kick it's a dance craze the cut sides are extremely sticky and if two dumplings touch you'll never get them apart sounds like a parable roll out the other half and repeat this might not look like enough gnocchi for two people but this is a very heavy dinner especially with the browned butter no part of me wants to eat more than half of this and i'm not going to do the fork trick to give these pretty little ridges that would actually reduce the amount of browned surface that i could get on each dumpling i really don't care about the shape of these at all i just want bite-sized lumps of dough who cares if they're not all the same dimensions as long as they're all about the same size into a little pot of boiling water these go i do find i have to plop them in almost one at a time or else they'll stick to each other just give them a quick stir to make sure they're not sticking to the bottom and then i'll immediately throw a huge knob of butter into my non-stick pan and turn the heat on medium get it melting because these only take like two minutes to cook when they all float they're cooked enough especially because we're going to cook them a lot more in the pan i'll just drain those as dry as possible through the pot lid dry because we won't be able to brown them in here until we boil out the remaining water anyway you can do this in another kind of pan as long as you keep them moving constantly to keep them from sticking but the teflon makes it so much easier and you don't lose any crust to the bottom of the pan i've seen lots of cooks let their gnocchi brown a little in the butter i'm just taking it to the extreme when i've gotten some good color on these i'll throw in my sage totally traditional to do gnocchi and brown butter and sage i like to tear in whole leaves they fry beautifully crisp in the butter but sage is very strong don't do this unless you're sure you like sage i love it i need some more butter in there things are looking too dry once the sage leaves are crispy these are done i might give one a taste just to check for seasoning i'll toss a little more salt in there but once i get this on the plate i'm gonna cover it in grated pecorino which is very salty too i don't want the dumplings salty enough on their own if they were they'd be too salty those sage leaves are not just for garnish you gotta try eating them whole they have this delicious crumpling crispy pastry texture in the mouth now i'm not saying my gnocchi are objectively better than your nonas i'm just saying that we can all enjoy our own dinners more if we give ourselves permission to be honest with ourselves about what we like and deviate from tradition accordingly speaking of which i've had this weird idea that orange zest would be good in this orange and sage are often paired together with turkey and duck and such and yeah that is a phenomenal combination experimentation

What is brownie skin? Brownie skin investigation part I: https://youtu...",29:02.6, by combining a few less conventional techniques and ingredients we can get very chewy brownies with a glossy papery top plus a strong milky almost marshmallowy flavor from the key ingredient sweetened condensed milk get the oven heating to 325 fahrenheit 160c convection if you've got it i'm using a 9 inch square pan 23 centimeters you could go a little smaller and these are very sticky brownies so i recommend a parchment paper sling to get them out it'll sit flatter in the pan if you just snip each corner diagonally a little bit they're good enough the weight of the batter will hold it down a little pot on the stove and then goes a whole stick of butter half a cup 113 grams and turn the heat on medium i'm not a member of the browned butter cult it's not one of my favorite flavors but it works exceptionally well with the condensed milk here first you melt it then you boil out the water butter is 15 or 20 water boiling it out will allow us to brown the milk solids in here oh a tiny whisk is extremely useful for this recipe when the bubbling changes to fizzing and popping and foaming you want to make sure that you're stirring if you don't the milk solids will sink to the bottom of the pan and stick and then they won't be in our batter we want them when the butter smells kind of like caramel and you can see it just turning brown in goes half a cup of cocoa powder 50 grams i'm using dutch cocoa that's the dark kind that's in oreos but you could use any cocoa powder you want and when it's whisked in smooth let it boil in there for a minute this step intensifies the flavor of the cocoa a bit i can smell it toasting a little now and i don't want it to burn so off the heat this comes we're done with the heat time to whisk in an entire 14 ounce can of sweetened condensed milk about 400 grams make sure you get the sweetened kind the syrup in here makes these brownies very moist and chewy and there goes the lid whoops next one cup 120 grams of powdered sugar gotta be powdered sugar if you want that papery skin on this particular recipe you will still see some little particles that won't dissolve those are the browned butter solids those aren't a problem a big lug of vanilla a couple of teaspoons pinch of salt only if you used unsalted butter and then this is optional but a little glug of molasses makes the flavor more complex far too sticky to measure out a teaspoon or two i just drip a little out of the bottle that gets you the flavor of brown sugar because brown sugar is just sugar plus molasses then one solitary egg yolk the sugar and everything has lowered the temperature in here plenty so it's not going to scramble no egg white at all that would make these brownies more cakey and i've not tried it but i bet a spoon of instant espresso powder would be a nice flavor in here as well once everything is smooth it's time for flour just three quarters of a cup 160 grams all-purpose flour whisk that in smooth plus any nuts if you want those if you want solid chocolate chips set the pan aside and let it cool a bit before you stir them in or they will just melt instantly into the batter no good chilling those chips in the freezer helps to prevent that and i'll do a cup at most a wooden spoon is now pretty much the only thing strong enough to handle a batter rich and sticky as honey

to install joinhoney.com thank you honey scrape that honey bowl clean you know i bet peanut butter chips would be great with the milky flavor of these brownies i would not try to smooth this out with a spoon you might never get it back you can try thumping the pan to get it even but just don't worry about it it'll melt to an even layer in the oven this takes up to 40 minutes for me in there but every pan in every oven is different seriously different pan materials will cook brownies way faster than others look within five minutes you can see the skin forming the convection fan helps with that but that's also why we need the heat a little lower at 350 fahrenheit i find it starts burning after 20 minutes the toothpick or skewer test shows us we're nowhere close super gooey you can do that test with a knife by the way here we are after about 30 minutes and if you like your brownies really fudgy pull them at this stage when the skewer still comes out a little muddy if you like them chewier keep baking this is 35 minutes not totally clean those will be a hair fudgy i'm pulling them and they're molten now so you got to let them cool for at least a little bit this is an hour later and you can just lift them out with the paper beautiful crackly skin on those i have been investigating the science of that skin and how exactly you can make sure that your brownies will have it i believe that i've cracked the code not just for this crazy recipe but for any brownie recipe i will reveal that code on monday if you're watching this in the distant future it'll be linked in the description those are chewier than any scratch-made brownie i've ever had with a really cool caramelized milk flavor and here's a batch without any chocolate chips in them i think i prefer those the more they sit around after you've baked them the more candy like that top gets you see that one that is the thick and cakey version of this recipe same basic deal you just use the whole egg a full cup of flour and a teaspoon of baking powder both recipes are in the description i'm honestly really excited about this one it took me a lot of versions but these are my first home baked brownies that i think beat the boxed ones let me know if it works as well for you

***RECIPE***...",29:02.6, i have done many experiments and concluded that you can make a totally convincing homemade demi-gloss by simply combining these store-bought ingredients in these proportions and then just boiling them for a while that's it i swear it works and having a bag of demi-glass ice cubes in the house will turn your meat dishes into treasures for which you will weep when absent and i'm not calling this faux demi gloss or airsoft's demi-glass i'm calling it demi-glass we're just taking a very different route to that destination let's quickly recap what demigloss is no less in authority than anthony bourdain writes classically demigloss was a reduction of equal parts reduced veal stock and sauce espanol no one makes sauce espanola anymore what most restaurants refer to as demi is simply a strong dark highly reduced veal stock that has been strained and reduced again with red wine and shallots and even that last thing bourdain said would be debated by some chefs the core idea is it's a dark meat stock made with roasted bones and joints traditionally veal bones but this is chef john's much less expensive cheats that combines chicken wings and beef shanks anyway you simmer that stuff for literally a day strain it out then you gotta skim off the fat reduce the stock until it's within striking distance of this gloss or glaze meat glaze demi-glass is halfway to being glossed demi means half anyway to make this much more efficiently out of modern widely available industrial food products the first thing we need is pre-packaged broth or stock the standard one quart carton is the core unit of my recipe here a quart is just shy of a liter for each carton we'll need about one teaspoon of tomato paste so into my big pot i'm just squeezing out six approximate teaspoons for the six quarts of stock i'm going to boil down then i'm turning the heat on medium there's no fat in the pan i don't have to skim fat off this at the end i'm just going to mash that around and very gently brown the tomato paste what this step replicates is the common technique where chefs coat the veal bones in tomato paste before roasting them it gives you some nice caramelized sugar some brick red color and a lot of umami but i found that if i let this burn in the slightest it ruins the whole batch so i'm very conservative as soon as the paste stuck to the pan just starts to brown i can see it i can smell it that's good enough deglaze with the first carton make sure the bottom of the pan is clean and nothing is going to burn then in goes five more quarts use veal stock if you can find it i think chicken is fine for this and while broth is technically made of meat and stock is technically made from bones i don't think it really matters which you have for our purposes here and i'm not sure there's much of a difference with the prepackaged stuff what's imperative is that whatever you buy is low sodium the lowest salt content you can find or it'll be inevitably salty by the time you reduce it and quality matters i tried a lot of brands before i landed on this one it has hardly any salt and great flavor i tried mixing some beef broth in with the chicken to better approximate veal and it just didn't work most beef broth on the market in my world is somewhat artificially flavored and really gave the demi-gloss a canned soup taste better to use a high quality very low salt broth from the wrong animal the next thing believe it or not will be soy sauce a very small amount just a teaspoon per quart of broth low sodium soy sauce is best for this if you got it but i don't think it's worth making a special purchase trust me this will not taste like east asian food at the end this tiny amount of soy sauce will just supply a lot of the same flavor compounds we would get by roasting the bones for the stock you usually roast some onions with the bones so i'm putting in half a teaspoon of onion powder per quart of stock you could skip that honestly most pre-packaged broth products have some onion in them anyway what you cannot skip is this gelatin this is what you would dissolve out of the connective tissues of the veal bones it's why joints are especially good for demi-gloss lots of collagen in joints that break down into gelatin one standard quarter ounce packet of unflavored unsweetened gelatin per quart of broth those packets are seven grams each be aware that a lot of refined gelatin like this on the market is made from pig parts if you don't eat pig look for halal or kosher gelatin and you generally scatter this stuff on to keep it from clumping up we're putting in so much that it's going to clump no matter what but it doesn't matter the clumps just dissolve in time which is why i add this at the beginning of the process now literally all we got to do is boil this on high heat until it's about 1 6 of its original volume so all six of those boxes are going to be reduced to the volume of just one i'm going to pinch my spoon at the original liquid level then imagine cutting that length in half then imagine cutting the half into thirds and there when the liquid comes up to about there on the spoon we'll have one-sixth of the original volume as it reduces you might notice some good stuff sticking to the walls i try to scrape that off and get it dissolved again and scrape the bottom to make sure that nothing is sticking and burning but mostly i just left this boil largely unattended it'll take a couple hours plenty of time to prepare the new pan that i'm going to use in this video which is sponsored by misen and this is the new carbon steel pan from misen high carbon steel is basically a middle ground between stainless and cast iron you season it like cast iron to make a natural non-stick surface easy instructions there first step is to melt off the packing wax then just rub on the seasoning wax that misen kindly provides and in it goes to season miesen is a company that's making very solid basic essential cookware at shockingly low prices pans this cheap from other companies are never this beefy this thing is so solid it'll last a lifetime and it's heavy but not as heavy as cast iron which is one of the virtues of carbon steel it also heats faster and more evenly remove the handle there so you can easily transfer this to the oven a phenomenal all-purpose pan do us both a favor go to misen.com regucia carbon steel for 20 off your first order on this pan or anything misen dot com slash ragusia carbon steel for 20 off your first order thank you miezen here's our stock after an hour reduced halfway if you couldn't fit in all your cartons in the beginning just wait until the first few reduce a bit and then put in the rest here we are after two hours and yep that's about one-sixth of our original volume and this is done you could keep reducing it down to a thick glaze but it would be untenably sticky it's just easier to package and dose out this stuff if it's still got some water in it these are just standard ice cube trays i'm using i'd say each cube of these will enrich enough pan sauce for one person freeze those solid unpack into freezer bags and you're locked and loaded anytime you're making any kind of meat sauce or stew you just drop in a couple cubes and let them reduce from demigloss to gloss let me taste that and make a mental note that's just our prepackaged ingredients reduced nothing else now here's a couple of cubes of the demi-glace i made a while back closer to the traditional way with fresh animal parts that i bought from the store reduce that to a glaze and taste the texture of the two is identical because gelatin is gelatin regardless of what you boiled it out of the flavor is almost identical and very good in either case that touch of soy sauce over here really does replicate that taste of roasted bones now let's actually do something with it i've got a hanger steak here from rocking chair ranch in monroe county georgia i've got a video about how to trim and portion this it's in the description a couple little pseudo loins of hanger go into the pan they're coated in oil salt and pepper a good sear all around and then in goes butter and i'll just baste these on medium low heat until pink inside maybe 125 fahrenheit on a thermometer 50c out they go to rest on the board i'll deglaze with just a little red wine i don't bother putting wine or shallots or anything in my demi-glace because i want to keep my demi-glass versatile it's really easy for me to add flavorings to it later and in goes three cubes of my new demi-glass time now to just reduce this until thick look at how syrupy that is that's mostly the gelatin heat off bubbling stopped and i like to finish with just a little cold butter to make an emulsion some fresh thyme in there as well and that is done slice up my hanger steak on the plate and yeah that sauce is just insane the demi gloss gives it an instant hit of intense meaty flavor and more importantly that indescribably luscious texture you only get from gelatin all of this makes me wonder what if we cut out the middleman what if we just sprinkled some gelatin right into a pan sauce the same way you would with starch or something just to use it as a thickener in this case i've done some mushrooms with my hanger steak those mushrooms will provide a lot of that umami we would get from the reduced meat broth deglaze with red wine and a little water and then i'll just sprinkle on my gelatin you won't know what its final thickness is going to be until you let it cool to eating temperature it thickens as it cools needs a little more gelatin for thickening i'll stir in some whole sage leaves and to keep the experiment pure there's no butter at all in this pan all of that texture is provided by the gelatin and yeah that is pretty damn good it makes you wonder if demi-glace and all kinds of classic meat dishes would have evolved quite differently if refined gelatin had always been readily available in the mirror universe where that happened me with a goatee is probably saying yeah i mean if you're in like some kind of crazy survival situation where you can't get powdered gelatin you could i guess take like a billion animal parts and put them in a pot and boil them for like a day but i mean that'd be crazy that'd be like boiling down 50 watermelons to get a cup of sugar to bake with long live the empire

***RECIPE, SERVES 6-8°°°...",29:02.6, a classic british shepherd's pie may be the greatest cold weather dish ever and if you cook it the whole way in a big cast iron instead of transferring it to a casserole or something it's a pretty efficient meal plus you get more brown crust per bite when you bake it in something wide and shallow a big 12 inch cast iron or any oven safe pan is fine and it's a shepherd's pie so we need some shepherd i mean sheep two pounds of ground lamb almost a kilo and i'm just putting it into a dry cold pan and smooshing it out into a wide thin disc i'll turn the heat on high under that and it'll render out enough fat to cook itself while it's getting started i'll prep my vegetables and while i'm loath to admit it i do like this thing i got from gordon ramsay where you grate the carrots and onion rather than chopping them you could chop them but grated they seem to form a structural mesh that helps bind the filling together in the pie that's one big onion and three or four carrots and over here i can smell that my mince is browning on the bottom brits call it mince even though it's ground not minced a stout wooden spoon is really the only tool for a job like this and as i stir the veg in and break everything up you can see the literal base of brown flavor i've already got and we can get more but first we've got to evaporate a ton of water out of this pan about five minutes after the veg went in i can feel things drying out so i'm going to reduce the heat to medium at this stage things could get out of control really fast and burn once i start seeing a carpet of brown stuff forming on the pan that i can't readily scrape up i know i've done about all i can do got to deglaze soon so in goes a huge squeeze of tomato paste maybe a quarter cup and a quarter cup of flour 30 grams if you want your filling to be really solid inside the pie you could use like twice that much flour i don't want it to be too gluey i'll stir and cook that for as long as i can until burning is imminent which is just going to be a couple of minutes in there we got to get that off the bottom you know i'm going to use white wine i think it's amazing how much it improves a dish like this it just makes it so much brighter and fresher in the end i'm putting in half a bottle and scraping until the bottom of this pan is clean a lot of people like red wine and this if you use it i recommend half as much or it'll get bitter and if you don't want to use alcohol water or stock is fine with a big slash of balsamic vinegar if you want that same sweetness and acidity you can add the vinegar to taste at the end now more flavorings i think you almost can't have enough worcestershire sauce like give me a whole bottle or at least half a cup 120 mls dried herbs i'm doing a ton of dried thyme and sage you're flavoring not only the mince but the potato topping too so i think it should be really strong garlic powder is phenomenal in something like this where it can really rehydrate and i like some mustard powder too if you got it no salt until we can taste for seasoning because the worcestershire sauce is so salty and then just enough water or stock to cover everything stir that all in and then i will simply reduce it to a simmer and let it cook down until thick i think the texture is really better if you give it an extra half hour at least to stew like this and dissolve some collagen or whatever and if you're a lucky duck like me and you've got a few ice cubes of chef john style homemade demi-glace in the freezer now is a great time to deploy them a big spoonful of store-bought stock concentrate or something would perform a similar function or a stock cube you just won't get the luscious texture the demi-glass provides and now it's time to consider the considerably less healthier layer of the pie potatoes i'm marginally able to get away with eating this because for breakfast i enjoy the sponsor of this video magic spoon cereal let me thank them ooh the new peanut butter flavor magic spoon is basically a child's breakfast cereal that won't totally wreck your adult body they have all the sweet flavors you love from childhood but

cinnamon too seasonal hit my link in the description for five dollars off with a 100 money back happiness guarantee i don't think you're gonna need that you'll love it magicspoon.com for five bucks off thank you magic spoon now back to the empty carbs i've got two pounds or almost a kilo of floury potatoes here russets i prefer their texture on a shepherd's pie but you do gotta peel them their skins have this horrible wet paper bag texture when boiled i'll just hack those into chunks for faster and more even cooking i like a relatively thin potato layer on my pie if you want something more like equal parts potato and meat filling you could almost double the potatoes here fill that up with water bring it to a boil and simmer until very fork tender not like that like that falling apart when you stab them drain them through a gap in the pot lid and you don't have to get a big colander dirty this is a two-pot dinner time for butter and you know they like a bit of shepherd's pie in ireland too i'm doing a whole darn stick of butter you could use less heat is off and i'll just let it melt in there in the residual heat while i finish up the meat you want to reduce this until it's quite thick or else it won't hold together at all in the pie time to taste and make final adjustments i'll grind in a huge amount of pepper and i think i want some more garlic powder and a big pinch of salt i love this kind of meal because there should be no surprises you can taste every element before it's done and if it needs some more sweetness or more acid or more salt or anything you can just stir it in and taste again you can't lose now fully off the hot burner this comes the cooler this is the more viscous it is and the more viscous it is the easier it will be to spread our potatoes on top they won't just sink speaking of which i'll put in a glug of milk and a pinch of salt to start with and start mashing might could put in some more milk it should look looser than you want it at this stage because we're going to put in more stuff that will cause it to thicken and set later cheese a lot of people put in parmesan feels wrong to me i'm just putting in some sharp english cheddar looks like i did maybe 50 grams there a couple ounces and then egg yolks these are what make the potato topping set into a puffy solid pie crust plus they taste great two should do it i'll get that all mixed in and then taste for seasoning needs more salt and there we are at the last possible second i'll chop up a little fresh rosemary from my plant and dump that in you don't have to have that also at the last second a whole 10 ounce bag of frozen peas that's 280 grams you do that at the last second and you're going to keep the peas from being disgustingly overcooked by the end plus if they're frozen they're going to cool this down which makes it more solid and therefore easier to top smooth everything off conversely the potato topping should be still hot when you put it on otherwise it won't flow as easily as you're trying to spread it around you can make things a lot easier by depositing it in drops all over the pie now you simply don't have to spread it as far to reach the edge i like kind of pulling it with the spatula scraping and pulling toward the edge it can be a little tricky to do this without mixing the filling up with the potato but if that happens it really doesn't matter much and you certainly don't have to make a seal or anything i just like how the topping goes brown and crispy on the pan edge the more irregular the potato top the more browned surface area you'll have hence the tradition of forking the top i'm just doing a spiral pattern for fun and in this will go to an already hot oven 400 fahrenheit 200c a convection fan is good and it's good that this pan is not quite filled to the brim because it's going to bubble and puff up here we are after a half hour and see it's done when it's bubbly and puffy if you're not happy with the browning you've got you could always turn on the top element the broiler at the very end i've got some chives i'm going to slice up and scatter over top i'll be honest and say i'm probably only doing that for the thumbnail and the trick is just letting this rest and cool for at least 20 minutes i'm scooping it here after 10 minutes and you can see how hot it still is and therefore how liquid it is still darn tasty though that potato topping is so puffy if you're more patient and let it cool a little bit longer you're going to get a more solid texture on that filling i love how it's slightly sweet against the salty potato the white wine helps with that so go out provision yourself for the winter and as the brits would say tuck in
Classic grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r4bGuZSur0E/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLCmzxpUiQxPx2gUpW8yGpU-J6eHGw,r4bGuZSur0E,"9 minutes, 4 seconds","Thanks to HelloFresh for sponsoring this video!

ever a classic grilled cheese sandwich that you can dip into some homemade tomato soup you'd want to get the soup on first but i have a feeling a lot of you are here for the sandwich so let's just start with that to me a classic grilled cheese just has three ingredients fluffy white factory made pre-sliced sandwich bread american cheese referred to abroad as processed cheese or cheese slices and a large quantity of softened butter that's it either butter at room temperature or you can throw cold butter into a microwave at low power just give it 10 or 20 seconds pull it out flip it around another quick hit and there we go not melted but easily slathered onto both slices of bread an obscene amount is called for when it hits the pan the outer layer of the butter will make the bread toast up all brown and crispy while the inner layer of the butter will just kind of melt into the interior of the bread where it won't brown it will stay sweet it's a magical combination any pan is fine but nonstick is foolproof it's on medium heat first slice goes in butter side down on goes two slices of cheddar and or colby cheese ground up and reconstituted with vegetable oil and emulsifying salts aka american cheese and my secret fourth ingredient which is just a little dusting of garlic powder i'm a fan of garlic powder and this is perhaps my favorite deployment of it second slice of bread goes on better side up and the crucial step cover it a lid is great if you have one but foil is fine it doesn't have to be an airtight seal just enough to retain some steam in there the steam is what will melt the cheese just be sure to check on it often those processed sandwich breads are full of sugar and can burn in a flash i do like mine just on the edge of burning before i flip quite dark and crispy don't worry if the cheese still isn't looking terribly melty cover it up the steam will melt it by the time side 2 is brown i often like to give it a few final flips uncovered just to get both sides hot and crispy look at that cheese nothing melts like processed cheese slices they make those for a reason unnaturally smooth gooey cheese now a lot of people maintain that mayonnaise not softened butter is the best thing to slather on your bread it's certainly more convenient you don't have to warm it up first if you like the mayo method i respect your choices but i am not a fan yes it seems to result in a crispier crust i'm not sure why it might be the lower water content compared to butter it might be the egg protein in it i don't know i just know that i think the flavor is very inferior to butter if you use low heat and grill it until just golden the mayo kind of tastes like nothing if you grill it until dark it develops this awful fishy flavor i couldn't tell you why here lauren has never had the mayo version let's give her a blind taste test grilled cheese should always be cut in triangles it's the law i like the triangles too but i think you should cut yours however you like it that's the butter version she's trying though she doesn't know it now here's the mayo version i don't know why it seems to have a seafood flavor am i just like conjuring up tuna salad again lots of people love the mayo trick if you're curious about it i say try it just maybe don't cook it as brown as you might with the butter version that's the version that gets me thinking about my mom making lunch on a snow day i would eat it with my puffy gloves and coat drying over the electric heater behind my chair at the kitchen table i will love that sandwich always but a slightly more sophisticated grilled cheese i like sometimes would use rye bread rye bread goes particularly well with tomato soup butter it up in it goes and i'll put on a slice of real sharp cheddar and a slice of swiss a little garlic powder again just gives it so much more depth and another piece on butter side up yeah you could just melt a ton of butter into the pan and then drop the dry sandwich into that the bread would absorb it but you'd probably end up wasting more butter and the butter would brown pretty heavily i like having that fresh sweet butter taste up inside the bread in addition to the brown crust if you're using real cheese and you want it to be gooey put a little water in the pan halfway through and seal with a tight lid it won't be gooey like the processed stuff but a good amount of steam will help the cheese pull more like that it makes it stretchy and grilled cheese is just as easy as that as easy as making dinner with the sponsor of this video hellofresh let's thank them before we make the soup lauren's been making all kinds of things since we signed up for america's number one meal kit delivery service it's really helped me build my confidence with

and code in the description thanks hellofresh now homemade tomato soup it's the easiest thing ever clank up an onion we're going to puree this later so precision cutting is moot here you don't have to do this but i like fennel bulb in tomato soup if you plan to strain the soup later you can chop up the stalks and put them in but if you're going to have it chunky style i recommend only using the bulb the stalks have little fibers in them that kind of get stuck in your throat if you don't strain them out i'm just shaving this kind of fine so it'll cook in the same time as the onion nice subtle licorice flavor there you could use oil but i like to use butter you could use a quarter this much better but i think a ton of butter really helps tomato soup taste like a soup and not just a bowl of tomato sauce in goes the onion and fennel on medium heat i just want to give these a head start without browning anything i'll grind in some pepper and highly optional some celery seeds i love that flavor with the tomatoes and fennel and if you get the seeds in early they'll soften by the time you eat last thing maybe a quarter cup of flour 30 grams stir that into the butter to make a roux that'll give the soup a nice velvety texture again we're going to puree it so don't worry about lumps before anything browns in goes the tomatoes and their juice one of the advantages of making your own tomato soup instead of eating the canned stuff is you can use better tomatoes garden tomatoes in the summer or really high quality canned ones in the winter these ones from california are really top-notch hashtag not an ad i've got two 28-ounce cans in there and if you've got whole tomatoes you could just let them cook and break apart naturally but you can't accelerate things with a potato masher this will just help them cook quicker and you could use more tomatoes but again my goal is to make it taste like tomato soup instead of tomato sauce and i find it helps on that score to keep the proportion of non-tomato ingredients relatively high a lot of people put in a bunch of chicken or veggie stock now you could do that i tend to prefer plain water in vegetable soups but you know it's been a while like a glass of white wine this will certainly need more moisture before we're done but you can always add you can't subtract so i generally start soups on the dry side and then add water at the end to taste i'll turn the heat down just to let that simmer for maybe an hour tops scrape the bottom every now and then so nothing sticks and burns meanwhile for garnish i'm gonna grab a little pot and make some quick chili oil you can buy it but it's easy to make i'll just dump in some dried chili flakes into a little olive oil you could use way more than that if you want it super spicy and i'll put in a crushed garlic clove the garlic tastes good and the water in it serves as a thermometer if it's just barely sizzling that means that you've got enough heat to infuse the oil without creating any burned flavors i'll just let that infuse on low heat while the soup cooks you'll see why here we are like 40 minutes later and it's time to puree this i love immersion blenders so much so much less work than getting out a food processor transferring the soup over and then cleaning it after plus this gives you more control you don't have to blitz this totally smooth if you don't want to i'll just run that under the faucet and put it away time to give this a taste it needs a ton of salt and some water too thick for me and i do wish it was a little more tomatoey so i'll squeeze in some tomato paste a lot of people add some sugar at this stage if the tomatoes aren't naturally sweet enough these are now i really like that kind of crude texture however if you want to you can strain this sieve over a bowl and then just put in only as much as you can work with at a time you just take a stiff spoon and grind the soup into the sieve it takes a minute a food mill would perform this function a little more efficiently but a sieve and a spoon works too and pretty soon you'll just have a ball of plant fibers in the sieve underneath you'll have the super smooth texture that you might be familiar with from the canned tomato soups i like both textures what i don't like about any pureed soup is it's homogeneity it's like baby food every bite is exactly the same that's what the chili oil fixes you spoon that on and it just floats at the top and creates some nice variety as you eat you can dose it onto each spoonful however you like plus you can also pick some of the fronds off of that fennel chop them up and scatter those on too very nice and then you can just dip the corner of that sandwich in there that's why i like the triangle shape an unbeatable cold weather combination that recipe makes a lot of soup just freeze the rest and save it for a snowy day now excuse me i have a date with that bit of crispy cheese there
Easier pan pizza in a non-stick — browned base and crispy rim,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9TjUWnAK0cg/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLCTBHm3YSkgo8Iig2yk9qBDDdfbZQ,9TjUWnAK0cg,"9 minutes, 43 seconds","Thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this video! Go to Squarespace.com for a free trial, and when you’re ready to launch, go to http://squarespace.com/ragusea and add code “RAGUSEA"" at...",29:02.6, this video is sponsored by squarespace here's a much easier much more reliable method for making a great pan pizza a pizza style pioneered in the american midwest and yes popularized by a global chain that rhymes with it's a glut they don't need my publicity you can absolutely use any pizza dough with this method but here's what i've been using for pan pizzas lately bread flour but all-purpose would be fine a cup to start with like 120 grams i actually put in a little too much you'll see half a teaspoon of salt maybe three grams two or three grams of sugar half a teaspoon and half a teaspoon of dry yeast a gram or two a little glug of olive oil maybe a couple of teaspoons and you don't have to do this but garlic powder inside the dough works great with a thick crust pizza in a thin crust too much of it would burn just a dash i'm only making one portion of dough here and instead of water i'm using milk pizza butt uses various powdered milk products in their crusts it makes for some very nice caramelly notes in the brown surface half a cup of milk some people say you got a scald milk before you use it in a yeast bread heating it to almost boiling deactivates enzymes or proteins in the milk that can interfere with the gluten and the rise i tried this dough with scalded milk and with milk straight from the fridge and i noticed absolutely no difference maybe because my milk is pasteurized i don't know i do know that i put in too much flour so more milk to balance it i think wet sticky doughs are better for pan pizza they bake up fluffier and when i'm kneading a tiny little ball of dough for just one pizza i kind of like to do it up in the air between my hands this is super easy you just kind of squish it and grind it between your palms it's oddly satisfying and it doesn't get the counter dirty let's see is it smooth and elastic enough that i can form a thin sheet without it tearing check form it into a smooth ball yeah i wish it was a little bit stickier but it's fine back into the bowl cover it up and let it rise for an hour or two this took two because my kitchen is super cold right now doubled in size you could absolutely do my normal thing where i put the dough straight in the fridge and let it ferment slowly for a few days that's good too but either way we're going to do a second rise in the pan i used to use cast iron for pan pizza but i have switched to my non-stick a 10 inch teflon pan with an oven safe handle you could use cast iron but i have found this makes it so much easier you'll see why just a little bit of olive oil in the pan too much and the pizza has a really fried taste to it just a dab and i do like to put some seasonings in this oil a little pinch of dried oregano basil chili flakes whatever you like and a tiny pinch of salt a little salt goes a long way here and then you just completely coat the pan this results in a distinct layer of flavor on the bottom of the pizza that is quite tasty heterogeneity and while my hands are still greasy i'll grab my dough ball and plop it in i used to stretch the dough first and then lay it in the pan i found it's easier to just mash it straight into the pan with my fingertips this also helps me to get a more even thickness throughout if you do traditional stretching up in the air the thick outer ring of dough you get tends to make all the sauce and cheese pool into the center with this style of pizza i'm stretching it up past the corner of the pan not because i want it up there but because i know this dough is going to contract before all is said and done so start wider than you want it i'll rub a thin layer of oil on top because it tastes good and because it'll keep this from drying out as it gets a second rise in the pan at least for a half an hour that really helps it bake up lighter and fluffier it tends to be kind of dense and doughy if you skip this second rise and while it's rising we can prep everything else for sauce i'm still on this particular make and model of canned tomatoes it's the best thing for pizza sauce i can find in u.s grocery stores when i can't find it i use another brand of crushed or ground tomatoes and i spike it with a little tomato paste for extra flavor i don't normally measure it but a third of a cup is perfect for a pan pizza this size imho here's my new favorite pizza herb marjoram smells like tea but tastes like oregano crossed with time maybe i'll also use some oregano and basil and a tiny pinch of sugar a little chili flakes black pepper and a dab of olive oil stir it all up and that's it if it looks like not quite enough sauce to me then it's probably exactly enough let's prep our cheese for new york style pizza i scour the earth for whole milk low moisture mozzarella but on my pan pizzas i've really been liking the part skim kind lately and this stuff is way easier to find it's got to be low moisture though that's an eight ounce block i'll use five or six ounces like 150 grams i miss the full fat flavor but the part skim kind just seems to brown better with this particular recipe and for that same reason i think it's particularly important to avoid pre-grated cheese for this the anti-clumping starch they put on the pre-grated stuff is particularly likely to burn with this method i'm gonna show you there we go and lastly i do like to put some grated parmesan over the sauce layer i suppose now's as good a time as any to admit that i prefer the pre-grated stuff for pizza i have real parmigiano-reggiano in the fridge right now i could use it but it just doesn't taste right on pizza to me the fake stuff tastes right to me last thing to prep is my topping whatever toppings you want are fine but this is my new favorite pizza topping a tiny clove of fresh garlic tiny because we're going to eat it raw and raw garlic is super strong just a couple little shavings of lemon zest the bright yellow part with as little of the underlying white pith as possible and then a little bunch of fresh parsley chop it all up and you've got gremolata the traditional last minute garnish for lots of italian dishes chopping those three ingredients into each other really does seem to spark a chemical reaction between them the result tastes like more than the sum of its parts a last minute sprinkling of that makes all kinds of things taste fresher and i don't know more sophisticated okay the dough has visibly puffed up a bit so we're ready to bake you can simply top your dough and then throw the whole pan into a screaming hot oven that's traditional but what i do is a lot more energy efficient it's easier to control and it gets you a much browner bottom heat on medium and at the same time i'll get my oven's broiler heating to max that's the element at the top of the oven it heats up in a flash and i've got a rack positioned pretty close to it after a minute i can see the dough puffing up and after four minutes i can smell it starting to brown with my old method i would start topping the pizza now but the way i cook it these days is to completely finish browning the bottom before anything else goes in you do it this way and you can use a soft spatula to lift up the dough and see exactly what's going on with the non-stick pan you can just kind of shake it like an omelette to make sure it's not stuck and you can move it or rotate it around if some parts seem to be browning more than others with my old method you'd have to guess when the bottom is perfect with this method there's no guessing you just cook it until you like the bottom i like it just starting to burn a little burning is part of what makes bread taste like pizza to me and there we are so off the heat this comes now there's no particular rush i'll just smooth my sauce around edge to edge no bare ring of crust around the edge the stuff on the sides of the pan will caramelize and go super sweet dust on a little parmesan or whatever you want to call this substance it really enhances the flavor and hiding it under the mozzarella layer keeps it from burning again edge to edge with the mutts those bits of cheese touching the sides of the pan are going to do magical things that's it and under the grill this goes brits call it a grill i find this pizza cooks much better and faster if i keep my oven door closed yes people say you should not put teflon under the broiler it could overheat and put off toxic fumes good advice but this is only going to be under there for literally two minutes i've done tests with my infrared thermometer the exposed teflon never got remotely close to the temperature at which ptfe starts to break down causing polymer fume fever in very high doses it never got close if you can't risk it or if you have a pet bird around use cast iron birds are super sensitive to polymer fumes but i'm super sensitive to pizza fumes and this smells awesome you just pull it when it's brown to your liking look at that crispy cheese on the edge and because i use the non-stick pan it's going to come right off i'll sprinkle on my gremolata you want to let this cool in the pan for just a few minutes just until it's solidified enough that you can get it out intact the sooner you get it out to a cooling rack the crispier the bottom will be and look with a non-stick you can literally just slide the pizza out like an omelet couldn't be easier now that it's on the rack where steam can escape you're safe to let this cool as long as you want before eating i like to let it cool way down hey look up there you can see that super dark and even brown bottom but it's got nothing i ain't seen before though there's no surprises here i always hated my old method where you just had to guess when the bottom was perfect though say it's not perfect maybe you didn't get out of the pan fast enough and now it's soggy you can very easily just re-fry this for a few minutes basically until you hear it start to sizzle again that'll bring the crust right back to life i've said in the past that i don't think pizza cutters are good for the home kitchen i prefer using a knife because a pizza cutter just tends to fall right off the edges of your little cutting board but with a pizza this small in diameter it's fine cut yours however you want i like small slices because they are so thick and so rich the milk has made that crust a little bit cakey in an awesome way that is just such a great guilty pleasure

***RECIPE, MAKES 4 DOZEN COOKIES***...",29:02.6, here's a basic all you need to know primer on making christmas sugar cookies the kind you roll out cut into shapes and decorate with a thin icing that's really a glaze it sets up hard i love this tradition i'm pretty sure i've done this every year that i've been alive there's tons of great roll out sugar cookie recipes they nearly all work but the one i'm using is from my wife's grandmother grandma sherstrom see make every year she's left us no alternative i've only slightly tweaked her recipe the big thing i did is cut it in half be careful lots of heirloom holiday baking recipes were written in the days when people were more likely to have huge families i cut this in half and it still makes four dozen cookies pretty much any sugar cookie dough will start with a softened butter if your butter is cold you can soften it in the microwave i've got a stick and a half that's six ounces 170 grams drop the power to low then just nuke it for 10 or 15 seconds at a time reach in and rotate another 10 seconds or so reach in and rotate if you didn't stop and rotate part of the butter might melt while the other side is still cold there we are soft but not melted into a big mixing bowl gotta have soft butter to beat in sugar a cup and a half of granulated sugar 300 grams a cheap electric hand mixer makes baking so much easier and i think i prefer them to expensive stand mixers for most things because they give you more control you can move around and get in the corner i see a lot of people on the internet complaining that their sugar cookies come out too fluffy and cakey you might be creaming too much air into the butter at this stage i really just bring them together before beating in two eggs until smooth grandma surestrom actually beats the eggs into the butter before she puts in the sugar i think that's another way to keep the batter from getting too fluffy for rollout cookies i put in a lot of vanilla at least a tablespoon some people prefer to put it in the icing but that darkens the color makes the icing less white if you don't put in vanilla or almond extract or something into the batter you should probably put in a tablespoon of milk or water just to get enough moisture i love enough salt in the cookies to be noticeably salty it's a great contrast against the sugar icing i'm doing half a teaspoon of morton kosher like three grams i've got salted butter in there already if it was unsalted butter i'd put twice as much salt in baking powder two teaspoons eight grams people say you gotta mix this and the salt into the flour first you absolutely do not have to do that not for cookies makes no difference the all-purpose flour you wanna mix in a little at a time i'm starting with a cup gonna do about three cups total maybe 360 grams if you tried to mix it in all at once it would just explode everywhere three batches is good in my opinion the cookies are best when the batter is very dry lots of flour in there that's still quite sticky in this kind of cookie a really sticky batter tends to make a very thin crispy cookie i want one that's a little taller and more crumbly plus the edges come out cleaner with a drier dough they spread more if the dough is soft i also want a cookie that's a little under sweet so that it works in harmony with the glaze which is solid sugar all this adds up to put in a lot of flour i'm just mixing in flour until it's hardly sticky at all you don't want to go too far though because if the batter is super dry it'll crack a lot as you try to roll it out that feels perfect right there just barely sticky now the essential step the batter has to be cold when you roll it i'll chill it in the fridge for at least an hour during which time i can sit by the tree and enjoy a cup from the sponsor of this video trade coffee trade is a way to discover amazing new coffees from the best roasters you go online and take a quiz where you tell them what

when you sign up with my link in the description free shipping too hit my link in the description thank you trade now let's get ready to roll cookie cutters i recommend simple shapes complex ones like this darn snowflake are much harder to punch out they're more delicate and their edges tend to get overcooked you'll see simple shapes are better i switched from metal to plastic a few years ago and never looked back the metal ones always rust on me probably in part because i only use them once a year the rest of the time they sit in a humid cabinet baking sheets you'll want as many as you can fit in your oven at a time you don't have to use parchment paper but i highly recommend it it makes sticking impossible and cleanup easier and i recommend getting the kind that come pre-cut into single sheets like this super convenient compared to the one big roll that you have to cut with scissors rolling pin a wine bottle works if you don't have one i recommend having a spatula handy to scrape the unbaked cookies off your rolling surface if they stick and to keep them from sticking you'll need some kind of edible powder i'm using powdered sugar you could just use flour i honestly don't think it makes a big difference either way and i absolutely think this is one of those times to just work directly on the countertop you need a lot of space and if you have a stone counter that's perfect stone helps keep the batter from warming up too fast and i recommend working with the dough straight out of the fridge it might feel too cold to roll too brittle but just be patient roll it a little turn it roll it a little turn it have faith it will start to spread just be gentle turning helps you get it to spread evenly in all directions and it keeps the bottom from sticking to the counter as you turn you release it and you sweep fresh powder around the underside it doesn't matter at all if the edges crack up because we're punching out little shapes we're not using the whole sheet as is i'm shooting for two or three millimeters thick it doesn't have to be precise i like to have some thinner cookies that are a little crispier and some thicker ones that are a little chewier it's all good the secret to punching them out push straight down hard then keep pushing as you twist a little bit the twisting pulls the cookie away from the scrap and releases its bottom from the countertop whoops there you go if possible the easier thing to do is to use the cutter to simply lift the cookie over to the pan they won't spread very much when they bake so you can position them pretty close you do want to punch out with maximum geometric efficiency to minimize waste you can gather up the trimmings and roll it out again but the cookies from the second rolling will never be as tender as those from the first i try to select shapes that'll fit nicely within the natural contours of the rolled dough lauren is gonna do a few and there she didn't twist the cutter with that snowflake so it's stuck to the counter the spatula works great though and you'll need it more and more as the dough warms up and therefore gets softer and stickier everything is easier if you work fast but best laid plans go out the window once tiny hands get involved that's fine this is christmas cookies it's not a special forces operation like i said you can put them pretty close on the pan they'll only spread a millimeter or so okay so here's all my trimmings i can gather those up but if i tried to roll out and punch some more cookies now look what happens the dough is too warm too soft and sticky just throw it in the freezer for five or ten minutes and then you can start again these cookies really will be fine their texture will just be a little harder than the first ones okay time to bake a convection bake setting was made for a job like this that fan will circulate the air and make sure that all the pans bake reasonably evenly i'm doing 350 fahrenheit 180c convection if you don't have a fan i'd do 375 fahrenheit and you'll need to rotate the pans halfway through so they cook evenly though look even with the fan after about 18 minutes i can see the bottom tray is done prematurely it's hotter down there apparently out it comes and that snowflake got overdone complex shapes have more edge relative to their total mass which means the edges are likely to get too hot not a fan i basically look for the very first signs of browning when i see the edges just starting to turn the cookies are done out they come that kind of crackly surface on them is from the powdered sugar by the way if you don't like it roll with flour but it's all going to get covered in icing after we let these cooled all the way down you got to let them cool to do really fancy decorating you'd probably want a royal icing made with egg whites i just do the simplest thing which is a giant mountain of powdered sugar and just enough milk to dissolve it into a glaze water would be fine you'll be shocked at how little moisture it takes just a glug of milk and you can always add more sugar or more milk if it's too thick or too thin if you want a super shiny look on the dried cookie you can put in a big squeeze of corn syrup but that also softens the texture a bit i prefer the glazed crispy when dried that's perfect right there half of that goes into a big bowl and the other half i'll divide into little bowls so that i can make different colors be careful about putting in too much food coloring that's actually enough added moisture to make this too loose i needed to mix in more powdered sugar plus the color will darken as the cookie dries i totally put in too much blue i'll make this one green still needs a little more sugar glazes are very sensitive to moisture don't expect any advanced decorating tips here i will only say that it's easier if you could just dip the cookie into your base coat of icing that gets you nice clean edges that way and you can drizzle over another color and have a ton of fun with a toothpick you can certainly just paint on the icing with a butter knife if you'd rather do that and if you're going to use sprinkles you can control their flow much better if you just tap the bottle tap tap tap that's as fancy as i get because honestly once the aforementioned tiny hands get involved this descends into pure chaos as nature intended oh you can't eat it you gotta decorate it first can i just lick this off [Music] if you set these aside the icing will harden by morning and the cookie will soften a little bit as it sucks in moisture from the air this is far and away my favorite part of christmas if i can do this with my grandkids one day i will consider my life a win even though the aftermath is always a staggering mess but you can eat the remnants as you clean and you know what goes great with cookies remember to get 30 off your first bag of coffee from trade with my link in the description and have a merry christmas if that's your

Exclusive Holiday Discount/Free U.S....",29:02.6, chocolate coconut tart this is a really easy yet fancy dessert recipe i came up with while experimenting with coconut fats coconut oil makes beautifully crumbly pastry crusts and coconut cream makes an exceptionally smooth chocolate ganache with a cooling mouth feel and totally incidentally this recipe is vegan that's just a bonus as far as i'm concerned i wasn't trying to make it vegan first thing is make the crust it's something between a short crust pastry and a crumbly cracker crust like a cup of all-purpose flour 120 grams but this is not a fussy pastry it does not have to be precise half a cup of sugar 100 grams and then like 50 grams or half a cup of almond flour for some extra flavor and crumbly texture though you could use an equivalent amount of coconut shreds for example if you want to double down on the coconut thing you could replace this with just more ap flour or if you have celiac you could use solid almond flour for this now you could use cold butter but i'm using coconut oil virgin coconut oil like this gets you a nice subtle coconut flavor refined coconut oil will have almost no flavor at all and it should be solid like this at room temperature if it's not solid your kitchen is probably too warm chill the oil in the fridge before you cut it into the dough it needs to be solid i've got half a cup of coconut fat in there that's eight tablespoons about 110 grams last thing is salt i like to have a nice salty crust on a chocolate tart half a teaspoon of morton kosher is what i'm using that's two or three grams you could use more and you could throw all that into the food processor and just pulse it until it's like a coarse breadcrumb consistency or you could do it the old-fashioned way with a pastry cutter or a fork you just cut the tines of the fork into the big chunks of solid fat as you cut those chunks into smaller chunks they immediately get covered in flour and such which disperses the fat bits it keeps them from sticking together again it'll feel like you're doing absolutely nothing but keep at it and all of a sudden you'll have that coarse breadcrumb consistency if you can squeeze it and it just barely holds a solid shape that is done that is what gives you a crumbly or short pastry if you want something a little more flaky you can pick up handfuls of this and do that with them to squeeze out long sheets of fat coated in flour aka flakes but this will still be pretty crumbly because we're not actually going to roll this out and because there's no water in this dough coconut oil is nearly 100 fat unlike butter which is like 15 water that water reacts with gluten to make a more elastic dough there's no water at all in this so this pastry is going to be super brittle which is what i'm after it's like a graham cracker crust and you can simply mold this into a normal pie or cake pan it'll be delicious but you would not be able to cut out nice pretty slices for that you need a tart pan with a removable bottom these things are cheap and you can just lift the tart up out of the pan when it's done my recipe is calibrated for this pretty standard nine inch diameter size 23 centimeters or it could work with four of these mini guys that i'm going to use four and a half inches wide with these little ones each person gets their own tarts and there's more edge crust relative to the total volume which means fewer bites will be exactly the same heterogeneity i'm just pushing the crumbs into the molds my recipe gives you a very thick crust layer it's equal parts crust and ganache because that's what i'm into you can make less crust if you wanted try to push it into the corners and make sure it's not too thick down there in the corner it's going to melt a bit in the oven and slump down into the corner so if it's too thin in the corners when it goes in the oven it'll be just right on the way out you could use a measuring cup or a glass or something to really stamp these out smooth but i don't think that makes a really noticeable difference in the end and there's the four tartlets how was that not the name of a motown group we'll bake them empty at 350 fahrenheit 180c baking them on a tray will make it easier to get them out when they're hot and the tray will catch any melting pastry that would otherwise fall and burn now there's nothing really to do but clean up might as well listen to some tunes by this remarkable undiscovered talent on soundcloud i mean wow and he sounds great via the sponsor of this video cove audio whom i'll now briefly thank this is the cove commuter 2 just the best darn bluetooth speaker you can imagine it syncs with your phone or computer or whatever in a flash the controls are really simple and obvious and i wonder how this visionary soundcloud composer would sound in true wide stereo [Music] that's how amazing there's a 30 foot range between these two halves you can charge them simultaneously up to seven hours of playtime on a charge it's water resistant which is great for kitchen use there's a built-in microphone and it gets darn loud apart or reunited if you follow my link in the description you can save more than 67 on the commuter too making it far more affordable than any comparable speaker i've seen and remember it's basically a two-for-one deal because it has two speakers link is in the description for 67 off thank you cove after 15 or 20 minutes the pastry shells should be kind of molten and bubbly this is not the kind of pastry that will stick all the way up the sides of the tart pan so don't expect it to you could pull these right now or you could bake them a little longer until they brown a bit the browning tastes delicious but it can also drown out the subtle flavor of the coconut and it can make the pastry harder to cut with a fork pick your poison i will say if you want a stronger coconut flavor you could add a few drops of coconut flavoring to the dough or the ganache i tried that i liked it but lauren thought it tasted like sunscreen anyway you got to let these cool all the way down before you fill them wait until they're ready then make the ganache filling you could use a product labeled coconut milk or coconut cream i'm using the cream it's the same stuff as the milk except it will have more of this luscious fat floating in the can above the layer of coconut water at the bottom and i'm just lifting the semi-solid cream out of the can and dropping it into a microwave-safe measuring jug i'm looking for one cups worth 240 mils if you don't have enough of the cream to get you that much you can top it off with the coconut water you've left behind that's fine the more coconut water you have in there the more soft the ganache will be which is not an inherently good or bad thing now for the chocolate it's the star of the show so use a chocolate you really like either chips or chop up a bar into chunks ganache is generally equal parts cream traditionally dairy cream of course and chocolate you can easily measure that volume of the chocolate by displacement just mix in enough that you've got two total cups of stuff in there almost 500 mils but it does not have to be precise easiest way to make ganache is to just throw it in a microwave on like half power for a minute or two just long enough until you can melt it together i usually wait until i see the first signs of melting chocolate and then i take it out and stir it should look like it's not quite hot enough yet because if you keep stirring it and spreading around the heat it will go smooth at a surprisingly low temperature this is good because if you get it too hot it can kind of seize up and go grainy taste it you could call that done or you could put in a little dab of vanilla or almond extract or any flavoring you like you might also want it sweeter depending on your tastes and how dark your chocolate was to begin with you can stir in a little granulated sugar but it's safer to squeeze in a little syrup any syrup granulated sugar could give you a gritty texture don't make it too sweet because the crust is plenty sweet i think the filling should taste a little too intensely chocolatey in isolation this last step will be a lot easier if you do it directly in the fridge you just fill the tarts all the way to the brim it doesn't matter if you go higher than your walls of crust filling these in the fridge saves you from having to transfer them in while they're full and soft and sloshing around you would spill a lot look how pretty that is and then just chill these until they're solid a couple hours at least but they'll be firmer if you chill them overnight like i did there they are the next day now these are too cold for you to push the tart up out of its ring right now the crust and ganache is still stuck to the sides get yourself a wide flat vessel and pour in a thin layer of hot tap water stick the tart in there and within seconds that will melt the stuff clinging to the ring and you can easily lift the tart out get a knife in there to lever off the bottom piece or don't bother just serve it right on the base that water trick works great if you just left these on the counter until soft the whole tart would be too warm by the time you could de-pan it you could put some raspberries or something on there for fancy or not i prefer a light sprinkling of smoked sea salt crazy good you can also tap on a little bit of powdered sugar that's pretty but do it right before you eat because that thing is cold so there's going to be condensation forming on it which will dissolve the sugar and that looks kind of ugly i prefer the smoked sea salt now especially if you browned the crust it's gonna be a little tough to push your fork through because it's so cold and thick you might instead consider putting it on a cutting board and cutting it into little wedges like a wheel of brie just wipe the knife clean in between each cut this turns it into a finger food which makes it a nice thing for people standing around at a party or something that's just so tasty and again i feel like that coconut milk ganache has a cooling mouth feel as though it's working on my thermoreceptors the same way that something like mint does am i just making that up well you try this recipe and you tell me

Jeollanamdo is a province of South Korea, also known as Jeonnam. Learn more about...",29:02.6, this video is sponsored by the government of jola namdoe or south jola province in korea we're going to use some of the beautiful local ingredients of this seaside province to make a traditional dish of dried fish and chili sauce then i'm going to get creative and try to invent my own dish using these same ingredients all of which are available from the jolo namdo store on amazon i have discount codes in the description that you can use and you can get one of these goodies here for free if you enter the giveaway that i'll explain at the end this province is known as jonam for short i'm going to use that name from here on out jonom is where three major rivers empty to the sea there are vast river basins where tons of wonderful stuff is farmed and then of course there's the ocean they love their seafood there especially this guy he is called a yellow croaker also known as yellow corvina but the korean name is golby and he has been salted and dried in the wind making him a bori galbi or barley galbi once preserved you would traditionally store this guy by burying him in a clay jar filled with barley this is apparently one of the really iconic foods in this part of korea and i'm snipping off all of his fins just to get them out of the way and to be extra sure that none of them are going to end up in my final dish the fins are extremely pokey give him a quick wash and then i'll dry him thoroughly because i'm going to fry them on the stove the fish is already steamed it's cooked we just want to warm it up which you can do in the microwave but microwaving a preserved fish tends to be very stinky plus we can get some beautiful color on the skin if we just cook this in a little oil on a non-stick surface medium heat on my stove and this will take five or six minutes again just warming it through and getting some nice crispy skin yes i'm doing two because i'm doing two dishes remember but the first one is the traditional one we're gonna coat the fish in a chili sauce based on this gochujang korean red chili paste a couple tablespoons of that in a big mixing bowl maybe half a tablespoon of this chili powder it's not super hot i minced up one garlic clove and i'll put that in it's gonna be raw so be careful how much you put in this is traditional korean dark soy sauce aged at least five years very intense only half a tablespoon of that this is an extract of korean green plums called mayshield traditionally regarded as having medicinal properties it's just a great sour syrup starting with a tablespoon although i might add more later here's this beautiful gift box of toasted oils the dark one is sesame oil really intense nutty flavor just a teaspoon of that and i'll mix it all up i want a slightly looser texture than that i think so i'm going to put in more of that green plum syrup the sweetness will also balance the heat and the saltiness of the fish which has now cooled down to the point where i can handle it and debone it take off the head to start with first thing i'm doing is using my scissors to gently pull out this line of bone along the dorsal side of the fish when deboning cooked fish i always think about sliding out the bone or sliding meat off the bone once that top bone is off it's really easy to open up the fish and there's its spinal column there just sliding out of the meat and bringing its ribs with it you're still going to see some little pin bones in there but that's okay because the next thing we're going to do is just pull apart all the meat into little bite size shreds and in the process we can run our fingers through everything and any remaining bones will present themselves oh and there's some really nice bites of meat up in the head got to get those out then all we do is toss that meat into our chili sauce gently i don't want to break my chunks up into tiny shreds here's some rice that i steamed doing the bowl trick to be fancy and i'll ceremonially reunite the head with its body there look at that vivid red color in the sauce there totally natural color and for garnish a big stack of gim korean crispy roasted seaweed you can just eat them they're toasty and delicious or you can make little rolls of fish and rice in them oh and it'd be quite traditional to garnish that fish with some sesame seeds also on the side there i've got some roasted or scorched brown rice snacks called nuruji crispy and delicious you can also fry them and top them with sugar for dessert and i've got some table salt here from sunchun bay the green stuff in it is a plant called hamcho in korean also called salakorina or glasswart it grows in salt marshes though you probably won't need any salt with this fish it's a salted fish after all which is why i was careful to steam my rice in the common east asian way where it is unseasoned there's no salt in that rice so the rice and the fish really complement each other delicious taste of the southwestern korean coast right there okay so now i'm going to do a fusion thing and try to use these ingredients in something closer to my own culinary language i'm going to make a salad dressing with one of these oils that's perilla oil another delicious toasted seed oil from jonam a dab of that long aged soy sauce and some of the plum syrup for sweetness like i'd normally use honey in salad dressing and just rice vinegar for acidity mix that up and have a taste needs more vinegar and there's my dressing for a little salad that will accompany my bori galbi frittata for eggs you could do more but i want a very thin delicate omelette because the flavors will be very strong no need to season the eggs because the fish is salty i've chopped up a couple of spring onions and an assortment of chilies which i will give a couple minute head start frying in my non-stick omelette pan medium heat give the onions a minute to fry as well before i stir in the meat that i picked off my other dried croaker and then i'll stir in my beaten egg it's crucial to stir fast to get everything integrated before the egg sets up i'll spread that out to get a solid layer of egg across the bottom you could just flip this and finish it on the stove but to me a frittata or italian style omelette goes in the oven specifically under a very hot broiler or grill just for a minute until the top is a little bit brown and this is just arugula or rocket as the brits would say it's got a peppery taste that goes really well with east asian flavors and i'll dress it lightly you're going to slide that frittata out onto a plate and cut off a wedge a little salad on the side and i'll top that with a dusting of that hamcho salt thanks to the jola namdo trade office for sponsoring this video and for sharing your beautiful

...",29:02.6, stuffed shells it's one of those classics that led me as a child to believe that all italian-american entrees were just different configurations of pasta red sauce and ricotta cheese i haven't had it in years and i'm so excited step one is get a giant pot of sauce going you could get away with half the quantity i'm making right now but it's always good to make extra and freeze it i'm just chopping up two big onions doesn't matter what kind and then i'll peel and chop at least half a head of garlic nice big pot over medium-high heat tons of olive oil on the bottom and in goes the onions i'll just stir those pretty frequently until they soften and start to go brown maybe 10 minutes in between stirs i can start opening three or four 28 ounce cans of crushed tomatoes each of those is about 800 grams when you need them you're gonna need them fast so get at least one open in advance onions are browning and this is one i usually put in my garlic you could put it in from the start but it'll burn if you don't stir constantly then i'll put in one of these little six ounce cans of tomato paste 170 grams and let it fry for a sec i knew i should have been using a wooden spoon the spatula just is not rigid enough to bash that stuff around and right when you're terrified that tomato paste is going to burn like that ah in goes the can of tomatoes that you were careful to open in advance scrape the bottom of the pan to deglaze and i'll put in two or three more of these big cans and you certainly don't have to do this but it's nice to put in a glass of wine red or white grind in a bunch of pepper and whatever dried herbs you want i've got oregano thyme and dried basil big pinch of salt to start with and i think i'll pour in more olive oil i like lots of oil in my sauce stir that up and then you can just simmer this over medium-low heat while you do everything else just stir it frequently like in between every other task you do you let it sit for too long the stuff on the bottom will burn next we do the cheese filling i've got a pound and a half of ricotta cheese here 680 grams that is i do think full fat ricotta tastes better but part skim is all they had at the store it's fine we can make it smoother and meltier with a pound of mozzarella 450 grams and i'm using fresh motts but any kind is fine and to give it some stronger flavor i've got 7 ounces or 200 grams of pecorino romano this is the hard grating cheese that i grew up with as opposed to parmesan these big sloppy red sauce italian-american dishes were generally originated by immigrants from southern italy like the ragusas and pecorino is popular in the south pecorino is basically parmesan but made with sheep's milk instead of cow's milk and then when you get down to the tiny square that you can't grate anymore you could eat it or throw it in your sauce it needs a stir anyway it always needs a stir take your mozzarella and grate it up as fine as you can some people set some of that mozzarella aside to melt over the top at the end i don't like to do that i will grab some of that pecorino and save it for dusting at the table before i get rid of my grater i'm going to grate a couple more cloves of garlic you could chop them but i think for the cheese filling i want the garlic as fine as possible and you don't need much because it isn't going to get cooked very much all this goes into a nice big mixing bowl and you may think this seems like a lot of cheese but this will make the right amount of filling for a one pound bag of shells you'll see in goes my pound and a half of ricotta ricotta being a cottage cheese type product that is recooked from the whey leftover from other cheese making it's relatively lean high protein which makes it work as the primary bulk of this whole dish speaking of protein in goes some eggs i'm doing four which is maybe kind of a lot you don't have to use any but it makes the filling set into something more cakey without the egg the filling is more crumbly tends to fall off your fork when you're trying to eat a huge amount of black pepper but no salt the pecorino is salty enough in there last thing is to chop up some fresh herbs this is parsley i'm just pulling it off the stems bits of thin stem are fine but thick ones i try to leave behind same deal with this bunch of basil and then i'll just mow through that a lot of people put blanched spinach in the filling you could do that frozen spinach works great for that just drain it thoroughly before you put it in again i'll grab some of this and reserve it for garnishing at the table the rest goes in the filling and now you just get in there and smash it all up get a nice homogeneous mixture it feels almost like a dough by the time you're done with it and there you can see that i've got a big pot of water coming to a boil for my shells while i wait i can scan my grocery receipt with the sponsor of this video fetch rewards whom i'll now briefly thank

download the app now use ragusia to get 4000 points with your first receipt thank you fetch now salt that water jumbo shells really big ones smaller ones are just impossible to fill these are from italy so it's a 500 gram package which is a little over one pound and it says they're cooked for 15 minutes well then i'm going to boil them for maybe 12 minutes yes it'd be nice if i had a bigger pot but i'm using my big one for the sauce it'll be fine as long as i stir these to make sure they don't stick to the bottom you want to boil these until they're pliable and you can fill them but they should still be a little crunchy because they're going to cook more in the oven three minutes less than the package directions usually works great drain them into a colander and then i would rinse them with cold water to stop their cooking to rinse off the starch that would cause them to stick together and also to cool them down so you can handle them my sauce is looking nice and it's time to finish it up give it a taste if your instinct is to stir in a little sugar try stirring in some more salt first salt really offsets the bitter notes in canned tomatoes though there's no shame in putting in a pinch of sugar too that's clemenza's trick how's poly and these tomatoes i had were pretty thick to begin with so i'm actually going to loosen this back up again with some water you could hit this with a stick blender too if you wanted it smoother i like it chunky my oven is heating to 400 fahrenheit 200 c and into a baking dish goes a good layer of tomato sauce enough so that once all the shells are in here displacing liquid they'll be up to their shoulders in sauce grab your parboiled shells and your filling some people load the filling in with a spoon i think that's a huge pain some people use a piping bag that'd work great but i hate loading piping bags i honestly see no problem with just smashing this in with your fingers then i like to position them cheese side up in the sauce so the cheese can brown a little bit here lauren's going to do a few it helps if you kind of smoosh them to expand that opening some people top this with some more tomato sauce and then some mozzarella i feel like that just turns this into a lasagna if i'm going to go through the work of filling individual shells i want to see individual shells i don't want this all to bake into a single mass some people bake it uncovered i like to cover it with foil and then let these steam cook in there for 15-20 minutes until they're bubbly and hey let's go full-on jersey shore and make some garlic bread with this the key is honestly just to use a huge amount of butter not one but two sticks of butter i softened in the microwave on low power that's half a pound 225 grams half a head of garlic chopped goes in there a whole bunch of pepper and then enough salt to make this taste a little too salty it's seasoning the bread remember this was salted butter so i don't need much more salt you could mix in herbs too but i prefer to sprinkle them on at the end that's enough garlic butter for a big baguette here's half of it cut in half and then you gotta really slather it on you want there to be enough to melt down through the bread as it cooks put it on tray the butter is gonna leak when the shells are cooked i'll just pull the foil off and turn on the broiler aka the grill and get a little color on the top if you just bake it uncovered the whole way i think it tends to come out kind of dry there you go i'll throw my garlic bread under the broiler for a few minutes just until it's brown and crispy some herbs on top chop into chunks nice and crispy since i made extra sauce i can kind of sauce the plate before i put on the shells if i have bread i like to have some extra sauce that i can mop up now i had 25 shells in that pan enough for four or five people to have a big dinner but i had enough filling and intact shells for 40 or 50 additional shells two of these pans cover them and freeze them without baking them first then all you gotta do when you get home from work is throw the frozen pan covered into a cold oven turn the heat on 400 fahrenheit 200c and walk away 45 minutes to an hour later it's both thawed and cooked be careful not to overcook the filling it'll get gritty it should be bubbling but still look kind of wet just pull the foil off turn on the broiler for a few minutes and there's dinner for whatever reason baked pasta dishes seem to get even better when they have been reheated now while i often describe italian american classics like this as big and sloppy like the tank top clad individuals who often prepare them i make an effort to keep mine kind of tight reduce the sauce nice and dry and don't put on too much the way my grandma would make this the plate would be flooded with orange water i like a drier firmer texture but you do you and one thing you can do is pre-order one of my summon forth the upside down bear t-shirts available on my bonfire store for just one more week as of the posting of this video the shirts should arrive december 8th through the 17th so it's a perfect gift link is in the description now put on a white tank

***RECIPE, MAKES...",29:02.6, this video is sponsored by skillshare it is surprisingly easy to make delicious bagels at home and it's worth it if like me you live in a place where you cannot buy a decent bagel you can make a ton at a time freeze them and have a homemade bagel for breakfast every morning let's dough two cups of warm water in a bowl that's a little less than 500 mils that much water makes a dozen bagels and i'll summon forth the upside down bear dump in a tablespoon of honey you can use sugar the traditional thing for new york style bagels i think is malted barley syrup which you can buy online i think honey is traditional in montreal the other north american bagel capital in goes at most a tablespoon of dry yeast stir everything up and let the yeast bloom for a few minutes mostly just to make sure it's still alive also because yeast blooming time lapse shots are fun to watch in goes salt i'm using a tablespoon of morton kosher my standard salt then you really want bread flour or the highest protein flour you can get i'm going to start with five cups that's like 650 grams but i really believe in stirring in a baseline rough measurement and then just kneading in more by feel flour absorbs more or less water depending on its protein content whether it's bleached how exactly it's been milled i'm sure a million other factors if you're going to follow a recipe to the gram like a robot you'd better hope that you're using the exact same flour as the person who wrote it used i'd rather just use my senses knead in flour until it feels right bagel dough should be dry like enough flour kneaded in so that by the time you have it smooth and elastic it's just barely sticky or some people say it shouldn't be sticky at all that's still pretty sticky that could be pizza dough i'll keep kneading in more flour and you do have to need a lot to get chewy bagels however i think the insane kneading that a lot of recipes call for is more about getting you an attractive smooth surface on the bagel making tasty bagels is pretty easy making cosmetically perfect bagels is real hard so maybe you know don't these are going to be kind of lumpy and i don't care that's still a little bit sticky the drier the dough the taller the bagel will be the bagel on the left there i made with a dough that was not sticky at all the bagel on the right i made with a dough that was still a little sticky pick your poison in my old age i think i'm liking thinner bagels more perhaps because i think they're better for egg sandwiches this is a slightly sticky dough back in the bowl it goes cover it up and check back when it's doubled in size this took an hour with my yeast in my kitchen climate it varies out she comes and divided into 12 balls however you want i'm rolling it out to a snake then i'll use scissors to snip it in half then into thirds and then those in half again 12 roughly equal lumps of dough to start by rolling them all out into balls again if you're concerned with cosmetics a thing that could help is to let the balls proof for 20 or 30 minutes at this stage the gluten kind of relaxes and then it stretches with a smoother surface but i don't care a couple of baking sheets dusted with flour or cornmeal or both i'm going to pick up one of these and just pinch a hole in the center then you gently stretch the hole open the hole's got to be way wider than you want it in the end because it's going to snap back a little immediately and the bagel is going to puff up once it cooks which will fill in the hole even more so start wide now you could just let these proof and get a little puffy on the counter for like a half hour or if you have the time cover them up and jam them on top of stuff in the fridge for many hours overnight a whole day or two slow fermentation in there really does result in superior flavor but do whatever you can got my oven heating here to 425 fahrenheit or 220c convection if you don't have a convection fan i'd go hotter 450. bagels taste like bagels and not just any ring-shaped bread because they are boiled before they're baked generally in a big deep pot though i'm using a skillet i'm using it because it's my widest pan which means i can boil more bagels at a time in it also it'll come up to a boil faster time to re-summon the bear big squeeze of honey into the boiling water or that barley syrup if you ordered some boiling in a slightly sweetened solution is what makes bagels shiny it enhances browning and you do taste it a little bit too when you got to a rolling boil you just dump in your bagels some people do like 30 seconds a side or a minute aside i'm doing two minutes per side more time boiling means chewier bagels and a thicker crust i do actually like to time it roughly with a stopwatch there just aren't a lot of visual clues to help you judge the time just flip them around and boil the other side another two minutes then i use a slotted spoon to pull them out to a rack you can't just put them back on the baking sheet but i find that letting them steam out on the rack helps to avoid soggy bottoms next batch goes in and here's the downside of using a shallow pan i felt that touched the bottom and stick a little bit you got to keep it moving to stop that from happening there's going to be water loss over the course of the boiling so you gotta remember to keep topping your pan off with water and a little more upside down bare brains out comes the last batch and there's our dozen time for toppings if the bagel is still wet and sticky you can just like dump it into a bowl of sesame seeds or whatever and smoosh it around and they will stick but they'll stick a lot better to the finished bagel as you're eating it if you glue on your toppings with egg wash just a beaten egg loosened up with a few drops of water brush it on or i think it's easier to dip the whole bagel in the bowl and then you can just scatter on the toppings if you dip it into the bowl of seeds you tend to get a lot of gloppy mess from the egg dripping off but i think the king of all bagel toppings is quote unquote everything bagel seasoning which has become quite popular in recent years for a good reason it is amazing you can buy it or you can mix it up yourself some pretty common proportions would be two parts coarse salt three parts dried onion flakes not onion powder also three parts dried garlic flakes the fine powders would burn in the oven three to four parts sesame seeds pretty common to use some black ones too just for pretty i'm only using them because i happen to have some and then like three parts poppy seeds and a lot of people would leave it there some people augment with a little caraway seed and or fennel seed i'm doing like one part caraway mix that together and it's ready for the bagels and another advantage of doing this on the racks is all of the excess can fall away if we topped these on the pans the excess toppings would burn in the oven and stink up the house you could probably bake these right on the sheets no problem but i'm using parchment paper just in case it makes sticking impossible and if possible put your plain ones on one tray and the others on another tray oh don't worry about me buddy get whatever you need nothing important happening in here anyway the bagels with toppings could actually use an extra couple of minutes in the oven so it's nice to keep them on a different tray if possible and these go to the oven they'll take about 20 minutes halfway through i'll rotate my pans exchange their positions though with my convection fan this isn't super necessary they bake pretty evenly regardless they're done when they're as brown as you want them and they feel kind of hard when you tap them though if you're planning to freeze most of these you might consider under baking them a tad which i've done here they'll brown a little bit more when you reheat them and toast them when they're right out of the oven they'll be steamy and delicious but i suppose i'm in the camp that believes bagels are best after they've rested for a while maybe even overnight and when they've cooled you can bag them and freeze them they'll thaw in like an hour on the counter or you can put a frozen solid bagel directly into the oven in this case a table top convection oven more popularly known by another name that i refuse to say because i think it's stupid five or six minutes in there and it's thawed and crispy if you cut it open and it still feels a little cold on the inside that's no big if you're planning to toast the cut sides say for an egg and cheese sandwich that's one beaten egg and a non-stick i usually just fold four sides over slightly and then flip that square of egg fits really well on a bagel just a

***BASIC...",29:02.6, spanish omelette known as tortilla in spain or maybe tortilla de patatas tortilla espanola tortilla just means little cake traditionally it's just eggs and potatoes and maybe onions what's particular about it is the way that you put them together it's not as tricky as a french omelet but it's a little tricky some things can go wrong i'm going to show you what i understand to be the traditional way of making this then i'll show you what you could call a slightly modernized method of making it then we'll go crazy and get creative with the flavors while still using the basic spanish omelette method start with the veggies one big onion or a couple of smaller ones purists might not even use the onion but i think the onion makes it cut them thin in whatever shape i do quarter moons then about a pound of waxy potatoes 450 grams or so peel them if you want to i think the skins of waxy varieties taste good and they're nutritious with big potatoes you might cut them into quarters before slicing them but with little potatoes like these i'll just slice them into whole rounds thin but not paper thin if they're too thin they'll break apart before they even get into the omelet that might seem like a huge amount of stuff for an omelette but the potatoes are going to shrink in half the onions will shrink to almost nothing and the filling to egg ratio with the spanish omelet is about one to one traditional way of doing this is to pre-fry the fillings in olive oil fully submerged in oil shallow deep frying i see no reason to drop the onions into hot oil you could splash yourself the onions are gonna cook slowly so we can bring the heat in after we put them in safely medium heat on my stove but every stove is different you might need it higher on a gas stove we're trying to gently fry these until they go sweet the goal is to caramelize the onion so you don't want to see anything browning yet once i've given the onions a five minute head start i'll put in the potatoes and these i will gently lift in with a spoon a few at a time number one so that i don't splash boiling oil on myself number two so that i don't overflow my pan via displacement you can see none other than marco pierre white doing just that while making a spanish omelette in one of his nor stock cube videos some people do this frying step in an entirely different vessel in a tall pot i don't think it's necessary to get another thing dirty as long as we're more cautious about it than marco once the potatoes are in it'll take another 10 or 15 minutes of gentle frying depending on how thin you cut your potatoes stir it every now and then to make sure things are cooking evenly but while you're waiting you can crack your eggs into a big mixing bowl for this much veg i'd say six to eight eggs depending on how big they are this is going to feed at least four people give those a good beating before you put in the fillings some traditional recipes say don't ever let anything brown some say get a little browning right at the end and i'm in that camp it's done when everything has a little bit of color and you can see some potatoes just starting to break apart those onions got 20 minutes total cooking time so they should now be very sweet which to me is the entire charm of a spanish omelet now we got to strain this you could simply lift everything out with a slotted spoon but we need to get the oil out of the pan anyway so i've got a sieve over a heat proof jug you're not going to have a free hand to hold the sieve so make sure that the sieve sits securely over your vessel all by itself there's our leftover oil here's our piping hot fried vegetables and they have to go directly into the eggs stir immediately and aggressively this is key to spanish omelette you're using the heat from the fillings to start the eggs cooking i'll stir it for a couple of minutes just like if i was stirring hot cream into egg yolks for a custard if you don't stir the egg in direct contact with the fillings will curdle prematurely now salt for this much i would do like three quarters to one teaspoon of salt you could take my word for it or you could taste the eggs are still pretty raw so there's some possibility of foodborne illness make your own risk to reward calculations all right my non-stick pan is still on medium heat could you make this in a well-seasoned cast iron pan i never have successfully it sticks hopelessly every time i'm sure it's possible spanish omelette pre-dates teflon if you're a real cast iron cowboy go for it but a dish like this is the whole reason i keep a teflon pan around once the mix is in i'll immediately turn my heat down to low you've got to let this cook really gently to get the interior at least two-thirds of the way cooked before we flip it if the heat is too high the bottom will burn while you wait i'm doing a pretty thin tortilla here and even then it takes me four or five minutes of cooking before i can flip it if you go to the wikipedia page for spanish omelette you can see how thick some people do these i can't imagine how long that takes some people transfer these to the oven i think that defeats the entire point of the technique if you want to bother heating up your oven just broil the top and call it a frittata frittatas are way easier okay so when you shake the pan and you can see that it's like two-thirds or three-quarters of the way cooked inside you can go around the edge and make sure nothing is stuck and then you put a plate over the pan then you flip the whole assembly ideally your plate is at least an inch wider than your pan and mine isn't which is why i got some leakage there pan goes back on the heat and then you just slide the omelette back in i like to crank the heat back up to medium we don't have to cook this for as long on this side and i want some nice color at this point the omelette is solid enough that you can actually lift it up and have a peek without breaking it that looks good now a fresh clean plate goes on top again and we turn it out one more time this allows the hotter side to steam out before we eat it and i like this very well rested in a tapas restaurant they might even serve it lukewarm the taste of that is really sweet surprisingly sweet and the texture is pillowy like a big cushy mattress of egg much like the big cushy mattress of

get two free pillows link is in the description thank you helix now this right here is my main problem with the traditional spanish omelette recipe all that used oil in a spanish household they might cook three tortillas a week so they're going to reuse this oil i am not so here's what i do instead just a normal coating of a nice olive oil in my pan in go my two medium sized onions over medium heat and when you caramelize onions in just a little fat you have to stir them almost constantly if you don't individual pieces or parts of pieces would be burned by the time the rest was caramelized they've had their five-minute head start now in goes my pound of sliced potatoes again i'll stir almost constantly just taking a quick break to break my half dozen eggs into my mixing bowl caramelizing everything this way does involve about 20 minutes of near-constant stirring but to me it's worth it to not have to strain out the fry oil and find some appropriate way to reuse it if it seems like you maybe gave your onions a little too long of a head start like they're getting too brown before the potatoes have cooked soft just pour in a little bit of water this is a really common technique when caramelizing onions if you have some pieces that are looking a little crispy and threatening to burn sauteing the veg rather than frying it gives you more flexibility and control in this respect don't worry all that water will boil out before we put this into the eggs the potatoes are starting to break apart they're cooked so in the hot fillings go straight into my eggs and i'll stir them for a few minutes to get both the fillings and their heat distributed evenly throughout a teaspoon of kosher salt the reason i specify kosher is not because the grain size matters it doesn't you can use whatever salt you want the salt is going to dissolve i specify because different grain sizes measure differently big grains like kosher occupy a greater volume of space a teaspoon of kosher salt is equal to about three quarters of a teaspoon of table salt by weight adjust for whatever kind of salt you're using why not just weigh the salt because kitchen scales tend to be super inaccurate when it comes to differences of just a few grams remember i reduced my heat to low or medium low right after i put the eggs in and after four or five minutes it's at least two thirds of the way cooked through time to flip and don't flip it right over the burner i was doing that to keep everything in the light and in the focal plane but yeah you're gonna get some drippage especially if your plate isn't quite big enough for the job the fillings underneath tend to bunch up a bit when you slide the omelette back in you can even them out by just swishing the omelet around in the pan that works very well i'm on medium heat again because the second side takes less time and i want some nice color on it like that let it cool thoroughly and the texture of this is really reminiscent of a potato gratin it has that satisfying al dente feel as you bite through the layers you wouldn't get that if you slice the potatoes paper thin and i can perceive zero difference in texture or taste compared to the traditional version where we fried the fillings so now let's be totally unbound by tradition and get creative i'm going to slice up one medium onion and the rest of my onion will be green onions i've already taken off the decaying outer layers i'm just slicing the white parts thin and i'll caramelize those with the rest the green parts i'll slice diagonally to make them pretty and i'll put those in at the last second hence keeping them separate i'm going to use a sweet potato this time i'm still trying to like them they're pretty and they're far better for you it's big so i've cut it into quarters before slicing thin sweet potato with caramelized onions is gonna be pretty sweet so let's balance that with some fresh red chilies these are mild ones so i'll slice them seeds and all and i'll chop up a little bit of rosemary i'll caramelize my onions as before stirring almost constantly in a little olive oil over medium heat after a five minute head start in go my potato slices stir stir stir when they seem about halfway cooked i'll put my sliced chilies in when the potatoes are just starting to break i'll put in my rosemary and some spice this is harissa the great traditional spice blend of north africa tons of cultural exchange between north africa and spain obviously i'll let that fry for a minute before stirring hot into my half dozen beaten eggs stir for a couple minutes to distribute the heat in with only a half teaspoon of salt this time because i'm going to grate in some of this manchego the iconic firm cheese of spain it's quite salty like parmesan hence less salt in go my green onion tops at the last second to keep them green and firm stir those in back into the pan on medium heat back it down to low when it's mostly cooked through i'll turn it out onto the plate whoops that one got a little bit toasty but nobody has to know because we're flipping this one more time after just a couple of minutes back up on medium heat beautiful let it cool slice her up and check this out rosemary flowers totally edible tastes like rosemary i would never spend money for something this precious but they're growing on my plant outside right now i'm either going to eat them or let them rot off so i'll eat them they're super pretty so there you go there's the spanish omelette technique keep it super traditional or you know don't

Facebook: @NationalPorkBoard...",29:02.6, this video is sponsored by the national pork board lordy i love the cuisine of mexico and i love paying someone else to cook it for me because it's so much work an authentic mole poblano for example involves about 30 ingredients and hours and hours of cooking but what i've tried to do here is reimagine this great classic sauce as a quick pan sauce for a quick weeknight pork tenderloin i know it sounds crazy but bear with me mole just means sauce mole poblano being the sauce from the state of puebla it's famous here in the u.s because it has chocolate something not often used in savory dishes here and as a result i find its taste very transporting when you can't travel cook i say and pork can be your passport so many of the great dishes of mexico and tons of other cultures are built around this beautiful meat and the meat can take you there pork is your passport to the great cuisines of the world hop on board and go of course many of those dishes involve cooking the meat for a really long time but this right here is one of my favorite weeknight cuts of meat the pork tenderloin the most underrated source of lean protein at the store why beef tenderloin is so expensive and this is not i'll never understand it cooks in a flash it's tender as all get out and it's an ideal substrate for any flavorful sauce like our mole which i've already started by the way with a few big garlic cloves and a shallot or two just crush and peel the garlic cloves no need to chop them onions would obviously be traditional but shallots are great for pan sauces because the layers are thin so they cook super quickly plus i don't need a whole onion's worth i'm only making two or three portions this tenderloin requires only one little bit of prep and that is to trim off that silver skin there that is not fat it's connective tissue it won't melt the easy way to do this is just slip under it with a little knife don't try to get it all in one go just do a little strip at a time and pull it up as you just shave underneath the rest once that end is loose grab it taut and shave down the other side you don't have to get every little molecule of this off just trim off most of it and i would not trim anything else there's hardly an ounce of fat on this thing i'll just season it with pepper and salt and i recommend a non-stick pan or a well-seasoned cast iron like i've got here on medium heat a good amount of whatever oil you like to sear with this is avocado oil and the thing about tenderloin is it's very tender it's soft so the outside tends to get beat up and shred a little bit when it sticks to the pan i'm avoiding this by constantly moving it around with my tongs i'm not giving it a chance to stick i just imagine sweeping around the oil with the meat until the protein structure on that side is seared firm this is a technique that a lot of people use when cooking really delicate fish fillets they'll shake the pan underneath the fish continuously until it's browned same exact concept here notice that it didn't fit in the pan before but it fits now meat contracts after five minutes i've got a good sear on all sides and now i'll take my heat down to medium low and dump in my garlic and shallots for traditional mole these would get roasted a long time so you want to get them going early now i'm going to import a french idea and drop in some butter for pan roasting this meat we'll just baste it continuously until it's done the french would do that with a spoon probably i find you get the exact same result by just continuously flipping the meat around and mopping up the butter with it this is a tenderloin from a local organic producer i really love and it's a little on the small side it's a pound even if you have a much bigger one you might find it easier to transfer this pan to the oven i used to always do that with pork tenderloin but honestly it's just not necessary to heat up the oven if you've got the time to kind of mother this in the pan just tossing it around to get even heat on all sides getting some good color in the garlic there i can feel the pork getting kind of rigid so i know it's about cooked inside i'll take its temperature and i'm looking for 145 fahrenheit or 63c that will give you pork tenderloin that's still a little pink like that and you absolutely can do that with modern american pork totally safe to eat after it rests for a few minutes that was in the pan for 15 minutes total okay a mole would traditionally be made with an array of dried chilies that you toast and then slowly rehydrate we don't have time for that so i'm putting in two canned chipotle peppers only two go easy or these will be the only thing you taste these are smoked chilies and while that's definitely a different flavor than a toasted dried chili it really does fulfill the same function it gives you that dark musky backbone to the sauce straight out of a little can now traditionally you toast and grind a whole array of nuts and seeds pumpkin seeds peanuts probably owing to african influence on mexican food but we can get a similar effect much faster if we borrow a page from southeast asian cuisine and simply fry a little bit of peanut butter or tahini any nut or seed paste you have just fry it for a sec now if you have a little square of mexican chocolate throw that in i'm just gonna put in some cocoa powder act that was a little too much just a little bit is what you want the cocoa nibs for mexican chocolate are generally roasted really dark and again we can simulate that by simply frying our cocoa a little bit okay now spices you could use some combination of any of these a little ground coriander cumin dried oregano a tiny pinch of cinnamon and even tinier pinch of cloves now to thicken this you traditionally put in some stale corn tortilla and or slices of white bread you just fry them and then stew them to let their starches gelatinize the sauce that's a genius use of leftover food but you really can get a very similar effect with just a little pinch of flour you let it fry to get you that toasty flavor that you would get from toasting the bread of the tortilla and then the last thing because it tends to burn is a little squeeze of tomato paste a mole like this might have some roasted tomatoes in it we can get a similar effect by simply frying a little tomato paste until it goes kind of rusty brown and it is time to deglaze traditionally you might ladle in the broth from where your meat is slow simmering but water is totally fine for our purposes we have all that fond in there from when we seared our pork tenderloin just scrape it up with your spoon i'll simmer that for a few minutes to extract flavor out of the solids and gelatinize the flour i would err on the side of reducing this down too thick because you could always water it down right before you spoon it over the meat and mole is generally very thick mole poblano generally has some kind of sugar in it to balance the bitterness of the chocolate it also usually has some dried fruits like raisins simmering in there for hours we don't have time for that but we do have this a big spoonful of any fruit preserve this is some local fig preserves this will get us the sugar we need plus a little fruity flavor not quite what you get from dried fruit but a preserve has a deeper flavor than fresh fruit give it a taste and see if it needs more salt or sugar or anything and you could eat this chunky or you could puree it i'm gonna strain it or am i going to puree it when you use a metal sieve like this and really grind into it with a wooden spoon you really are kind of pureeing it just make sure you scrape off all the puree sticking to the underside all that's left is skin and seeds and there is our weeknight mole i've given my pan a cursory rinse back on medium heat and i'll put in maybe a tablespoon of toasted sesame oil very potent stuff and into that a six ounce bag of frozen solid lima beans don't worry they'll fall in a couple of minutes in here frozen limas are way better than canned i think this is a very simplified version of one of the best vegetable sides i ever had in my life it was from a place in louisville kentucky called mayan cafe you just stir these for a few minutes until they start to brown pinch of salt grind of pepper optionally the zest of a lime make sure to give that grater a tap and then not optional is the juice of said lime also a teeny pinch of sugar in place of caramelized onions if you've got it a handful of fresh parsley or cilantro right at the end and we're ready to eat slice up that tenderloin it's just the perfect amount of meat for a protein heavy meal for two or three or mom and dad plus little kids our limey lima beans go on and now that weeknight mole poblano i believe we took a very different route to a pretty similar destination with that you often see this sauce garnished with some toasted sesame seeds and i'm very pleased with that that pork is so juicy and tender even if you think you don't like lima beans try these the sesame oil just makes them come alive and the lime really complements the sweet mole 35 minutes of weeknight cooking and i feel like i've taken a 1 500 mile plane flight thanks again to the national pork board for their sponsorship bring flavor to everyday

Yeast...",29:02.6, it is absolutely possible to do restaurant quality garlic naan at home without a tan door in a pan on the stove any stove we're not even going to use the oven i'm not going to lie i had quite a few hilarious fails before i got this method down but i mean the results speak for themselves first dough a fascinating thing about indian style breads is the diversity of leaveners used this right here is probably the original one curd yogurt crucially yogurt containing live active bacterial cultures you mix this into some flour and in time they will puff it up a bit then we got the dried yeast and then finally chemical leaveners baking soda and baking powder here's the book from which i first started learning about indian cooking over 20 years ago and her non recipe calls for all the leaveners all three kinds it's like millennia of baking history all piled up in one place and for years i've baked this recipe by simply cooking the naan under the broiler on a pizza stone and that gets you a very tasty little flatbread but it is not the non that i know and love from indian restaurants that is i've had much better luck getting that effect with a no yeast dough two cups of all-purpose flour like 250 grams that's enough for four loaves a teaspoon of sugar enhances browning i might just do half a teaspoon of salt you could want more but i prefer to top mine on with some more salt at the end a teaspoon of baking powder double acting baking powder i think that helps the texture and then just a scant quarter teaspoon of baking soda to neutralize the yogurt that's coming after a couple of tablespoons of any oil you want i'm using olive oil about a quarter cup of yogurt 60 grams or so then just enough milk or water to bring this together i started with half a cup like 100 mils and then i ended up kneading in maybe 50 more most western dough recipes including my own generally tell you to start with an overly wet dough and to keep kneading in flour until the texture is right every indian dough recipe i've seen does the opposite they start dry and then knead in liquid and the right texture for this is nice and soft but just barely sticky it's drier than pizza dough it should be just a little sticky and the gluten is developed enough when it kind of bounces back at you like that i'll oil this to keep it from drying out and it's a quick bread you could cook it right now it would taste okay but you wouldn't get very many bubbles i've found that you need to let it sit for at least a half hour under a wet towel but it gets better with time leave it for many hours if you can okay now let me show you a version with yeast almost the same as before a couple of cups of flour a teaspoon of sugar half teaspoon of salt teaspoon of dry yeast to bloom it if you want to be safe and a little baking powder too half a teaspoon most non-recipes with yeast seem to call for some baking powder as well i don't fully understand how they interact but there's a few great threads about that topic on pizzamaking.com i've linked those in the description a couple of tablespoons of olive oil and this is important just a little yogurt like a tablespoon too much yogurt and yeast together and it becomes a cake not a bread i think it's all the acidity weakening the gluten structure a little more milk or water this time because we have less moisture from the yogurt i think i did a cup total until i got the right texture remember smooth soft but only slightly sticky like any yeast bread this has to rise for at least an hour at room temperature here's the no yeast version after a couple of hours and to my surprise it has puffed up a bit i'm not sure the extent to which that's the chemical leavening or the live bacteria in the yogurt but lots of indian no yeast naan recipes tell you to leave it for many hours in a warm place i think they're depending on those bacteria in the curd if you don't need this a little bit more shortly before you cook it the naan tends to blow up one huge bubble my goal is three or four smaller bubbles hence the last minute kneading and there's our four dough balls ready to bake i really admire folks who could manage this much effort to make a side dish for a typical weeknight meal i can't this is a special occasion thing for me and on a given week night i'm much more likely to cook with the sponsor of this video hellofresh

and code in the description thank you hellofresh okay let's bake our no yeast naan some people roll this out with flour i've found that it's a lot easier to just let it stick to my counter the sticking helps it keeps the dough steady and stops it from immediately snapping back the way you keep it from sticking to the rolling pin is to simply roll outward and off outward and off that's instead of rolling it back and forth if you did it back and forth it would stick i think the perfect thickness is just slightly less than the thinnest you could possibly roll it now garlic small differences can be very big in a simple food in this case i'm talking about how you cut the garlic i grated this garlic which i gather is one of the traditional methods here chopped garlic gives you pebbly pieces that tend to fall out of the bread thin stringy pieces from a grater or from a garlic press seem to adhere a lot better crushing it with salt would give you a similar effect as well thin stringy pieces that stick well to the dough a little fresh chopped cilantro as well this is like pizza you can top it with whatever you want be more creative than me but one thing that i really like is this traditional method of rolling the toppings into the dough this really embeds them makes them part of the bread while still maintaining some heterogeneity last step right before you cook it is to wet the bottom side a little bit this dissolves the surface starch and creates a sticky layer of literal paste that you would use to make this stick to the inside wall of a tan door which is a vertical oven in our case we want it to stick to a cast iron skillet on medium heat every stove is different i've found that medium or a little less than medium is the right temperature on my stove but that took experimentation to find out to do this method an indian cook might use a flat round griddle pan called a tawa it's a pan with no sides i found that my cast iron skillet works pretty well too stainless steel has not done as well for me but maybe you could make it work this method depends on the dough sticking to the pan so we can't un-stick it to check the bottom we just have to guess when it's cooked and that took me a lot of practice after just a minute or two you should see some bubbles blowing up i am not sure the extent to which those bubbles are from the double-acting baking powder reacting at high heat to make carbon dioxide or if they are simply steam from inside or underneath the dough i suspect it's mostly steam since lots of recipes don't use baking powder at all only baking soda to react with the acid and the yogurt that reaction happened instantaneously two hours ago so i think this is mostly steam inflating bubbles that were initially created by the chemical leaveners though my experiments indicate that the double acting baking powder also helps to aerate the texture a bit after a couple of minutes you should see the edges starting to look dry and cooked i've also had good success using my nose to tell when the bottom is done basically at the first tiny whiff of a burned smell it's time to cook the top for standard tawa naan you would invert the pan and then cook it over the open flame of a gas stove but i found that it works just as well with a cast iron skillet and just as well on my electric resistance coil stove i just jack the heat all the way to high and rest the upside down pan right over the burner the only kind of stove this wouldn't work on is an induction stove because induction doesn't heat the air i'll give the induction folks an option later i want to see some smoke coming out my goal is to get some singeing on the bubbles while the rest of the surface should still look almost raw that is key to the restaurant style nan that i'm familiar with parts of the surface should still be quite doughy that is done and if you're thinking it doesn't look like naan yet that's because you're missing the final ingredient a generous brushing of melted butter at the end i'm using salted butter to complement the slightly under seasoned dough the final remaining challenge is to unstick the bread from the pan it'd be a lot easier to scrape this out of a tawa which has no sides to get in your way and yeah this one is going to stick on me you know what i realized i baked like 59 in a weekend to prep for this video and i'd really messed up the seasoning coat on my cast iron so i did a very quick re-seasoning clean pan on high a little spray of oil wipe it thin let it burn until it stops smoking once i had an okay seasoning layer again my non started sticking when i wanted it to stick and releasing when i wanted it to release ironically the starch paste glue on the bottom tended to not stick well enough when i tried this in a stainless steel pan my non just fell out much better results in the cast iron a little too much color on that one but nice this tawa style naan is amazing at replicating the effect of a tandoor if we simply cooked it in a pan in oil it would taste like fried bread but this tastes baked because the bottom cooked on that little layer of starch paste instead of fat and the top simply cooked in very hot dry air that gets you crispy bubbles and a baked flavor you could maybe replicate that effect by transferring the pan under a very hot broiler to brown the top but you know it doesn't work blasting it with a kitchen torch i thought that might work but all it did was burn the garlic now for some reason the no yeast dough seems to work better for tawa style naan most recipes for tawanon that i've seen call for no yeast i'll show you what the yeast dough does with this method i'll knead it again after a couple hours of rising divide it into balls and then proof them for a little bit at least 15 minutes to get a second release of gas oh by the way you have to give the pan a very quick wash and dry after each non that you cook a lot of residue from the previous naan could interfere with the sticking process back to my yeast dough i'll roll one out and top it as before wet the bottom to make it sticky on the pan it goes and for me the yeast dough just tends to puff up evenly lots of tiny little bubbles all the way through i'm not getting any giant bubbles that will go crisp when i invert the pan and brown the top i've also found that for some reason the yeast dough doesn't stick quite as securely yeah well anyways brush that with butter perfect color on the bottom there i would say the flavor of this one is superior because yeast fermentation is delicious but the texture is inferior it's like a western dinner roll it doesn't have those crisp filo-esque bubbly layers maybe it takes the intense heat of a tandoor to get that from a yeast dough with the tawa style method i would absolutely do the no yeast dough again now what if you have an induction stove or what if you're simply too scared to do the whole pan inversion move well you absolutely can cook the bread until it's done on the bottom and then just flip it just brown the other side a little bit a little bit more than that but not too much more i think a key to any naan is letting the surface remain a little doughy that looks okay the texture's not as good as if we'd cooked the top with hot air but it still tastes like naan because we cooked it without oil it tastes baked and not fried so if you're feeling brave give this tawa style method a shot again it really took me a lot of practice and i've hardly mastered it but the results are pretty extraordinary
Chana masala — Indian-style chickpeas in spicy gravy,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iKMI1xkU_oo/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLBDJrxt8EgIqZUMij8GHB4e-HSJ4g,iKMI1xkU_oo,"10 minutes, 36 seconds","Thanks to Fetch Rewards for sponsoring this video! Download the app now and use the code RAGUSEA to get 2,000 points when you scan your first receipt! → https://fetch.thld.co/araguseasep...",29:02.6, chana masala chickpeas and a spicy gravy one of my favorite meatless dishes of all time it's cheap it's nutritious it's a great thing for meal prep totally the kind of thing that i would freeze in ice cube trays so that i can easily thaw out the exact quantity i want for a weeknight dinner i'm sure there's a million ways to make this dish but my concept of it obviously is shaped by my life eating in north indian style restaurants in the united states and i think i got pretty close to that taste with the more complicated version i'm gonna show you later but first here's gotta be the easiest possible way to make this nothing but pantry ingredients all of which are available in standard western supermarkets we will do no chopping get a little saucepan and put in some oil ghee would be great if you have it but i'm just using olive oil and i'll put in a heaped tablespoon of any store-bought garam masala any pre-ground pre-mixed indian spice blend that you've got is fine and i will just fry that in the oil until i can really smell it another great pantry staple right here these little teeny cans of diced chilies tons of flavor in my research i noticed that two parts cooked chickpeas to one part tomatoes is a pretty common ratio use whatever canned tomato product you like i really like this brand here in the states and they make a different one that is fire roasted this is a pantry champion right here tons of deep flavors straight out of the can and you could totally chop up a bunch of onion and garlic and ginger yourself or you could simply take them in powdered form a big teaspoon each of garlic and onion powder and yes ground ginger this is a common thing in western pantries where it's used to make gingerbread persons at christmas time but seriously if you give it time to rehydrate it tastes surprisingly like fresh ginger in a sauce or stew i'll drain out two cans of chickpeas the liquid is just too starchy too gluey but you could put in some of it if you wanted in those go along with enough water to get everything covered might as well clean out the tomato can in the process canned products like these are often already pretty salty so i wouldn't put in any salt just yet just bring that to a simmer stir it every now and then and in 20 or 30 minutes you'll see the liquid has thickened up nicely that's the starch from the chickpeas gelatinizing have a taste and make sure to actually taste a chickpea if you only taste the gravy you'll probably end up under seasoning this because the chickpeas are bland some salt in there and a lot of people put in lemon juice to brighten this at the end i'll keep this pure pantry and just use some neutral vinegar that's rice vinegar and yeah i said no chopping but if you have some fresh coriander leaves also known as cilantro in my hemisphere those are nice to stir in at the last second before you pour this over rice now is that the best chana masala ever no but it's pretty good and it was stupid easy and cheap but let's try it the hard way now or a harder way in the states people like me refer to any chickpea masala as chana masala but chana is a specific kind of chickpea and this is them they're kind of small and i think they have much nicer texture if you buy them dry a cup and a half will equal what you would get from two of those 14 ounce cans by weight it's 500 grams dry you don't have to pre-soak them but it helps them cook faster and more evenly just cover them by a couple of inches i did this first thing in the morning and here they are in the afternoon plumped up quite a bit and while those are soaking you can make your own masala a fresh spice mixture and this will require ingredients from my local indo-pak grocery which reminds me i need to scan my receipt into fetch rewards the sponsor of this video fetch is

will put a teaspoon of cumin seeds half a teaspoon of coriander seeds half a teaspoon of black peppercorns half a teaspoon of mustard seeds a black cardamom pod a tiny scrap of a cinnamon stick and half a teaspoon of fenugreek seeds i will turn my heat on medium and toast these until i can smell them you do not have to make your own masala but it does taste better it gives you creative control i have no idea if any of this is traditional i just play with different indian spices whenever i do this and if you buy whole spices they last forever in your pantry so it doesn't matter that i only make indian food like once a month they're gonna last once these have cooled i will load them into the coffee grinder that i use for spices and i will pulse that until smooth there that's a heaped tablespoon of fresh masala okay now's a good time to get our chana cooking you could discard the soaking water there's some research that says that maybe a quarter of the indigestible starches that give you gas are in the water but lately i've been cooking my beans in the soaked water i'll just top it off with a little more there's good nutrition in there and probably some flavor and texture if i take two pills of an alpha galactosidase supplement with dinner i'm fine a lot of indian cooks put in some baking soda sodium bicarb that makes them cook like twice as fast but i also think it makes the texture a little slimy for my taste and apparently it destroys a lot of the vitamin b i'll just put in some salt probably a teaspoon for this much salt accelerates cooking too just not as much and it seasons the inside i don't cover the pan i prefer to have it open so i can see what's happening to make sure the water level doesn't drop too low in which case they'd stick to the bottom and burn a lot of indian cooks would use a pressure cooker you could totally do that but these are only going to take like half an hour in there i like to finish cooking them in the sauce that we're gonna make while those boil okay an onion lots of indian recipes say three onions i think their onions are way smaller than mine like three big fresh tomatoes you could totally just use one of those 14 ounce cans instead a couple of chilies these are serranos but use whatever kind you like you could use the canned ones if you wanted a few big garlic cloves and a real big thumb of ginger you want to cheat and use a prepared ginger garlic paste from the indian grocery go for it i'm going to puree this sauce which means that i can do some particularly unschooled chopping even for me just clank it up into chunks you could scrape the ribs out of your chilis if you want to limit the heat or don't peel and chop that garlic peel this ginger this next part goes so much faster if you use your widest frying pan instead of a narrow tall pot you'll see why you could use some oil again but i got a jar of ghee from the indo pack the rich flavor of that really shines through in this dish in goes my fresh masala on medium heat oh and also some turmeric without that the color can be kind of drab fry that until you really smell it and then it's nice to give the garlic and ginger a head start just to get a little color on it but basically as soon as i'm scared things are going to burn in goes all the other veg i want to emphasize that even though i'm calling this the hard version of chana masala i'm still showing you a significantly simplified and streamlined recipe that i have synthesized from the various ones i've researched indian food is freaking complicated a lot of people would fry these vegetables kind of one at a time i think you can get away with doing it all at once though if you stir it constantly and get some color on them after you've evaporated off most of the water and that will happen way faster in a giant frying pan with tons of surface area alrighty things are browning to the point where ugg my fond is gonna burn in with a little water and just enough water to clean out the inside of that pan and not leave any goodness behind as i dump this into the food processor you could use any kind of blender just get it as smooth as possible i think in a lot of restaurants they would push that through a fine mesh strainer to get out all the various bits of cellulose you could do that if you want your gravy silky smooth i'm not going to bother fiber is good hey i think my china are already you can just taste them to assess i think you want them to be just tender before they go into the sauce i've given my big pan a cursory wash and in with some more ghee and some more spices this time the whole spices that i don't want to send through the blender those are green cardamom pods insanely delicious things and some bay leaves if you have them maybe they'll actually do something i doubt it when i can smell the cardamom i'm going to fry a big squeeze of tomato paste you don't have to use this but it adds some strength of flavor a nice red color and that is going to burn that is going to burn that's a close one once that is all stirred together i can put in my channa and since i was conservative about the quantity of water i boiled them in i now don't have to worry about lifting them out of that water i'm going to want at least this much water in the finished dish so everything goes in i'm going to let these simmer in there for at least 15 minutes again to let that starch from the chickpeas gelatinize in the sauce for finishing flavors again lemon juice would be great to brighten it up but check this out amchor these are dried mango slices you can buy them powdered but again i prefer to buy whole indian spices so they last longer for me just get that as fine as possible this is going to be my finishing acid it is super tart stuff but it's also got all these funky aromatic notes it's my new favorite thing it just needs a couple of minutes to rehydrate in there give that a taste i'ma do what i know the restaurants do and put in a big pinch of sugar no shame and some more salt and i can already tell that as this cools i'm gonna need to water it down like anything thickened with starch this will thicken a lot as it cools to eating temperature don't ask me why i transferred that to a different pot long story but yeah it needed a fair bit more water and of course some handfuls of fresh cilantro right at the end oh you want to know how i made my rice i know this method has become a bit of an internet controversy of late but honestly try boiling basmati rice as if it were pasta big pot of boiling water heavily salted just dump the rice in no need to rinse it first the starch coat will wash off in there after 15 minutes tops it'll be done you just fish some out with a fork and have a taste dump it into a strainer drain it let it steam off for a minute and if you like fluffy separate rice grains this method is simply foolproof now is starting from scratch with dried chana really worth it holy crap i was not ready for what a big difference this makes the texture of those is just outstanding they're like caviar the flavor of that sauce is super rich and sophisticated i love those whole green cardamom pods floating around in there i just eat them are you supposed to eat them i always have don't eat the bay leaves though they can poke your insides anyway there you go a simple version and a simplified but still kind of complicated version combine ideas from both it's just chickpeas and a spicy tomato sauce do it however you want it's great
Five things to do with extra pizza dough,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fcQfyimnF7E/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLDKUfUQNwiu5GJM_7txsU513hwg0Q,fcQfyimnF7E,"10 minutes, 2 seconds",Thanks to Haus for sponsoring this video! The first 100 people to purchase two bottles of Haus using my link http://bit.ly/haus_adamragusea2 and my code ADAMRAGUSEA2 will get $10 off and free...,29:02.6, five things to do with leftover pizza dough i always make extra dough because it's basically the same amount of work to make four portions as it is to make one things i'm going to show you could work with any dough recipe my standard one is in the description and the only unusual thing about it is i like to knead it up portion it into individual oiled containers and put it straight into the fridge i let it cold ferment for many days maybe a week and here's how it comes out i usually go around the edge gently pulling it away from the glass i want to lift it out while deflating it as little as possible and perhaps the most obvious thing to do with leftover pizza dough is make garlic knots you take your dough try to get it into a reasonably even rectangle and then slice that into strips there's a million ways to tie these but you can simply take a strip cross the ends over send one up the middle and you've got a garlic knot i once saw this young lady making these at a restaurant and she did this rad move where she'd pick up the strip wrap it around two fingers twice and then send the excess through she did like one every second that way not sure i did that right if you're feeling really unconfident you can totally just do this down on the board cross two ends over send one end through and what to do with the other end well you could just leave it dangling out it would cook darker and crispier than the rest which would be a nice texture contrast or if you're not into that you could simply tuck it under oh we should probably place these directly onto our baking sheet as we shape them that's just some parchment paper i have on there not necessary now these are looking pretty big they're going to double in size make yours as big as you want but i think i want little knots i'm going to start cutting these strips in half before i tie them if the dough is sticking to you really bad you could lubricate your hands with water flour or oil depending on what kind of finish you want on your little breadlets i want a crispy brown crust so i'm going to work these with oil on my hands that's what oil will do to the surface in the oven i'm going to need two trays so i might as well put the big ones together and the little ones together that way the big ones can bake a little longer i'll proof those for about a half hour that is give the yeast time to raise them one last time in their final form that'll help them bake up a little area and i don't think they need to be covered that coating of oil should form a water safe barrier to keep them from drying out over that time garlic knots are coated in a heavily seasoned oil or butter some people brush that on before they go in the oven but i think that just gets you a seasoned dinner roll i'm gonna bake these dry at 400 fahrenheit 200 c for probably 20 minutes that's plenty of time to peel and chop like half a head of garlic and a big fistful of fresh parsley a stick of butter goes into that little sauce pan i prefer to make this with olive oil but my wife prefers butter so we're doing butter i'll melt that on like medium high heat scrape in the garlic and then just turn the heat off it does not have to cook very much and you certainly don't want to burn it in goes a bunch of whatever other seasonings you want i'll do pepper a pinch of chili flakes some dried oregano not yet with the fresh parsley i'll give that a taste you might think that it needs salt especially if you used unsalted butter but i say hold off on the salt for now okay some people bake these until they're just set but still kind of pale that will get you nice soft garlic knots i prefer to bake them until they're getting quite brown like that they might seem too hard at this stage and they are but they're not going to stay that way in these go to a bowl ideally while still warm and i'll pour in much of my seasoned butter i'll hold back a little just in case they don't need it then just stir and stir for a minute give them time to absorb that stuff i'll grate in some cheese i do this now so it doesn't get too hot and go grainy likewise i'll put in parsley after things have cooled down a little bit to keep it green and there you go between the cheese and the salted butter i used those are almost salty enough but i'll hit them with some more the butter will make the salt stick garlic knots are classically an appetizer and if you start with breadlets that are baked a little too hard they won't go mushy as they sit around soaking in the butter or oil as people peck on them before dinner you know it's also great to have before dinner and a pair of teeth from house the sponsor of this video house is this really exciting farm to glass aperitif maker in california it's a family business let's see what flavors i got citrus flour that was my favorite last time ooh ginger yuzu aperitifs aren't super common here in the u.s it's something you traditionally drink as you're hanging out with your friends waiting for dinner to be served it's relatively low alcohol and flavored to excite the palette yum great brandy from sonoma county raw sugar orange peel lemongrass yuzu from california just super refreshing and creative that is you can make cocktails with them whatever will the asian flavors in this particular one clash with something like garlic knots no those are like long lost cousins reunited but house is an anytime drink i don't always have it before dinner it's just a lovely thing to sip on whenever the first 100 of you can get 10 off and free shipping on your house essentials kit just hit my link in the description and use my code adamergucia2 thank you house okay second thing to do with leftover pizza dough it's way simpler something my dad used to do when i was growing up just lay out the dough as before and cut it into little rectangles specific dimensions are up to you just remember they're probably double in size when you cut them pull them away from each other so they don't merge back into each other like that and you don't have to do rectangles let's try rolling some into balls again i'll let those proof for 20 or 30 minutes nice and puffy now okay wide pan and in goes at most a half inch of olive oil a centimeter and heat it to medium at most these need really gentle frying not that gentle i want to see some fizzing when it goes in plop them all down flip when the first side is just golden and really the trick here is to not burn them see that one that's too dark that'll taste burnt really gentle heat if you can turn them up on their sides and fry the sides go for it but i kind of like the pale sides heterogeneity and when they're golden and they don't seem to be puffing up anymore i'd basically cook them another minute just to make sure the inside is done and pull them out to paper towels you could sprinkle some salt on them right now while they're still sticky but my dough is already pretty well seasoned give one of those a taste those were dinner rolls in my house growing up they taste strongly of the extra virgin olive oil which is delicious a little crispy little chewy always looked forward to those when i was a kid and here's another thing my dad would do in with the little spherical ones they're not donut holes don't bother trying to get even color on them all the way around some paper towels into a bowl this time and you can see i let a couple of those get too dark while i was moving the camera then cinnamon sugar it's usually about five parts sugar to one part cinnamon dump on a lot of it it's the only source of sugar in this dessert shake those up a little bit my dad used to do this in a paper lunch bag to wick away oil and if you think olive oil has no place in desserts think again my friend that is a phenomenal flavor combination way more sophisticated than a donut and not too sweet okay third thing to do with leftover pizza dough make pizza bread i have a whole video about this in the description but it's just a cute name my kids gave to this very simple thing works best with a dough that you've aged in the fridge for like a week you take your dough out and turn it around the underside has a rougher more bubbly surface you wipe it down with some olive oil and you put on whatever seasonings you want i do black pepper garlic powder and some very big crunchy salt my oven has been preheating on maximum for about a half hour and i'll just plop this down onto my pizza steel a stone works too i wouldn't try to shimmy this on with a peel the olive oil would make it stick i just drop it on that takes seven minutes if the top is not browning you might need to turn on the broiler midway that's just the heat from above the grill don't burn the garlic powder though it burns easy i often need a metal tool to scrape that up off the steel look at the bottom if you just try to bake this on a baking sheet or something you won't get that crispy base and if you've seen me bake this bread before you might be thinking hey that looks a little different on top yes it does because i got a new oven and it's just amazing the extent to which every oven is different look at that glassy crispy top on that just a shockingly good simple thing that never fails to please the kids or adults fourth thing you can do with leftover dough freeze it pizza dough freezes amazingly well just freeze it after it is fully risen when it's ready to bake i could just transfer that glass container straight to the freezer the dough is full of air so it's not like straight water that expands when it freezes and breaks glass containers but this does work better if you pull it out and wrap it in plastic wrap or put it in a freezer bag if the dough is spread out nice and flat it will freeze quickly and it will thaw quickly it's flat and it's full of air bubbles so it'll thaw on the counter in like 30 or 40 minutes 20 minutes if you put it on aluminum which is extremely thermally conductive just flip it halfway when you can feel that side touching the metal is soft 20 minutes later it's ready now has freezing killed the yeast in there some of them probably and that might be a problem if we were making a bread that needs to proof up really big and puffy right before baking but with a flat bread like pizza every single yeast could be dead in there and it wouldn't matter as long as we let the dough rise before we freeze it and what kind of pizza are we making now well this is idea number five use your leftover dough to experiment with something new in this case lauren's been wanting to try this smitten kitchen recipe she saw for a summer squash pizza it's linked in the description if you go through all the work to make dough and you let it ferment possibly for days you're going to be really bummed if you try some weird new pizza that you've never made before and it sucks so i say do all your experimenting with your extra dough especially when you're not particularly hungry then you can't lose this is just a couple of grated squash into which she's put like a teaspoon of salt to witness the power of osmosis just squeeze all the moisture she can out of that and discard then mix in like four or five ounces of gruyere maybe 120 grams we both thought this recipe looked promising but we were worried the flavors would be a little bland it does call for gruyere which is certainly stronger than mozzarella so we're thinking that might compensate for the lack of any strong sauce we had an instinct to use garlic but we figured we'd follow the recipe which also calls for scattering some bread crumbs on the top before baking we're using panko this should brown and make a nice textural contrast my pizza steel has been preheating on max temperature for like an hour and i turned on the broiler halfway through to brown the top looks pretty nice that by the way can you tell this dough was frozen neither can i it's still puffed up great around the rim nice and crispy nice brown bottom that smitten kitchen recipe really is delicious though we do both think it needs garlic and we're not mad because we're just experimenting with our extra doughs we already had normal pizza last night we can't lose and you can't lose if you pre-order lauren's latest novel it's kind of a cheesy love story link in the description hashtag kind of an ad because we're married but lauren's not the sponsor of this video houses and their farm-to-glass aperitifs are just as good with dinner as they are before dinner get free shipping and 10 off with my link and code in the description along with my dough recipe

Use my code, ADAMRAGUSEA → http://bit.ly/nativeadamragusea...",29:02.6, so many hours of my life i have spent watching these videos from bakeries in taiwan and singapore and malaysia and such where these people cut these cakes the size of toddler beds and when the knife goes in the cake kind of goes it is transfixing i had to have one and the only way that was going to happen is if i baked it myself so here's my recipe it's really just a simple sponge cake called castella portuguese traders introduced it to japan in the 16th century as near as i can tell the more popular version in japan these days has cheese in it this does not this version seems to be more associated with taiwan it's just a simple egg sponge baked on the scale of a toddler bed the first thing you'll need is a cake pan and then you'll need a bigger one because we're going to bake this thing in a water bath that right there could work but the cake would not go wubba wubba very much when you cut it too much rigid surface relative to its pudding like inner mass the pan's just too small too short especially i want to bake in this tall sided pan that i've got those walls are three inches almost eight centimeters so what can i put this inside my big roasting tray where i do my thanksgiving turkey just barely fits use whatever pans you've got you could probably use those big disposable aluminum ones if you wanted i worked out a simple formula for calibrating the recipe to any pan's dimensions it's in the description math is your friend now i'm going to pour some water in here doesn't have to be hot yet we're just testing to see how much the inner pan is going to displace it looks to me like those jiggly cake bakeries in taiwan and such use steam injection ovens best way to simulate that at home is by baking in a water bath you'll see what it does the inner pan is floating i'll push it down a little bit but honestly it'll probably still float with the batter in it this cake is mostly air the water does not have to come all the way up the sides now the inner pan can come out and i'll load that into the oven rather than trying to pour hot water into the oven later we can just let that heat up with the oven i baked a dozen of these damn cakes in a weekend and found 325 fahrenheit to be the winning temperature in my oven that's 160c and i'm not using my convection fan i find the fan makes the top of the cake crack now you're going to need a huge bowl and another huge bowl time for the batter and when i studied all the castella recipes i could find it became obvious that the varying ingredient quantities i observed all kind of orbit around the same simple whole number proportions i think this must have been the mother recipe it's by weight four parts eggs to one part fat one part milk one part flour and one part sugar i'm not saying all the recipes do that but they all seem to be doing slight variations of that and i think it's a great place to start my pan is 432 square inches so according to my little formula we're going to need 20 eggs yes 20. the mass of this cake is literally half egg and we need to separate the white from the yolk i normally do that by passing the yolk between the two sides of the shell but in every one of these jiggly cake videos from the bakeries i see people unloading all the eggs whole into a big bowl and then going in with their hands to separate out the yolks you can just kind of pass it between your hands and eventually the white will slither out between your fingers put the yolk into the other giant bowl this works but here's the catch if you rupture one and i need just one of these yolks and some of the yellow leaks down into the bowl with all the whites you will have just wasted all of these eggs we need to beat the whites and their proteins won't foam up if there's any fat in the bowl the yolk has a ton of fat i do not understand why the manager of a castella bakery would trust their employees with this procedure i would totally have them separate the eggs one at a time in a separate bowl keeping each white quarantined until it's clean god burst one get it away get it away i'm sweating luckily that's not a problem thanks to the sponsor of this video native deodorant whom i'll now briefly thank it sounds kind of funny but if a chef were to make deodorant i'm pretty sure native is what they'd come up with look at these scents coconut and vanilla herbal citrus cucumber mint that one's my favorite for sure i love cucumber in just about anything my wife has been on me about switching to an aluminum free deodorant for a long time aluminum salts plug up your pores that's how they work but that has caused me some problems that i won't describe in detail in a food video woe is me the shilling in the armpit that's a little joke for you history buffs anyway lauren's used native for years the scents are super classy they sort of remind me of cocktails in a good way especially that citrus one tons of scents to choose from and they last all day long even in a hot kitchen they're also vegan and cruelty free three deodorants are normally 36 dollars but if you use my link and code in the description you'll get them for 24. that's 33 off link and code in the description thank you native now we've got 20 eggs separated if we look at our mother proportions we can calculate how much we need of everything else a typical large chicken egg minus its shell weighs about 50 grams 50 times 20 eggs is a kilo a thousand grams of eggs all the other ingredients should weigh one quarter of that right so we need 250 grams of fat in the yolks some people apparently use melted butter that'd have nice flavor but vegetable oil will get you a softer texture and i think this cake is entirely about the texture oil is what i see the pros using in the videos time for the milk 250 grams of milk now for 250 of flour all-purpose flour would probably be fine but most people seem to use cake flour and i think that makes sense cakes built on egg foams can sometimes be a little tough so it makes sense to use a softer flour now there are some small additions that are not covered by the macro formula a lot of recipes call for a little cornstarch and i think it's good it makes the interior crumb of the cake finer more pudding like i'd use like a tenth of the weight of your flour so i put in 25 grams a giant glug of vanilla though the easiest way to play with different flavors here would be to put in different extracts maybe do some orange extract plus some orange food coloring whatever and then salt i would do like a heaped teaspoon for this much that apparently works out to half a gram of salt per egg if you want to know last thing we need to measure is our sugar into a separate bowl and this is where i deviate from the mother formula a bit i've gotten a glossier top on the cake when i use a little more than one part sugar what is that 270 grams okay i lied one more thing to measure a little cream of tartar into the egg whites acids make egg foams more elastic and thus more able to mix with other ingredients without deflating some people say it's a quarter teaspoon for every four egg whites some people say it's twice that i don't think you need to be exact and you don't have to use cream of tartar a lot of people use a little lemon juice or white vinegar instead then we'll just beat this up into a foam not in a million years would i make this cake without some kind of electric mixer took about five minutes to get it that fluffy we don't have stiff peaks or anything yet that's fine we're not done yet in goes like half the sugar and we'll beat this until it goes noticeably firmer and glossier some people mix the sugar in with the whites from the start but that can keep your foam from ever forming it's safer to mix in the sugar gradually at the end the sugar will significantly strengthen the foam at this stage make it way firmer you can see how i've got like medium peaks now peaks that flop over when i've taken it all the way to stiff peaks with the sugar in it i've gotten cakes that puff up more in the oven but the top cracks more if that matters to you now we just go right into the other ingredients just blast it with the mixer until it's really smooth some people apparently sift all their dry ingredients into the bowl i see no point the mixer is going to smooth everything out don't worry you're not going to develop the gluten and make the cake tough we're using cake flour and there's hardly even any of it in there the structural matrix of this cake is egg not wheat now i'm just going to start stirring in my meringue it's easier if you do it in a couple installments you might have it in your head that you need to gently fold in the egg foam lest you deflate it but you'd never be able to get a homogeneous mixture here through folding there's just too much meringue it's more meringue now than cake twisted and evil i'm just mixing that until i don't see any streaks of yellow anymore i've seen people in the taiwanese bakery straight up whip these together in a stand mixer and their cakes still come out like pillows only reason i'm using a spatula is because i'd have to totally submerge my hand mixer to keep using it in here all right time for the pan and you've gotta line your pan with parchment paper sponge cakes are both sticky and delicate a deadly combination when it comes to extracting something from a pan how you line yours will depend on the dimensions of your cake and your roll of parchment but i've got a couple of little strips for the two sides and one big one down the middle with enough excess on either side that i can use it as a sling later to lift the cake out don't worry if things are collapsing or not lying flat the weight of the batter will hold everything down this batter came out particularly thin i think that has more to do with how stiff i beat the meringue as opposed to any of the other ingredient proportions but i definitely find i get a smoother more attractive top with a thinner batter there look i didn't even have to smooth that out with a spatula in this goes to the water bath and you'll probably have to just drop the pan in which will result in a little splash but that's fine an initial burst of steam in the oven will probably be good for the cake you bake a cake in a water bath for two reasons one is to create a steam environment in there that will keep the top from setting up hard and restricting the upward expansion of the cake the other reason for the water bath is to keep the sides of the cake from overcooking water can get no hotter than its boiling point and 212 fahrenheit or 100c is well below the temperature needed to brown anything the water will keep the sides of the cake pan relatively cool a smaller castella might need an hour this needed an hour and a half before it looked ready to test by poking it with a skewer nope still too wet on the inside look at the crumbs clinging to the skewer if you're afraid your top is going to burn before the inside is done you can always just turn the heat down or turn it up if the top isn't browning fast enough like 10 minutes later there we are skewer comes out clean time to lift this out and i see no reason to unload a giant pan of hot water right now i'd say just turn off the oven and come back for it when it's cool in the bakery videos they turn the cakes out by inverting them onto a big cutting board but ours is only the size of a couch cushion not a toddler bed so we can simply grab the ends of the big parchment piece and sling the cake out without folding it over on itself and breaking it or anything we can pull all the paper off now note how light the sides are if we didn't bake it in the water bath they'd be very brown come on man look at that it just looks like the airplane seat that you can use as a flotation device in the unlikely event of a water landing look at it jiggle time for the big moment and you'll want the longest knife you have they have these crazy long ones at the bakeries that whoops right there that's what happens when you don't have a long enough knife so obviously it looks awesome and it feels awesome but does it taste awesome honestly when you eat it while it's still very warm i think it kind of tastes like farts remember it's half egg and eggs have sulfur in them that taste really does go away though as the cake cools i don't know if it's the sulfur off-gassing or breaking down or what but the cooled cake does taste nice i do think this is mostly about the novelty value of making something so springy and pillowy how much of it is air well i can show you precisely how much those hydraulic press videos are my second favorite sub-genre of oddly satisfying youtube videos the first of course being jiggly cake cutting you can make this taste more interesting by putting in different flavorings or some chunks like chocolate chips people do that maybe we'll try that another time but for now let's just revel in this simple pleasure wubba wubba wubba

Thanks to Rocking Chair Ranch in Georgia...",29:02.6, so you can cook an expensive tender beef cut like rib eye excellent this is about how to cook some not so tender cuts steaks with a lot more flavor but they require some slightly more specialized knife work to make them easily edible knife work either before cooking after cooking or both we're going to talk about the hanger steak the short rib yes short rib can be a steak and this one the skirt steak it's so small or is it bottom bottom this is parody so it is fair use this is the outside skirt steak there's an inside skirt steak and an outside skirt steak both are cuts from around the belly of the animal but the outside one is way better in my opinion it's much more tender first thing i'm going to do is cut it into shorter pieces pieces as wide as my pan this also allows me to divide the meat into pieces of like thickness that thin one on the right is going to cook in literally seconds the thick one on the left will take like five minutes or so and now we're free to cook each segment for exactly the time that it needs the first thing you'll notice is the very prominent and coarse grain of the meat the meat fibers running side to side most of these more esoteric steak cuts are not steaks in the narrow definition of the term remember the narrow definition is a single serving cut of meat cut against the grain so that it has short meat fibers running up and down instead of long ones running side to side the tender cuts from the animal's back are from huge muscles that are thick enough to be cut against the grain these cuts from the belly are much thinner muscles and therefore simply cannot be cut into stakes against the grain thus necessitating some more specialized treatment from us the cook the grain structure also makes these cuts very good at absorbing a marinade probably because of the extra surface area those ridges offer i marinate flank steak which is a similar cut from the belly but i never marinate a nice outside skirt steak i see no point it has such beautiful strong flavor all by itself thanks to that fat that's what the flank steak doesn't have look at all the fat on the skirt i wouldn't dream of trimming that off i'm simply going to cook it to the point where most of that fat has gone deliciously melty sometimes you'll get skirt steak with this very tough membrane or sheet of connective tissue still attached you'll know it when you see it and it has to be trimmed off but this on the flip side this is not that this is an inconsequentially thin membrane that does not need to be trimmed don't bother you'll know the one that needs to be trimmed when you see it it's like a rubber band coating the meat this meat needs no trimming at all it just needs some pepper and salt go easy on the salt because it's extremely thin meat and go easy on the oil it's plenty fatty as it is i'm using my cast iron pan and i've got it quite hot remember the counterintuitive law of steak cookery the thicker the steak is the lower the temperature you have to use and vice versa with an extremely thin steak like this you need very intense heat if you want any chance of getting a golden crust on the outside before the inside is overcooked i'm putting the thicker longer cooking pieces in first and along the edge of the pan where it's a lot less hot i'm putting that thin little scooby snack right in the super hot center and if things don't quite fit yet don't worry they will soon see i'm doing constant flipping flipping every 30 seconds or so i'm 100 sold on that newfangled technique you can see the crust gradually build though i can already see some pink juice pushing out of the paper thin piece in the middle so that really needs to come out remember carryover cooking the phenomenon where heat from the outside of the meat continues to move into the interior during resting that effect is much more pronounced on a very thin piece of meat so you gotta pull a cut like this when it's probably still quite raw on the inside it won't be raw after it rests that said i like to cook outside skirt steak to medium or maybe even medium well it's tender enough that it can take it unlike inside skirt steak and with really fatty cuts it pays to give the fat more time to render and melt the fat will supply the moisture that you lose by cooking the steak to a greater doneness the thickest cut is of course taking the longest i'm looking to see plenty of pink juice pushing up by the way you need intense heat for a thin cut but i'm still not on high heat here i'm on medium high because i have a crazy powerful electric stovetop you want to see what high heat on my stove does to steaks that just tastes like a lump of coal don't believe the chefs who say you gotta crank your stove as high as it'll go every oven is different gas stoves are often less powerful and it simply takes experience to learn what setting on your stove will get you a golden brown but not burned crust okay i'll let these rest for a few minutes and then i'm going to cut them all in half with the grain because the next thing i'm going to do is slice them very thin against the grain and the resulting shorter slices will be perfect bite-sized pieces this is the crucial step you have to cut a steak like this across the meat fibers if you don't it'll be inedibly chewy but if you do cut against the grain look at that these short little meat fibers just pull apart almost effortlessly that has such strong beef flavor i think it needs no marinade or any extra flavoring though if you want one a common choice would be chimichurri basically south american pesto you peel a couple of garlic cloves not too many because the garlic is going to be raw and raw garlic is orders of magnitude stronger than cooked garlic then a big pile of fresh herbs most uruguayan and argentinian recipes i've seen call for parsley and oregano i hate fresh oregano so i use parsley and cilantro instead but you can use whatever you want then just chop all that up as fine as you can get it some people do this in the food processor but in order for that to work you'd have to put in the olive oil and olive oil tends to go bitter in food processors for science reasons it's easy enough to hack this up by hand and a lot of people would include a fresh red chili in there i only have dried today but that's fine pinch of salt a little pepper and then just enough nice olive oil to turn this into a sauce then a touch of acid i think red wine vinegar is the traditional thing but i use lime juice sometimes this is not a vinaigrette that would be way more vinegar chimichurri traditionally has just a splash of acid though it's your food and you can make it taste however you want i think i put a little too much salt in there so i'm going to dilute with a little more oil right now that just tastes like all those ingredients chopped up and combined but after it sits for a few hours or overnight the flavors really merge you can just spoon a little over your steak that's probably too much very strong stuff but very nice outside skirt steak it may be my single favorite piece of animal meat protein

muscle this is known as possibly the best cut for braising long slow wet cooking until it goes soft short ribs are heavily marbled with fat which keeps them moist during long cooking and they have a lot of connective tissue around the bone which dissolves in a braise and makes for a delicious sauce but unlike most other braising cuts it doesn't actually have much connective tissue inside the bulk of the meat itself it's shockingly tender especially if you get the biggest meatiest english cut short ribs you can find which will generally be from the ribs extending down from the chuck section or from the rib section those are the ribs that come down from the rib roast or the ribeye steak so of course that meat is tender you just have to butterfly it to make it into a wide flat steak i'll show you two methods first look at the bone it'll usually be a little bit off center and i really prefer to start cutting on the side of the bone that is closer to the edge just cut down along the bone as close to the bone as you can get then stop before you go all the way through open up the meat like a book that flap of meat that was thicker on this side of the bone makes a better hinge to open this up then i'm going to cut this thicker side of the book into half its current thickness again stopping right before i go all the way through then opening it up you can make a few more little shallow slices to make it lay as flat as possible that's one way to do this another way to do it is what's called accordion cutting you cut down along the bone as before then rather than opening it up you just simply flip the meat around and make another cut straight down but not all the way through then you can unfurl the meat like the bellows of an accordion that might be a little easier if you're doing three or four cuts to make super thin korean style short ribs for example but i think either way is just as easy for doing the two cuts it takes to turn a short rib into a nice thick steak salt pepper and oil and since it's a nice thick steak it counter-intuitively needs less heat i'm just on medium heat here again flipping every 30 seconds but after my first flip i'm going to apply my culinary brick otherwise known as a brick wrapped in aluminum foil for hygiene hygiene is also why i waited until that first side had a little sear on it before i put the brick on that way the brick is not touching raw meat right now it's touching a sterilized surface so it won't now cross contaminate the other side when i flip and i'll keep flipping every 30 seconds the brick isn't necessary but a butterfly cut like this might not really lie flat against the pan surface it'll sort of tent up around the hinges the brick helps you get even contact and thorough crust formation along the entire area of the meat and just like with the skirt steak i'm shooting for medium here rather than medium rare to give all that fat in there more of a chance to melt so rather than looking to see the first little bits of pink juice surfacing i'm looking to see lots of pink juice coming up and pooling on the meat that usually happens at medium out this comes let it rest and then i'll slice this thin it's tender but it's not super tender so thin slicing helps and you can try to slice it against the grain but the butterflying tends to give you a steak where the grain is running in multiple crazy directions so just do the best you can a little finishing salt maybe that's smoked sea salt shockingly good steak the fat in this cut has a slightly gamey flavor that really reminds me of lamb especially when you gnaw on all that delicious stuff around that bone now the beef cuts we've been talking about are often known as butcher's cuts little odd scraps that butchers historically kept for themselves because only they knew how to deal with them and only they knew how good they are the third and final cut we'll discuss is kind of the archetypal butcher's cut the hanger steak sometimes simply called butcher's steak this is the favorite steak cut of joseph egloff the rancher whose cows i am cooking today he raises grass-fed beef here at rocking chair ranch in monroe county georgia just north of where i live in macon rain or shine the hanger i think has extremely beefy taste it comes from just above the diaphragm of the animal above the brisket on the top side that's why they call it the hanger it kind of hangs down from the diaphragm and there is only one on every animal so it can be hard to find certainly a key to excellent steak cookery is to find a butcher or a rancher whom you know and whose work you trust and i trust joseph he butchers his animals on site so he knows exactly what he's giving me the smaller hanger here is from a somewhat younger animal it would be a little bit more tender but i'm going to cook this bigger one from an older animal it'll have beefier flavor i just thought it in a bowl of cool tap water it took 40 minutes in there and here it is this is going to take some more advanced home butchery to prep first thing to do is trim off the silver skin that's this rubber band like connective tissue here you can clearly see and feel how it's different from fat it will not melt during cooking it's got to come off and you can do that with any sharp knife but if you have a really thin knife like this that's probably better this is from a little company in ohio called warther knives made from a stamped blade rather than a forged blade are generally really thin and they'll help you slip under that silver skin and shave it off while removing as little of the meat as possible i'm no blade master i find it often helps to get a strip of silver skin started and then pull up on it and then you shave through the rest that's a pretty foolproof approach if inelegant what i don't want to do is trim off any of the fat if i can avoid it the fat is delicious i'm just trimming silver skin there we go there is a remaining band of connective tissue and it is running straight down through the middle of this meat it is one of the chewiest animal pieces you will ever encounter you could simply cook this thing whole let it rest then carve it down the middle and shave off that tissue before slicing up both sides i prefer to take it out now so that i can cook both sides of this individually they benefit from separate treatment because as you'll notice they're not the same size that's not an anatomical aberration this is a standard asymmetry on the animal one side of the hanger is way bigger than the other so i'm going to separate them by slowly unzipping the meat along the seam of that connective tissue i don't want to waste any of this precious meat i'm cutting right along the white part until i've got the have separated that bigger piece is now totally clean i just have to peel the connective tissue from this smaller half kind of looks like a strip of bacon alrighty pretty minimal trimming waste there i'm pleased with myself okay now i've got these pieces that kind of look like little tenderloins and in fact the smaller one i'm just going to cut in half and i'm going to pan roast them like loins cutting in half again helps them fit in my pan and gets me two pieces of more consistent thickness the thinner half will require less cooking time this bigger side you could certainly roast or grill whole as well but i'm going to butterfly it into four thin steaks first up is this part that kind of hangs off to the side i've seen people basically discard that as trimming that's crazy take it off cut it to half its original thickness and stop right before you go all the way through open her up and that is a perfectly lovely little steak right there i can get some bigger ones out of this i'll cut this into three trying to get three pieces of roughly equal mass bearing in mind the middle part there is much thicker again just slide the knife in there and cut it to half its thickness open it up and give it a few shallow cuts to get it to lay nice and flat then some people go the further step of scoring this against the grain to give it a little more surface area maybe tenderize it a little bit i don't think that really does very much this technique of butterflying chunks of hanger into individual thin steaks is something i really associate with french bistros the french call hanger anglais and it's one of the classic cuts for steak freeze french bistro steak and fries i've seen them cut even thinner in that context with like three cuts like this three flaps each a third of the steak's original thickness i find that pretty tricky to do but maybe you're better with a knife there you go there may be only one hanger on the animal but it's not just one steak it's like four to six portions lordy look at how beautiful that meat is a little salt pepper and oil on one of those little bistro steaks by the way one of the reasons i'm kind of loving my cast iron pan again is that the temperature is just about perfect for steak when you see the residual oil on it just starting to smoke that's a great rough indicator flipping every 30 seconds watch that crust slowly build flipping often instead of once gets you more even cooking and it's easier there's no surprises if your heat is too high or too low you're going to see immediately if there's a little burning going on you'll see it and you can turn the heat down before it's too late with these coarse grained steaks i find the visual trick of just looking for pink juice to be particularly effective it's really easy to see as it pools in those grooves when i see a good amount of juice surfacing i know this is medium rare going on medium let it rest a little bit and people say that hanger steak has the beefy flavor of skirt with all the tenderness of tenderloin that's crazy talk it's tender but it's not as tender as tenderloin you still need to slice it thin against the grain and i'm doing it with my knife at a shallow angle on the bias as they say that gets you prettier wider slices instead of thin little strips i cannot describe how delicious that is it is so worth the extra butchery work quite tender if the muscle fibers are short and the wide open grain structure would be particularly good at holding onto a nice pan sauce so let's talk about sauce i think there are two reasons pan sauces aren't nearly as popular for steak as they are for pork and chicken the first is simply that good beef has a strong flavor and just doesn't need sauce as much as chicken breast does but the other reason is that in order to get a nice sear on a thin steak you generally have to burn the fond in the pan like that's burned i don't want to dissolve that into a sauce it would taste bad but let's consider these loin-like pieces that we cut these are a lot thicker and the thicker the steak the lower the heat you generally want to use so we can cook these more gently and incidentally not burn our fond in the process this is like medium low heat on my stove i'm just rolling them around frequently until i've got a decent crust built up on the outside then i'll just start butter basting you can do that with a spoon but i find it works just as well to simply keep flipping the meat around in the butter this creates something like a roasting environment in the pan omnidirectional heat that will help you cook something thicker like this through since this is like a little roast more than a steak i might use a thermometer to judge doneness but you can also just poke and peek and if you're going to do that scissors are great snipping it is way easier than trying to saw through something with a knife while it's still in the pan yeah still quite raw in the center but one of the flaws of poke and peak is that you're looking at the meat pre-carry-over cooking remember that the inside will keep cooking as you let it rest on the board i see a lot of pink juice pushing out of the side on that big one i'll bet that thinner piece is done by now i'll just give a thicker piece another minute or so i love cutting meat into smaller pieces of relatively uniform size for precisely this reason now while those rest some shallots i chopped these up earlier nice and fine i think shallots are the classic allium for pan sauces in part because the layers are thin so the pieces are small and they cook really quickly pan sauce has to be quick or your meat will go cold when those are brown and soft i'll deglaze with a little red wine i'm using a wooden spoon so i can scrape the pan without chipping my seasoning layer if you don't want to use wine i'd suggest water followed by a big splash of balsamic vinegar and if you're a lucky duck like me and you have a couple of ice cubes of homemade demi-glace in the freezer now is a great time to use them i have a whole video about this stuff in the description i use a modified version of chef john's method which uses beef plus chicken wings to simulate the traditional and much more expensive veal joints if your sauce starts to look over reduced like this does consider adding water instead of more wine too much reduced red wine can get pretty bitter now i'll simply turn off the heat and when the bubbling has all but stopped i'll stir in some butter if i didn't have the demi-glass in there i'd probably compensate by using like twice this much butter you mix the butter into a sauce off the boil and a thick luscious emulsion will form if the sauce is really boiling the butter will just separate into water with oil on top off the heat while we carve our little mock tenderloins into thin medallions look how pretty that is i'll pour the juices from my board into the sauce god man overboard well i guess i'll just have to eat that one i might tear some parsley into this at the last second there's enough heat in there to wilt it down but without turning it brown and then we can spoon that right over again that coarse grain structure of the hanger gives you all these little ridges in the meat where the sauce can flow absolutely delicious i hope i've given you some courage to graduate to these slightly more challenging cuts they're not always cheaper thanks to jerks like me popularizing them but they are so much more flavorful than the big tender cuts give one a try and see for yourself

squarespace it's been called the greatest regional american dessert key lime pie is a custard pie from florida it was originally not baked at all but we're gonna bake this one it's my wife's favorite dessert and she asked me to make her one so we're making it i'm on team graham cracker crust all day long some people do make this with a pastry crust but i've got about 200 grams of graham crackers here which is the most you'd possibly need for a 9 inch or 23 centimeter pie pan and you could just crunch them up with your hands that'd take a while and you'd get a very heterogeneous product which a lot of people prefer and a quicker way to do that is by putting the crackers in a bag and just beating them with something heavy me this is a rare occasion where i prefer homogeneity i'm using the food processor to get a totally even sandy crumb i like how this sets up really solid in the finished pie a few pieces inevitably just spin around because food processors i don't know just eat those this is not an exact science yes i'm going to mix this crust right in my pie pan i see no reason to dirty another vessel butter i'm using salted because it's usually what i have in the house and because i love salt in a graham cracker crust so good if you're using unsalted butter i would suggest up to half a teaspoon of salt to match this whole stick four ounces 114 grams of butter into the microwave to melt on low power full power would cause the water inside to explode and make a mess in there while we're waiting sugar you could use any form of sugar but for this i like dark brown sugar or some white sugar followed by a healthy glug of molasses because that's all brown sugar is i've started with like a third of a cup of sugar i might add more and i absolutely love a little cinnamon in key lime pie crust i've had it this way in the florida keys many times oh for people who don't know the keys are a chain of coral islands off the coast of south florida my folks used to live down there anyway maybe half a teaspoon of cinnamon to start with here's our butter safely melted if you want to keep your pie vegan use coconut oil i'm going to start with only about two thirds of that maybe it'll need the rest maybe it won't absolutely no point in mixing this up with a spoon you're going to need your hands eventually to mold this crust into the pan so just toss it around and when it looks like wet sand like that you could call it done that'd get you a very crumbly crust which a lot of people like i'm going to put in the rest of my melted butter when it's moist enough that you can kind of mold it like clay the finished crust will have a solid texture like a cookie which is usually what i prefer and there's no reason at all for you to take my word on the flavors with something like this just have a taste and adjust i think i'll need more sugar to balance the acidity of the custard and i'll do a little more cinnamon just toss that together and you start molding it into the pie pan this isn't rocket science but one thing to be careful of is that the crust in the corner tends to be way too thick like you can't even push your fork through it so i'm just going around with my fingers and pinching the crust into that corner to get it thinner in there you'd call that done but a lot of people take a glass or a measuring cup or something and just press it into the crumb this is about getting it to uniform thickness sure but it's also about compressing the crumb to help it hold together some people go around the edge with the glass too but i always feel like my fingers do a better job you'd need an object with the exact same angle as the rim of the pan there you go that's it easy as well you know my oven is on 325 fahrenheit convection 160c if you don't have convection i do 350 fahrenheit 180c and we're just going to blind bake the crust for maybe 10 minutes just bake it empty if we didn't do this the crust wouldn't be nearly as solid or as toasty at the end out it comes don't worry if you see some butter pooling it'll get reabsorbed while that cools down we can make our filling time for the key limes the key limes okay so i don't have any but you probably don't either key limes are delicious my dad used to grow them they're these very small yellow limes that have a distinct herbal or aromatic note but they're not that widely available unless you buy the juice a lot of people use this nelly and joe's if you taste it it has that distinct key lime flavor but it also just tastes like old juice from concentrate which is exactly what it is i'd rather use fresh juice from a persian lime i want some zest too and it's always way easier to scrape off the zest before you juice the fruit i'm just running it down my microplane grater giving it a slight rotation in my hand running it down again is that enough no i think i want one more a lot of people don't use the zest at all in this i think it tastes great it's got more lime flavor than the actual lime time to cut these in half and juice them juice yours however you want but i think reamers are incredibly convenient simple tools i'm looking for at most a cup of juice 235 mils i ended up needing eight limes for that limes are incredibly variable in their juice content so always buy extra there we go it's time to separate some eggs we'll want five or six egg yolks i'm just catching the whites in a little bowl so that i can use them for something some people actually replace the eggs in this pie with sour cream i'm not a fan i think that gets you something to taste more like a dip than a pie filling but if you use like half a cup of vegan sour cream that would be a great option for a vegan pie all right i've got five there lots of folks would use those whites to make a meringue topping for the pie very synergistic but lauren likes whipped cream on hers instead of meringue so i will simply save these for an egg white omelet to counteract the pie in my diet also synergistic now the next thing sweetened condensed milk this is absolutely traditional in fact the historical origin of pies like this might be from recipes promoted by the condensed milk industry you'd normally make a custard with cream but condensed milk has a much stronger milky flavor that you can actually taste in the presence of all that lime juice cream would just get lost i'm using two of these 14 ounce cans that's 8 30 mls three and a half cups vegans there's a note in the description about how to make this with coconut milk i'll whisk those two things together before i whisk in the lime juice it's easier to break up the yolks when they're not sloshing around in a watery mixture and getting the sugar mixed into them makes it less likely that the egg proteins will be curdled by all this acid that said early recipes for this pie were so-called icebox pies pies that never go in the oven they used to rely on the acid from the lime to chemically cook the eggs there's some risk of foodborne illness there which is probably why people eventually started baking this pie i only put in like three quarters of a cup of my lime juice and i'm tasting it yes eating a small amount of raw custard presents some small risk of foodborne illness but i'm a big boy and living is choices if you don't like your pie very acidic i'd stop there do the full cup only if you like it very limey that's nice here's my zest from like three of the eight limes i juiced you don't have to put this in but i think it adds a lot of lime flavor as opposed to just lime acidity my crust is mostly cooled down now which is important if it was too hot the bottom layer of custard would get overcooked it should look like you don't have quite enough because custards puff up a little bit in the oven you don't want things overflowing you can thump that a little bit to make any large air bubbles come to the surface and pop but be gentle with a ceramic pie pan back in the oven this goes same temp as before here it is after 10 minutes and i'm going to assess its doneness by just kind of shoving the pie pan see how wobbly it is we're looking for it to firm up some more here it is after 20 minutes still wobbly but you can see it's cooking on the inside here it is after 30 minutes and you probably don't want it any firmer than that that's the longest i would bake this if you bake it until it has no bounce at all it'll have a curdled texture not a creamy smooth one look at that beautiful we got to let this cool down on the counter for like an hour or two and then you have to chill it in the fridge overnight you probably want to cover that but plastic wrap would stick to the surface and mess it up so i'm doming this with an upside down plate not an airtight seal but it should reduce air circulation enough to keep the pie from drying out or picking up fridge flavors good night the next day i'll whip the cream i'm just doing a cup 235 mils you might want twice that depending on how much whipped cream you like on your pie this is easy as you know what with an electric hand mixer 90 seconds later i've got whipped cream mix in as much sugar as you want for your taste though powdered sugar is best for whipped cream that you want to hold on to for a day or two the corn starch and it absorbs water that gradually weeps out of the cream and a little vanilla be careful too much will make the color go very brown there we go after a long chill we can finally have pie and as any pie maker knows the vanguard slice is the forlorn hope there's no way it's coming out pretty so that's my piece now that you got some room in there to work you can get out a nice pretty slice but i'm not gonna lie it's a delicate pie it's tricky to get out clean that's why some people use a springform pan for this they also sometimes cover the whole surface with whipped cream before slicing i prefer a dollop on top so that you can dose out the cream at will you can grate a little more zest on top that's nice because the zest inside usually turns brown and this is the kind of inedible nonsense that i'm purely doing for the thumbnail there you go nice creamy soft custard because we pulled it while it was still a little wobbly the crust basically tastes like a giant golden graham and it's got that chewy cookie-like texture because we used a lot of butter lauren is

ribs or kalbi it's simply one of the great classic beef dishes of the world and if you want a super authentic recipe go try someone who can pronounce colby this recipe is how i was able to get as close as possible to the korean-american restaurant style dish that i know and love in my home kitchen with stuff from my grocery store and here's the two forms in which short ribs are generally sold in mainstream u.s grocery stores these are english cut one long bone with a big block of meat hanging to one side sometimes i'll see them sold twice as long like those two connected that would not work for korean short ribs but these english cut ones absolutely will the other form in which i commonly can get these is known as flankin cut instead of one long rib bone by itself it's a chain of short rib bones all connected with meat if i drove up to atlanta and went to a korean market i could get something that was like this but about half as thick that would be los angeles style colby really the more traditional thing among korean americans but i have to make do with this and i'll show you a way to adapt to their thickness look at all that delicious fat marbled through both of these cuts don't trim too much of it off that fat is a lot of what people like about short ribs one thing though the sheer amount of cut bone surface on a flank and short rib makes it really likely you'll encounter some bone dust or shards on there that's never bothered me but a lot of people wash these to get rid of that they also wash these to quote unquote draw out the blood and yes there is blood in here not the meat juice that people always mistake for blood but actual red blood cells inside those bones and you will see it come out during cooking most korean recipes i've seen call for washing the bone dust off in a bowl of water and then letting these soak in there for at least a half hour frankly i really doubt that's going to do much to address the blood situation but hey let's try it now to prep these english cut ribs we'll have to butterfly them it's kind of tricky but here's the easiest way that i've found the bone will usually be a little off center look for the side where the bone is closer to the edge lay it down with that side on top and then cut down right along the bone as close as you can to it then stop right before you go all the way through lay it out that extra meat on the side of the bone makes a better hinge then i'm going to do this the really easy way which is just to do one more cut to make the remaining meet half its original thickness stop before you get to the edge then just open it up like a book for me that's it two cuts three flaps people often do like three or four cuts to get a much thinner ribbon of meat i've tried that i don't do it for three reasons one it's really hard and i'm not very good with a knife i don't know about you number two more cuts for more thinner flaps would get you a ribbon of meat so long that it won't fit in a domestic skillet it'd be great for the grill or for the oven but not for the pan well if it'd be too long why not just cut it in half adam well number three if you accept a thicker than traditional cut of meat you can cook twice as many portions at one time it's really hard to make enough very thin korean short ribs to feed the whole family if you're doing it inside in a pan going thick just gets you more food quicker and quick cooked short ribs are surprisingly tender even at this thickness though i might cover this with some plastic and use my meat mallet just to pound out the thicker spots the hinges between the flaps no idea if that's traditional but i found it to be effective and way easier than delicate knife work me smash lastly people often score these to create more surface area for the marinade to penetrate very shallow cuts and with something this thin you got to make sure that you do them perpendicular on the opposite side otherwise your two scoring cuts from each side might line up in the center and you'd slice the thing right in half scoring is really supported by science marinades only penetrate a few millimeters so the more surface area the better

korean style short ribs a few garlic cloves i'll just smash them to get the skins off a big thumb of ginger just roughly shave the peel off any form of onion would be fine but i'm going to garnish the finished dish with sliced green onion tops so i might as well use the white parts in my marinade and you could skip this but i think it's quite nice peel and core a pear an asian pear would be great but i'm making do with this bosque pear which is a french cultivar asian pears have more of an apple texture and some people use apple in this too you could use all kinds of fruits you can chop this up fine maybe grate it but i'm going to use the food processor everything in then for this much stuff i would guess maybe half a cup of soy sauce like 100 to 150 mls you can eyeball this whole recipe because in a minute we'll be able to taste and adjust now sugar i've got some demerara sugar you could use honey you could use brown sugar you could use white sugar maybe put in a dab of molasses with it because that's all brown sugar is i would guess like two tablespoons or something though some people like this dish way sweeter apparently some people put 7up or sierra mist soda in here a splash of rice wine vinegar and then i've seen a lot of recipes call for the precursor of that vinegar rice wine mirin you could do that but for my taste none of the traditional recipes i read are acidic enough so i'm going to skip the mirror and just go straight rice vinegar even more in there i'll grind in some pepper and obviously all the salt we need is in the soy sauce time to blitz that up and then you can give it a taste i think you're looking for it to taste good but way too strong in every respect it's just the flavoring for the meat it's not going in the dish i think it needs a little more sugar but be careful the sweeter it is the more likely the meat is to burn sugar burns i'm going to put in a little water mostly just to help this flow around the meat and coat it some recipes call for a lot more water but they usually have less pear the pear is mostly water then the final flavoring toasted sesame oil a few drops go a long way i think as long as you have soy sauce sugar and maybe a little vinegar in here you're going to be fine the recipes for this marinade differ so much i'm just synthesizing various ideas that i've read all right here's two of our water-soaked flank and short ribs and i'll put in two of the butterflied english cut ones just so you can see how both of those would come out that's probably around three pounds of meat and bone one and a half kilos enough for like four people and honestly that's probably enough marinade for twice that especially if you watered it down some more some people water it down just because they plan to leave it in the fridge for a couple of days and they don't want the meat to get too salty or too mushy from the acid i'm just doing this overnight cover it up and in the fridge the next day i'll take them out and pretty thoroughly wipe off the marinade you can even wash it off with water the flavor is locked into the outer layer of meat see my marination video for that science any remaining marinade actually on the surface is just likely to burn and indeed some people apparently like the bits of burnt sugar you can get on these if you grill them really hot which is how i first tried doing it this is my instagram i like a little char on meat but burned sugar is not a flavor that i'm into so here's a different traditional method suggested to me by a korean viewer on that instapost meet in your widest pan no oil and then pour in some water enough to come like halfway up put the heat on high and just let it boil out this is the exact same process often used for cooking bacon or duck breast super fatty meats fat melts at a much lower temperature than the heat at which meat browns and sugar burns water can heat no higher than its boiling point so by starting these in water we're giving a lot of the fat a chance to render and go deliciously melty this will also probably dissolve some connective tissue like you do when you braise short ribs there's that blood that we supposedly drew out of the bones by soaking not a problem it'll get cooked i'll just flip these one or two times as the water boils down korean short ribs are generally served at least medium and often cooked all the way through so don't worry about overcooking these they're filled with fat which is going to keep them moist on the inside i've watched korean cooks do this semi-wet method with much thinner la style short ribs but i think the method is even better suited to these much thicker cuts it gives them time to really cook and soften a bit before we have to start worrying about the sugar burning speaking of which as soon as most of the water has boiled out things will start to brown and then burn extremely fast you got to turn your heat way down and even then i can see some sugar starting to burn on the bottom of the pan and get it off let that cool for a sec and then over like medium low heat i can just gently fry these in their own rendered fat i'm flipping constantly just to make sure nothing's burning and the juices and residual marinade are concentrating to form a glaze that is coating the meat i absolutely love this hybrid method it's half braising half searing all deliciousness out these come and i have no idea if any koreans do what i'm about to do but i was trying to think of a way to make use of all that fond and the leftover marinade and also get some vegetables into this dish so in addition to those chopped shallots i'm going to throw in a huge pile of dark leafy greens as much as you can fit in because it'll wilt down a ton this is rainbow chard which is super pretty i just trimmed off the really stringy part of the stems hacked it into chunks washed it in a bowl of water lifted it out of there so the settled sand stayed at the bottom of the bowl and then dried it in my salad spinner i love these things you can totally be lazy and buy a bag of pre-washed pre-cut greens instead and once i've gotten some nice dry heat on them i'm going to put in some of my leftover marinade not all of it unless you're doing a huge pot of greens stir that constantly and you see how much that wilts down the sugar in that marinade is really going to balance the bitterness of the greens a little bit of rice that i got started before doing the meat that's jasmine but use whatever and cook it however you want i washed off the outer starch coat use displacement to measure 1.5 parts of water to one part rice i usually mix in like half a teaspoon of salt per cup of dry rice bring to a boil then cover and take the heat all the way down to warm just let it sit there until i'm ready to eat some of the chard next to it and you can put on one of these rib cuts whole or you could slice them up it's really common to cut or snip the flanking ones in between each bone i like that makes it a finger food these butterflied ones i might just slice thin like a steak in fact you can eat short rib as a medium rare steak more on that another day you can see with these korean style ones though were just barely a little pink in there it was hard for me to not cook beef medium rare but korean folks on my instagram were right this dish really is better more thoroughly cooked on go some ribs followed by a common garnish toasted sesame seeds you can buy them pre-toasted but the flavor is more intense if you toast them yourself dry pan moderate heat just swish them around until they start to turn brown and smell nutty not necessary but very nice as are sliced green onion tops you can cut those at a steep angle they look especially pretty you could be nice and eat this with a knife and fork but come on these flanking ones are dying to be finger food and that's really the only way you can gnaw all the meat off around the bone total umami meat candy explosion that is thanks again to all the korean folk on instagram who helped me work this recipe out i apologize if you're bothered by any of my customizations speaking of which if you're wondering what i did with the other half of the meat that we prepped check it out same exact dish but with caribbean flavors instead of asian ones i'll put that recipe out as a bonus sometime soon

This isn't really a recipe. To make a fruit syrup, put some fruit in a pot...",29:02.6, snow cones shaved ice slushies raspa kagegori patbingsu a million names for it around the world in a million variations but the basic concept is some form of pulverized ice that's flavored with some kind of syrup very easy and fun summertime dessert to make at home i'm going to show you a few simple ways of doing it without buying a dedicated ice shaving machine i'm only using gear that i already had at home fruit syrup whatever fruit you want into a pot these are cherries strongly flavored fruits like berries or citrus usually work best no need to pit or peel anything just throw in a little water at most enough to cover put the heat on high and the water is just there to keep the fruit from burning on the hot pan surface before it's had the chance to release its own water then you just boil the fruit until it starts to fall apart a delicate berry might just take a couple minutes cherries like these are more robust they took 20 minutes but you can help things along by taking a masher and just smushing things a bit if the pan never starts looking too dry too thick stuff might stick to the bottom and burn so put in a little more water i think you want the fruit just soft enough that you can easily press all the juice out of it but if you cook it for way too long it'll start to dull the flavor so when it's just soft pull it off the heat get yourself a bowl of some kind and a fine sieve on top pour everything in there and this is why we didn't have to worry about pitting or peeling anything all the solids are going in the trash though before they do i'll grab a stiff spoon and kind of grind them into the sieve you'll be amazed how much more juice you can get out this way now i'll take my little pot and rinse it out just to get rid of any chunks i don't want in my syrup back on the stove it goes and in goes the juice the quantity of sugar you want is up to you and will depend on how sweet the fruit already was how much water you did or did not boil out i think a roughly equal quantity of sugar is probably the maximum of what you'd want but be conservative you can always just taste and adjust later just bring that to a boil on high get everything dissolved and you'll know enough water has evaporated and you've got about the right sugar concentration when the bubbles start to stack on top of each other like that that's a light syrup right there pull that off before it bubbles over when it's cooled a bit you can very cautiously have a taste that's got enough sugar for me but i think it needs more acid so i'm going to supplement the cherries with lime juice remember we're using the syrup to flavor a completely flavorless substance water ice so by itself it should taste way too sweet and way too tart mason jars are great for storing this but pour it in whatever it probably should be covered and refrigerated to be safe and if you're in a hurry to use it the fastest way to cool it down is in a bowl of ice water just give it a stir every now and then now how do we make snow in our house let's try the food processor first dump in some ice cubes from the freezer and pulse it a few times very loud look inside as is typical for food processors there's a few large chunks that are spinning around and not hitting the blades you could just toss those out or keep pulsing it but beware eventually the rest of the ice will start melting in there put that into a little cup and pour in some of our cherry syrup it should look like not quite enough syrup at first because it'll keep slowly spreading through the ice as you eat that's tasty but the chunks are kind of big like tiny pebbles let's try the blender blenders are more narrow they have smaller blades and they often have ice crushing settings on them see that automatically pulses the blade very easy and there's no giant chunks escaping the blade that's got a finer consistency almost like natural snow that's definitely my favorite of the two options but what if you wanted something more like hawaiian shaved ice wide thin flakes well you could fill up a pan with water the wider the better throw that in the freezer for a few hours and when it's good and solid you get it out and it's time to shave the ice am i right now that wouldn't actually work but harry's is the sponsor of this video so let me take a moment to thank them i'm a harry's man all day long have been since long before they started supporting my work here they're simply the highest quality shaving products for the money the founders jeff and andy realized that razors were getting way over designed and overpriced so they bought a blade factory in germany and now refills of these crazy sharp blades start at just two dollars i love the weighted handles and the textured grips i love the kind of mature manly fragrances the personal care products have this is like the only body wash i can find that doesn't make me smell like a 38 year old frat boy and hey in these crazy times harry's is donating a million bucks and shaving supplies to hospitals masks do seal better over clean shaven faces you can get a trial set just like this one from harry's for just three dollars if you follow my link in the description that's a great deal and you'll be doing us both a favor three dollars harry's dot com slash adam r link's in the description thank you harry's and i have tried many implements for shaving ice like this but here's the clear winner a large steel chisel just remember whenever you cook with gear from the hardware store to wash it thoroughly first a tool like this comes coated in a non-food oil you just lightly scrape across the surface don't push too hard or you'll dig in and get big chunks it works even better as the ice starts to melt and the water serves as a lubricant on the blade look at that it's not as good as what you get from one of those ice shaving machines you can buy but those are still some pretty wide delicate flakes lauren was into it the thing about it is i always loved slush puppies as a kid yeah but they were so sweet that they made your teeth hurt and made you feel kind of sick and this is refreshing in the same way but way better okay let me give you some other ideas for flavors you could do kumquats delicious little citrus fruit originally from china a little more complex of a flavor than orange and more tart which is good for this and no need to peel or seed them or anything straight in the pan strawberries would be classic they're delicate so they'll cook soft really fast but to make their flavor a little more sophisticated i'll reach for rhubarb looks like celery tastes like bitter citrus classic complement to strawberries in dessert blueberries again they cook real fast and their pigment will be very intense in a syrup it might sound odd but i think lemongrass is a fantastic complement to blueberry chop it up and in it goes and here's a fruit that i normally avoid pomegranate i avoid it because it's such a pain to eat it's like the blue crab of the fruit world you got to tear through so much structural matter to get to those juicy little jewels inside and even when you do there's hardly anything edible on them like half the mass there is a seed at the center of each one but if we're just making syrup with them we don't have to worry about any of that that white stuff the mesocarb that can go into we'll just strain it out later with all the seeds a little water in each pot just to get them started heat on high bring everything to a boil those kumquats have a pretty robust skin on them so they'll definitely need some help from the potato masher go easy they will squirt on you cutting them in half before you put them in would accomplish the same goal those blueberry skins are surprisingly tough a little mashy mash same deal with the pomegranates and in contrast the strawberries turn to mush in just five minutes they're done strain and grind return to the rinsed pan don't let any of those get too dry if they get too thick and concentrated they'll stick to the bottom of the pan and burn in a flash keep them topped off with water blueberries strain and grind i swear that lemongrass works great with them return to the rinsed pan kumquats give those a really good grind to make sure you squeeze all the juice out of the skins back in the pan pomegranates good lord it's all seed i don't know how people eat these things poor yield again up to an equal quantity of sugar for each but be conservative you can always add bring them all to a boil get everything dissolved and when the bubbles start to stack up on themselves you have syrup give them all a taste remember that syrup can reach much higher temperatures than water so good lord blow on that spoon first the blueberry one really needs lime juice the strawberries need more acid too but i'm gonna use balsamic vinegar might sound odd but that's a classic pairing with berries really good by the way if any of these colors aren't quite as vivid as you were hoping for hey nobody has to know pour them all into your glasses and into the snow we go notice the syrup is a little thicker i refrigerated these overnight i find the colder syrup flows a little slower and therefore spreads more evenly instead of just falling to the bottom of the cup it'll keep working its way down gradually as you eat i think the kumquat one is probably my favorite but you know about me and acidity once you have these syrups you can do a lot of other things with them too mix them with an equal quantity of club soda easily convertible into a grown-up beverage drizzle them on pancakes dilute them with a bit of water and freeze them as popsicles go nuts or don't make any syrup at all and just pop open a can of sweetened condensed milk some people pour this on water ice some people use ice made of milk i think it's great either way and i like the korean way of doing it where they put lots of different garnishes in the cup that you can dose out in different combinations sweet cream cherries and snow that's a dessert a roman caesar would have eaten and for us mere plebs in the 21st century a dessert like this is arguably a lot better suited to the home kitchen than say ice cream hey have fun get creative and have a great rest of your summer

Salmon. Salmon burger — easily my favorite burger
not made out of a large land animal, and in a way I think they're actually easier to cook
at home than hamburgers. The key, in my opinion, is respecting the
fish — not pureeing it, and not turning it into a glorified crab cake. There will
be no mayonnaise, no eggs. The binding protein will be the fish itself, though I will put
in like one diced shallot for two burgers. A salmon patty is very soft, so it's nice
to have some al dente vegetable bits in there for texture. You could use some onion instead,
but cut it real fine, or it'll be a little too al dente. Some fresh herb — dill is the classic choice
and it looks really pretty in the patty, but tarragon would be great. Parsley would be
great. Into a bowl that goes along with a big spoonful of mustard. I've got dijon there.
This not only tastes great, but it helps to bind the burger together. And I'll do a little squeeze of lemon juice
just to freshen the flavor. Don't go crazy – remember the mustard is acidic too. I'll
grind in some pepper and then SUMMON FORTH THE UPSIDE DOWN BEAR. A tiny little squeeze
of honey really makes this come alive. You could put in your salt at this point,
but if you do, you'll need to cook your burgers right away. If you salt the inside of the
fish mixture and then let it sit a long time, the salt denatures the proteins and the texture
goes really crumbly, not in a good way. When in doubt, just season the outside of the patty,
which is what we'll do here. And here's my two wild salmon fillets. Farmed
would be fine, but look at that color. These are each like 5 or 6 ounces, 150 grams or
so. Each one of those is enough meat to make a good-sized burger, and we need to get the
skin off. If you've got a good sharp blade, you can just lay it down parallel to the board
and shave the meat off. Unless you're amazing with a knife, you will
get some waste that way. So, another option is to pick up the fillet and literally peel
the skin off with your fingers. You are totally going to mangle and mash the meat in the process,
but guess what? We're making a burger, so that doesn't matter. We're gonna cut this
into little pieces anyway. Look — zero waste. If you have a lot of water coming out onto
the board, you might want to blot it up. If the mixture is too wet, it won't hold together.
I'm just stacking the fish on top of itself, and I'm going to dice it up. Thin strips this-a-way,
and then thin cuts that-a-way. I'm trying to get maybe a quarter-inch or
six millimeter cube at the largest. Anything bigger than that will tend to just fall out
of the burger during cooking. Now I'm going to take two thirds of this and
push it into my bowl. The remaining third I'm going to hack into oblivion. Go full-on
Iron Chef on this stuff. I'm trying to blitz this into a paste. Some people do this in
the food processor. I think it's a pain to get it out and get it dirty, and a full-size
food processor is not very good at pureeing such a small quantity of stuff. It all just
sticks to the sides. Once I've got it as fine as I can get it,
I might even lay down the side of my knife and grind the fish against the board – mashing
this into a paste. Not very appetizing, I realize. But this is what's gonna hold our
big, luscious chunks of salmon together into a burger. It obviates the need to use egg,
which I think is gross in burgers. There, that right there is a product more structurally
analogous to ground beef, and you could cook it, but it would have the texture of like
a cat food burger. Into the bowl that goes, and now unfortunately
you do need some breadcrumbs to help hold this together. Any kind is fine. I just think
the trick is to use as little possible. Work it in, let the breadcrumbs saturate into a
starchy paste, see if the mixture is now sticky enough to mold into a burger. If it's not,
mix in a little more breadcrumbs. Beef patties tend to change in shape a lot
during cooking. They shrink, they bunch up on themselves. These will change very little,
so mold them into the final shape and size you want for your bun. These are delicate, so I'd definitely recommend
a nonstick pan for this, or I'm using my cast iron, which has a nice new coat of seasoning
on it. Very slick. Medium-low heat. That's all you need. Hamburgers you have to blast
in a smoking-hot pan. Salmon burgers cook best nice and easy, and that butter is telling
me the pan is too hot. Butter is delicious with salmon, and I also
like how it doubles as a pan thermometer. Now we can season the outside of our burgers,
at least the first side, and I'll lay those in salt-side down and kinda scoot them around
for their first few seconds in the pan. That'll help them keep from sticking. Once they're
in, I can season the other side. Everything up to this point has been harder
than making hamburgers, but this part is gonna be easier. These cook so slowly and gently.
There's no smoke, and no big rush — no tricky timing. Let the first side get nice and brown before
flipping. If you flip too soon, it might not hold together. Look at the burger pushing
juice out of the side there. That's an indication that the inside is starting to get cooked,
and it's really easy to tell when they're done. You just kinda push them. When they
feel firm on the inside, like they would hold together as one piece in the bun, they're
done. These took six minutes, total. Toasty bun I've had sitting in a warm oven
since I started cooking the patties, on one goes, and you could top yours however you
want, but I'm a big believer that slaw is the perfect topping for salmon burgers. Again,
they're soft, so this gives you some needed texture. I made this with bagged pre-cut slaw mix.
Love it. If you bought one of each of the cabbages and carrots and broccoli represented
in here and then cut them yourself, you'd have way too much slaw. A big glug of vinegar. Rice wine vinegar is
my all-purpose vinegar, but use whatever. Now, just enough mayonnaise to bind this together.
When I said no mayo in the recipe, I meant no mayo in the burger, like people would put
into a crab cake. Crab has no fat. Salmon has plenty of fat, so it doesn't need mayo,
but the slaw does. Big pinch of sugar into this, little pinch
of salt, and you don't have to use this, but one of my favorite spices — celery seed.
Great in slaw. The flavor of celery without the texture that some people find objectionable. I can already tell I'll want some more vinegar.
Stir that up and then have a taste. Needs even more vinegar. This slaw is a condiment.
It's for flavoring other stuff. It should taste too intense on its own. Think about
how sweet or tart a spoonful of ketchup or mustard would be if you ate it straight up.
That's the vibe you probably you want here, and do this hours in advance, if possible.
It'll get better in the fridge. Top bun on, and isn't that pretty? Unlike
a fully pureed patty, that actually looks like salmon — there's identifiable flakes
of fish in there, and they give great texture in the mouth along with that crispy, cool
slaw. Here, I'll cut it so you can see — the tiny bits of salmon we hacked up are filling
the gaps between the bigger chunks we cut. Excellent. Let me give you some other ideas about how
you could flavor a burger like this. Here's a little thumb of ginger. I'll just roughly
peel it. You don't have to get off all the peel. And then I'll just dice that as fine
as I reasonably can. You could grate it instead. One or two scallions or green onions. I'll
peel off any decaying outer layers. Those also often have dirt hiding inside them. When
you want particularly fine pieces, you can slice the scallion lengthwise first, and look
at that? Dirt. I told you. Didn't take off enough of the outer layers. Now I'll just
mow through those, as fine as reasonably possible. The white part and the green part together.
Scallions and ginger into the bowl. Instead of a spoonful of mustard for two burgers,
I'm using a spoonful of miso paste. Fermented soybean paste. This is yuzu-flavored miso
but any kind will be fine. Instead of lemon, a splash of my rice vinegar,
and we'll let you-know-who do his thing. Just a drop of honey really makes a difference,
but too much would be gross and it'd make the patty more likely to burn. Get the skin off the salmon. Cut into a hearty
dice and transfer a third of the fish to the bowl. Go ax-happy on the remaining third until
you have a fine paste and add that in. Just for pretty, and because I have some, I'll
scatter in some black sesame seeds. And then, just enough breadcrumbs to get this mixture
to hold together. The good news is the miso paste probably contained
enough salt for the patties, so we don't need to season. The bad news is we need to cook
these pretty soon or they'll develop that crumbly texture I talked out. Same medium-low heat, and I'm using virgin
avocado oil for this one. It's my new favorite thing, but use whatever fat you want. Whoops,
that oil's not hot enough yet. The fish should sizzle gently when you lay it in. I'll give
it a scoot for a few seconds to prevent sticking. Flip when they're browning and they seem just
solid enough to turn without breaking apart, then likewise, when you press them and they
feel solid enough inside, they're done. Again, this was six minutes total. Our slaw from before is simple enough flavor-wise
that it could work with this burger too, especially since we used rice vinegar. But I'll go the
extra mile and mix in some soy sauce, some more of those sesame seeds, and a little cilantro,
since I happen to have it. On that goes, and these East Asian flavors,
I think, are even better at complementing this beautiful fish, which was sent to me
by the sponsor of this video, the 8,000 or so small-boat salmon fisherfolk of Bristol
Bay, Alaska. Thanks for the apron, gang. Their season just wrapped up and they had
huge catch — millions of Bristol Bay sockeye salmon landed. You can spot sockeye by their
vivid color from the crustaceans they eat. It's one of the most sustainable and abundant
large fish you can buy, and you can get it frozen in the store, all year long. Unless
you live close enough to a salmon run to know one of these folks, all salmon you buy is
probably frozen at some point anyway, because it comes in all at once at one time of the
year, and that's fine. Today's flash freezing techniques are incredible. I thawed these
in a bowl of water for 20 minutes and they were gorgeous. Buy a whole fish, or a whole
side, have fillets tonight, burgers with the leftover trimmings the next night. You can
find Bristol Bay Sockeye Salmon near you and learn more about them at the links in the
description, and I hope those folks out on the boats think these burgers do their work
justice. Oh hey, real quick, I'm still accepting t-shirt
pre-orders for one more week as of this posting of this video. Merch store link is in the
description. Only one week left to order. Vinegar leg is on the right, over and out."

pancakes here's some ideas about how you can make them fluffier prettier fruitier or more of a chocolaty sugary late night abomination if you need the basic primer my pancakes 101 video is linked in the description and i'll start here with my basic batter in a large heat safe measuring jug goes 2 tablespoons of butter 30 grams throw that in the microwave until it's not quite melted swish it around until it's liquid now we have melted butter that isn't too hot a couple tablespoons of sugar like 30 grams at this point you could absolutely just beat in the egg or you could take a page from the belgian waffle playbook and separate the yolk and the white yolk goes in the butter and sugar white goes in a bowl that should seem too big for the task and you beat it up with an electric hand mixer it literally takes a minute to get to stiffish peaks like that set those aside for a sec grab a fork or a little whisk or something and beat that stuff up smooth before you reach for the milk or buttermilk fermented milk it makes a huge difference in pancakes it tastes delicious and because it's so viscous it makes the batter thicker without making it tougher which flour will do enough to get two total cups of liquid so i put in like 400 mils big splash of vanilla teaspoon of salt like six grams many recipes including my prior one tell you to leaven this batter by neutralizing the acidic buttermilk with baking soda i hereby retract that double acting baking powder works better because of the delayed reaction it gets you the boost of gas you get when the batter starts cooking a heaped tablespoon like 16 grams and you could put in a little baking soda too if you wanted this will get you some additional lift and reduce how acidic the buttermilk tastes but if you like the acidity forget it you could use regular flour but i'm going to use cake flour this will get you pancakes that are more tender and moist about two cups or 230 grams but i really just eyeball this i stir in flour until i like the texture though because we have the additional moisture of the egg whites yet to come we have to mix this until it's a little thicker than we'd normally want it i'm really shooting for a pudding like consistency and remember to just barely mix it together little lumps are fine if you over mix the liquid in the flour the pancakes will be tough now here's why we whipped the egg whites in an excessively large bowl batter in and then we'll just cut and fold cut and fold trying to integrate that egg foam while popping as few bubbles as possible done i'm using my electric griddle greasing it with butter is delicious but that gets you a spackled appearance on the pancake surface that you might not like if you want that very even blonde surface i think the easiest way to get that at home is to use a teflon non-stick surface and don't grease it at all no fat on the griddle this has another advantage in that it allows you to cook at a higher than normal temperature i normally do pancakes on like two and a half out of five i'm using three and a half as always scooping the batter with a measuring cup is the easiest way to get pretty clean round shapes if we greased the griddle the pancakes would burn at this temperature but without the grease we can cook these hotter which cooks them quicker and gets you more lift when bubbles start popping in the center they're ready to flip lordy even with all this extra space i still managed to overlap them but you see what i mean about that even blonde finish and check this out look at how high these are rising that's two things the double acting baking powder and the egg foam insanely fluffy and so thick that they need some extra time to cook inside i wait until there's no sign of gooey batter on the sides and then i cook them for another minute out to a cooling rack which helps to avoid the steamy soggy bottom you get if you put them straight on the plate however if you want some melted butter on these you might want to put it on now instead of on the plate they might not be hot enough to melt the butter if you wait until they're on the plate syrup on and just wait till you see how fluffy the interior of these is egg foams do tend to make cakes a little firmer but i think using cake flour balances out that effect so pillowy it blows your mind and you can blow your mind some more with the

stream you get your first month free if you follow my link in the description and use my promo code regucia it's all down in the description thank you curiosity stream now say you want fruit in your pancakes blueberries are the classic choice and you could just dump them in the batter but by the time the pancakes were done the berries would break down a lot and that would make the inside kind of soggy some people like that but i prefer to place my berries right before the flip you can do the same with chocolate chips if you want to avoid the chocolate oozing out the pancakes are almost done and if i flip this around you can see how cooked those blueberries already look if they'd been in this whole time they'd be blueberry jam by now out to the cooling rack to steam off and look at those beautiful berries hiding in there rather than use maple syrup let's stay on theme and use raspberry syrup how did i make that some raspberries great way of using ones that are looking a little rough you need a lot to make syrup but you don't need a lot of this syrup because it's pretty strong a little water in there to get them started cooking and then boil them until they just start to fall apart it'll happen in minutes sieve over a bowl and drain mash the pulp look at how much the seeds swelled up in the boiling water that's good it'll keep them from squeezing through the sieve that juice goes back in the pan along with a roughly equal quantity of sugar and i'll boil it until it just gets syrupy that means the bubbles start to stack on themselves and the spoon leaves little trails off the heat this will thicken a lot as it cools you can just spoon that over your pancakes but i'm gonna be fancy and pour it into my squeeze bottle it's way stronger than maple syrup so go easy and we can cut the acidity of that with a nice dollop of whipped cream just a cup of cream beat it with a hand mixer until it's fluffy and you're leaving trails add sugar and vanilla to taste and keep it sealed in the fridge that is way fancier than anything i usually make for myself but damn it i'm worth it okay that's breakfast skip ahead 16 hours and we need a midnight snack let's make chocolate pancakes i'm doubling my sugar to balance the bitterness of the cocoa that's coming beat those egg whites and before we put in the milk or the buttermilk maybe half a cup of cocoa powder like 50 grams i prefer dutch cocoa that's the kind that tastes like an oreo mix that as much as you can and then this is important you got to mix in the milk a tiny bit at a time until you get the cocoa powder dispersed if you dump in all the liquid at once you'll never get the cocoa powder smooth if you're using natural cocoa not dutch i'd probably recommend using regular milk instead of buttermilk natural cocoa is pretty acidic and with the two acids together that could be a lot alrighty nice and smooth salt baking powder enough cake flour to make it seem too thick remember the egg foam will thin it out somewhat and this time i'm gonna put in my mix in straight to the batter i want some chunks of marshmallow so that's powdered sugar on the board and i'm just chopping some marshmallows into it without the powdered sugar everything would stick together you could just buy mini marshmallows i'm using what i had in the pantry and i also have some beautiful georgia pecans chop those up a bit in the marshmallow goes and you could do regular chocolate chips but i've got some peanut chips and yeah we're going to need a bigger bowl get that all folded together and then i'm going to butter my griddle because this time i'm going for taste not aesthetics speaking of which when you have really big chunks mixed in a batter it's virtually impossible to get nice round pancakes the chunks are just too jagged the marshmallow and everything will also start to really melt and ooze out and brown on the griddle which you could say looks ugly but it tastes real good i'm excited out to the cooling rack look at that oozy marshmallow on the plate and instead of maple syrup let's hit that with some caramel sauce how do i make caramel sauce a cup of sugar in a pan with a little water to get it melting put it on medium-high heat and boil it until it goes amber turn off the heat and then in goes a roughly equal quantity of cream but not all at once it would literally explode a tiny bit at a time see that was just a few drops hot syrup is very dangerous stuff show it respect if you don't have cream you could use like one part butter to two parts milk i'll let that cool down a bit so that i can put in salt to taste and don't be afraid to put in a lot of salt salt is magic with caramel it really rounds off the bitter notes in that goes to the squeeze bottle and on the pancakes chopped pecans i love that textural contrast and then a big dollop of our whipped cream you can see how adding the mix-ins up front causes them to kind of melt through the pancake if you don't like that drop them in right before the flip okay one last little experiment i've loaded some of that chocolate batter into my squeeze bottle minus the chunks of course my griddle is ungreased and the temperature is on the low side that's important i'll just make a little nine in there or is it a nine now just wait until that seems to set up pretty solid then grab a scoop of your regular batter and gently cover the chocolate shape wait for that to cook and then there we go p for pancake just remember to do a mirror image of whatever shape you want in the end or this will happen to you you could make it easy on yourself and just do a swirly do like that remember to let it set up solid before you put the white batter on top endless fun you can have with pancakes let me know what ideas you come up with next

Go to Squarespace.com for a free trial, and when you’re ready to launch, go to http://squarespace.com/ragusea and add code “RAGUSEA"" at...",29:02.6, you can make homemade ice cream with no equipment other than a pan or a big bowl a spoon and a freezer it's not the easiest or the best way to make ice cream i prefer the two bowls method and i have a whole video about that in the description but what i'm going to show you now is the simplest way to make ice cream and it can be a lot of fun if you get creative this recipe is sponsored by squarespace certainly the simplest way of making and running a website get 10 off yours with my link and code in the description this is called the still freeze method of making ice cream and you can do it with any ice cream base recipe but here is my go-to base three quarters of a cup of sugar 150 grams two cups of cream that's 475 mils 1 cup of milk 235 mils ideally evaporated milk that is milk that has been cooked in a vacuum pan the lower the air pressure the lower the boiling point so you can boil off a lot of the water without actually getting it that hot and changing the flavor of the milk very much though it does have a slight caramel flavor the main reason to use this over regular milk in ice cream is the protein content it helps make the ice cream smoother which is particularly useful when you do a no egg recipe like i'm doing here a big splash of vanilla and that is it eggless recipes require no pre-cooking therefore i think they're better for a bare bones kid-friendly ice cream making approach like we're doing today i'll just stir that up and if it feels like the sugar isn't all dissolving don't worry about it once this starts to freeze it'll become more viscous which will make stirring a lot easier and freeze it and stir it we will the wide pan is good because it creates so much surface area and helps the ice cream chill faster here in the freezer if you just have like a medium-sized bowl you could use that instead of the wide pan but i would cut the recipe in half the original recipe will make a quart of ice cream this will make a pint in the freezer that goes too until it just starts to go firm but not hard i let this first one get a little too hard i left it in there for 45 minutes and you can see all that milky ice i'm pulling off the sides i now have to break that up a little bit this would have been easier if i'd stirred it sooner let that be your lesson just break up all that ice stir everything around really well and throw it back in the freezer the bowl shape actually makes this a lot easier it's easier to scrape the frozen stuff off the sides and it's easier to mix it really vigorously back in that goes and that thing we just did we're going to keep doing that until it looks like ice cream half an hour later here we are scrape everything off the sides a wooden spoon is more gentle on your pan and stir really stir we need to spread all the cold evenly through the mixture yes from a physics standpoint heat always moves from the warmer thing to the colder thing but i think at a practical level it makes more intuitive sense to think about spreading the cold back they go into the freezer another half hour goes by that's starting to look like ice cream or mayonnaise scrape those corners that's where the cold is hiding and in addition to spreading the cold we want to think about breaking up any big ice crystals and whipping in a little air so stir really aggressively that's again a lot easier to do in the bowl you just can't make as much ice cream at one time in a normal bowl another half hour goes by i think 30 minutes is the maximum time to wait in between stirrings the more frequently you stir the smoother the finished ice cream will be this one in the bowl is looking done after just two hours and four stirrings the one in the pan needed another half hour two and a half hours and five total stirrings you're done when it looks and tastes like soft serve ice cream which is exactly what this is what would happen if you never stirred it at all if you just threw it into the freezer well it would look like this this is not ice cream this is just a sweet greasy ice cube because it has huge ice crystals the frequent agitation of churning creates a frozen sweetened cream filled with lots of tiny ice crystals and a little bit of air aka ice cream we could just call that done or we could put some stuff in it any chunkies you want get creative i'm crumbling a bunch of chocolate chip cookies into this one perhaps the easiest way to make a fruity ice cream is to stir in some jam or preserves i've got this beautiful local blackberry jam and stir in as much as tastes good to you be aware though that you're introducing a lot of heat back into the mixture same deal with the cookies so you'll have to send it back through one or two more cycles of freezing and stirring here's the blackberry ice cream after just another half hour that's perfect i don't know if it's the sugar or the pectin or what in the jam but jam really smooths out the texture and seems to regulate the ice cream's temperature homemade soft serve tends to melt really fast but this is really holding its own nonetheless you could cover it up and leave it in the freezer for now fat tends to absorb freezer odors so once you're ready to leave this in there overnight you really want to get it sealed that cookie ice cream needed two more freeze stir cycles so it took three hours and six total stirrings eat it soft serve or freeze it overnight let it harden no it will not freeze into a greasy ice cube we have seeded it with lots of very small ice crystals and some air it will simply set from soft serve ice cream into hard ice cream look at that granted the ice crystals in it are on the large side for ice cream noticeable on the palate this is a crude ice cream churning method that results in a crude product but it's still really delicious the jam ice cream is interesting like i said the jam seems to regulate its temperature and that cuts both ways this has been in the freezer for 24 hours and it's still pretty soft and fast melting oh well let's call it permanent soft serve then it's not a bug it's a feature okay let's do another one the ideal vessel for the still freeze turning method may just be a huge bowl assuming you have one and assuming you can fit it in your freezer i'll do a full one quart batch in here two cups of cream one cup of milk preferably evaporated and say you want chocolate ice cream even if you're doing a no egg recipe you generally have to pre-cook a chocolate ice cream base for the simple reason that cocoa powder does not disperse easily in cold or room temperature liquid i doubt you want your chocolate ice cream chunky style so you could just cook any chocolate ice cream based recipe you find cool it down again and then churn it or you could swap out the sugar in my basic recipe for chocolate syrup instead of three quarters of a cup of sugar put in three quarters a cup of chocolate syrup 175 mils yes a lot of the mass in here is cocoa but you'll still end up with enough sugar because this is made with corn syrup which is sweeter than cane sugar don't think too much about it just taste it if you want more put in more i think i did like a cup total in the freezer that goes for its first chill curious about this creepy green pan i've got in here this is just my normal base recipe plus a splash of almond extract instead of vanilla extracts are the easiest way to flavor ice cream orange extract lemon mint go crazy but because extracts don't much affect the appearance of the ice cream people usually put in some food coloring too yes i know almonds aren't green but neither is mint extract you know none of this is natural be aware the food coloring usually looks more vivid after it is frozen here's the chocolate after half an hour scrape down the sides break up any frozen stuff and spread that cold around the bowl shape really does make it easier than the pan shape how many freeze and stir cycles you have to go through depends on the shape of your vessel the power of your freezer all kinds of things but generally you're talking about a two to three hour process most of that time being unattended it's a totally easy and fun thing to do if you're just in for the night watching tv or something it's a literal netflix and chill so here's the finished chocolate soft serve who wants some chunkies i'll put some m ms in a tea towel and bash them a bunch of times with the bottom of a pot a food processor would certainly be easier in those go and remember they're introducing a lot of heat so this will need another freeze and stir cycle be careful about stirring this too much now it'll make the m m colors bleed that's why you can't put them in at the beginning though other chunks you could put in at the beginning terrific soft serve texture i think i'll eat whatever doesn't fit into my one quart freezer container remember that chunks will add significantly to the volume of the final product so we've got more than a quart here here that is after it's hardened for 24 hours harden it overnight at least i'd say delicious now for my green almond ice cream i could put in chocolate chips but i want to try what the italians call a straciatella ice cream you just take some solid chocolate and just barely melt it if you're using the microwave pull it before you see the chips visibly melting they'll liquefy as you stir you can do this the old-fashioned way over a double boiler you just don't want to get it too hot because melted chocolate has this weird property where it actually starts to get firmer as it gets hotter and we need this to be as liquid as possible so just barely melt it we want to take the finished ice cream out of the freezer and then drizzle thin strands of chocolate all over it i think they generally use a piping bag for this and here is why that blob is way too big you're trying to make thin crispy ribbons of chocolate not giant hard chunks yeah learn from my mistake use a piping bag the chocolate solidifies instantly upon hitting the ice cream and then you just stir to break it up into thin little chips we've obviously melted this a ton so that'll need a couple more freeze and stir cycles man almond and chocolate is a great flavor combination in that goes to harden and you can see what i mean about the color being a little bit more vivid when frozen flavor wise that might be my favorite of all of these but they're all delicious the whole point of making ice cream at home instead of just buying it is to have fun and to let your creativity run wild chuck whatever you want into your ice cream and see what works the steel freeze
