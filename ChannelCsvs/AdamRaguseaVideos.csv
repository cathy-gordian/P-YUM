close at home but as always you'll be limited by your oven which probably doesn't get quite as hot as the ovens they use at buddies and it does make a difference that's a darn good pizza though easily my favorite of the thicker crust Styles you'll want to get a cup of water per 110 inches of pan area I've got that in metric in the description My Pan area is 165 inches so I need a cup and a half of water 355 mils a teaspoon and a half of dry yeast a teaspoon and a half of salt and I'm not going to bother measuring my bread flour at Buddy's their dough is about 65 percent hydration which would be about 550 grams of flour here that's about the hydration you're going to get if you just stir in as much flour as you can stir in with a spoon cover and let the particles hydrate let the gluten autolize for about 20 minutes come back dump in a little more flour that was probably too much flour your ham hands and you can more easily get the dough off of the spoon and then just knead the dough a little bit it's wetter now after resting so it will absorb a little more flour and after the auto lice you really only need to knead it for like a minute to get it stretchy 60 to 70 percent hydration is about that sticky sticky does are hard to work yes but it's really quite easy to push dough into a square pan so don't worry about it being sticky lean on the side of it being too sticky now I'll cover and actually let that rise for a couple hours or so until doubled during which time I can work on my cheese the original traditional Detroit style pizza is made with Wisconsin brick cheese which can be hard to find so I had to order an absurdly large block on the internet in effect it's kind of halfway between low moisture mozzarella and cheddar cheese this is a little more mature and funky and yellow than the brick cheese that they use at buddies but man does it melt really well and taste great I'm cutting off about 200 grams seven ounces for my pizza sure you could use a young better instead or low moisture mozzarella or a mixture of the two instead but you could also buy a big block of brick cheese like mine cut it up into portions and then freeze those for later semi-firm cheeses usually freeze and thaw really well at buddies they grind their cheese rather than shredding it they want bigger pieces to slow down the melting it's because a thicker Pizza needs more thyme in the oven and so you don't want the cheese to cook too quickly I can get a similar effect by just chopping this cheese into pretty coarse chunks and then once I've done that I'm actually going to throw this in the freezer in my home oven it's going to take even longer to bake and brown a thick crust so I want the cheese to melt slowly otherwise it's going to be a broken or even burned Mess by the time the pizza itself is done if you chill it you slow it down oh hey here's my sauce in the freezer buddies like many classic American pizza places uses canned tomato product from a company called Stanislaus that almost exclusively serves commercial operations hence this absolutely gigantic can I had to order off the internet I don't know if buddies uses this particular product from Stanislaus 711 ground Tomatoes but it's a favorite among New York pizza places and it legit tastes amazing I don't know what they do differently at Stanislaus but it works not an ad I cracked open the can I transferred its contents to ice cube trays and now I can thaw out exactly how much I need for a pizza anytime I'll need about a cup of sauce 237 mils for this pizza obviously you can just use the best canned smooth tomato product they have at your store whatever herbs and spices you like I'm using oregano and Thyme and a little garlic powder and some pepper buddies sauce tastes like they use those similar things but they go easy on the spices it's a very plain sauce I don't know if they do any olive oil in there but I really like that taste I do know their sauce is a little looser than this so I'm watering it down a little bit that looks about right the dough still needs to rise another hour so I'm gonna go chill maybe take a bath and enjoy some body wash from native sponsor of this video for the holidays I've got some scents from the special naughty and nice collection imagine how popular you'll be this time of year if you smell like sugar cookies spiked eggnog or my favorite warm cider and cinnamon I think I'll scrub a dub with spiked eggnog as I drink actual spiked eggnog which smells exactly the same as the body wash native body wash gets you a rich foamy lather even without the sulfates usually needed for foamy liquid soaps you get a nice residue free clean on your now silky smooth skin native uses really simple plant-based ingredients vegan and cruelty free and ph balanced with citric acid they have so many awesome creative scents not just the Christmassy ones native also makes deodorants and hand and body lotion treat yourself or someone on

this is a limited time offer with code regusia 6 you can also get 20 off any deodorant or lotion thank you native dough has risen and now it's time to get my pan what I've got is an 11 by 15 inch pre-seasoned Blue Steel Detroit style pizza pan that I bought online it's pretty similar to the ones they use it buddies I seasoned it again when I got it home you could absolutely just use a big aluminum cake pan or a half sheet pan your crust might not get quite as brown but it'll still be good we got to spread a film of olive oil all over the interior surface and we especially cannot forget the sides and the corners if the pizza sticks it's going to be up here so get oil there plus we want the oil to create that slightly fried Edge that is characteristic of this style pizza not too fried however I'm going to use a paper towel to get out some excess oil if there's too much oil you get a donut like effect that is just not right while your hands are still oily grab your risen dough plop it in the pan and do an initial stretch try to get it into as even of a rectangle as possible but don't stress if it snaps back on you and you can't get it to stay tucked into the corners we will now let this rest covered let it proof for about half an hour and now it is Puffy and the gluten is relaxed I can stretch it out into the corners which you want to do because the corners are the best part just be gentle and don't deflate the dough you can always let it sit and poof again for a few more minutes if you deflate it the basic buddies Pie has a layer of small pepperoni slices under the cheese I could only get big slices so I'm cutting them into quarters before I lay them on small pieces mean you won't have giant slices of pepperoni sliding out of the pie and onto your lower lip as you eat cheese layer goes on next our cold coarsely chopped brick cheese that will melt nice and slow in the oven at buddies they make an effort to let some cheese fall along the side where it can Brown against the hot metal now the sauce goes on top similar to Chicago style pizza but unlike Chicago they do not flood the top in Detroit at buddies they do three narrow strips they call racing stripes in tribute to the Detroit automotive industry as a result most of the cheese will still be able to Brown and that is good I've had my oven heating as hot as it can get for about a half hour and in we go highest possible setting convection if you've got it my pizza took about 15 minutes basically you have to pull it when the cheese is starting to break really bad when the casein proteins tighten up and start squeezing out orange grease I wish my crust was a little darker by now but that's just how it is baking at 550 Fahrenheit in a domestic oven instead of the 7 or 750 oven they use at buddies let the pie rest and solidify for a second but you'll want to get it out of the pan pretty quick to avoid a Soggy Bottom use a metal spatula to go around the edge and scrape off any cheese or crust that is sticking I imagine this pan will get less sticky the more I use it and the more that seasoning layer develops then I can use that spatula to get up under the pie and help me kind of lever it out at buddies they would cut this into eight rectangular pieces and so shall I if New Yorkers are thinking hey that looks like Sicilian pizza yeah Detroit Pizza is descended from Sicilian svichione not as dark as I'd like it but that edge is still awfully crispy and we've got some decent golden brown on the bottom the crust is nice and light and springy and I love the heterogeneity of having sauce in like narrow stripes on top but the real secret to the flavor is the hidden layer of pepperoni on the dough really great if you can I think you should go to Detroit and taste the real thing for yourself at buddies but if you can't go to Detroit that is like 85 percent the authentic product and it's a great way to make a lot of pizza for a large group at home much love to the Motor City,3
Why people cook with caustic alkali,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QDAu9shX8Xg/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLDdqfBg2cx1HvGWWlFr1744_0htgg,QDAu9shX8Xg,"10 minutes, 2 seconds",Thanks to LetsGetChecked for sponsoring this video! Got to https://trylgc.com/ragusea and use my code ADAM25 for 25% your at-home test kit.,2022-12-01 14:47:05.182271, how in the world did people start cooking food in dangerously caustic alkaline Solutions olives soaked in lye fish soaked in lye eggs soaked in lie bread soaked in lye why did people first start doing this I mean acids can burn your skin off too in sufficient strength and concentration but it's easy to understand how they ended up in food we like how they taste we like the taste of sour things within reason and there's probably a lot of reasons for that but one is certainly that we need vitamin C ascorbic acid if we don't get it then we get scurvy and we die and so we evolve to like the taste of sour fruits for example that makes sense but on the other side of the pH scale bases usually taste bitter and scientists think we evolved our bitter taste sensation chiefly as a warning bitter things are likely to be toxic so in this lye water we have a basic solution that can cause chemical burn and tastes bitter and gross so how did it end up in food well this is a topic anthropologists have explored a little bit particularly as it pertains to traditional corn maze processing here in the Americas but nobody really knows and it probably depends on a case-by-case basis I'm going to talk about one possibility today with you that I'm pretty sure played a role a basic solution is one that contains a lot of hydroxide which is a negatively charged hydrogen and oxygen ion an acidic solution in contrast has a lot of positively charged hydrogen that explanation is an obscene oversimplification and alkalinity and basicity are not exactly the same thing even though people like me use those terms interchangeably and I'm going to in this video but today we're doing amateur anthropology not amateur chemistry so get over it anyway one Surefire way that food and bases got mixed up is fire ashes are full of bases particularly ashes made by the burning of certain plants like hardwood trees Hardwoods reproduce via flowers and fruits and such flowering and fruiting requires a lot of potassium so there's a lot of potassium in the wood and when you burn the wood in a really hot fire you drive off most of the carbon in the water and assorted volatiles you're going to be left with a powdery white ash containing potassium carbonate potash time out to say that pot ash is one of the terms we're going to be using today that has like a lot of different definitions it doesn't just refer to one thing potash also refers to various potassium-bearing minerals that are mined and used as fertilizer among other things but the name descends from a scenario like this where ashes and pots mingle when the Ash gets in the water chemical reactions ensue that raise the pH of the water you get a basic solution it seems possible to me that one day some ancient person was boiling some food on or near a very hot fire the wind was blowing and that supplied lots of oxygen to the fire making it burn even hotter but it also blew lots of Ash around and a ton of pure white ash got into the water enough to raise the ph significantly then this ancient person noticed that the ash seemed to make the food cook faster high pH does all kinds of things to break down starches and pectins and proteins and a potato or something cooked in a basic solution is going to soften much faster I'll prove that to you with a test in a minute but if you need to prove something to yourself consider testing with let's get checked sponsor of this video let's get checked is a way for you to do all kinds of important Health tests at home by yourself without having to talk to anyone about it or get a permission slip from the horrible health insurance system we have here in the U.S I've been monitoring my testosterone and other male hormones regularly for a couple of years now because I'm 40 and my tea has been dropping really fast I've instituted some lifestyle changes that have correlated with a slight Improvement in the situation but I am starting to talk to my doctor about hormone replacement therapy I'm not ready to be old and weak yet you can check yourself by ordering one of these kits the pricing is reasonable and transparent unlike when you go through your insurance you will know what this costs it ships in discrete packaging they make it super easy to draw your own blood don't be scared you send it back and within a few days your secure confidential results are online they're reviewed by a clinician and a let's

your test thank you let's get checked anyway ashes the fire is done and cooled I will sift the remaining charcoal out of the white ashes and then I will dump the white ashes into the nearest clear glass container just so that you can see what's happening in there the urn shape is unfortunate I swear this isn't Grandma kids anyway I'll pour in some soft water people historically would have used rain water which is generally pretty soft my tap water here is hard water meaning it's got lots of dissolved minerals and such and so stir in the bottled soft water and as those alkaline salts dissolve out of the ashes all of the solids and the insolubles and such they're just gonna fall to the bottom that's probably mostly calcium compounds and carbon at the bottom now I can just pour my lye water off the top lye is another one of these words that means a few different things nowadays it generally refers to sodium hydroxide which is a different thing although actually you probably would get a little sodium hydroxide out of wood ashes but historically lye just means kind of any basic solution any alkaline solution and actually the word lie is an old Germanic word that just means bath I wonder if maybe it came to be called that because lye water feels a warm on your skin I mean that's a light lie solution feel warm on your skin a really intense one will sear your skin right off but also might just be that lots of natural hot springs that people used to bathe in are naturally basic regardless historically lye has referred to all kinds of basic Solutions or the crystals you can precipitate out of these solutions by boiling all the water off this is probably mostly potassium hydroxide lye that I'm filtering off that I made with the wood ashes it happens when potassium carbonate from wood ash gets wet if we boiled all the water out we'd have caustic pot ash if we baked it in a kiln to burn off the impurities we would have Pearl Ash which was historically used as a leavener for bread I'm not doing any of that I'm just trying to raise the ph some more by concentrating my solution look we've still got impurities in there pH is a little over 10 which isn't super high that's not like yoga pants in Winter are basic that's just like pea coat in Winter basic you need a lot of Ash to make really powerful lye water but this is strong enough to prove my point I'm going to boil a little potato slice in some of this weak lye water for five minutes and this slice I'm going to boil in the same exact level of normal water normal water potato slices on the right this potato is kind of brown because bases lower the temperature at which the myard reaction occurs that's why we soak pretzels in lye it allows them to Brown thoroughly on the outside without overcooking the inside anyway that's part of why this potato is a little brown and check how easily I can tear it apart this slice we cooked just as long in plain water and I can't even begin to tear it apart ashy water Cooks things faster and I think ancient people would have noticed that and taken advantage of it ancient Americans might have noticed the same effect on corn maize a basic solution will make the indigestible skin slide right off the kernel and and that makes it way easier to grind corn into a paste the solution also gels the corn and yields a more viscous doughy paste that you can form into tortillas even though there's no gluten in corn like you have in wheat the alkaline treatment also deactivates these mycotoxins that are produced by Common molds found on corn and it also makes the niacin in corn bioavailable an essential nutrient a B vitamin if you don't eat it you get pellegra so Societies or Villages or communities that did this alkaline treatment on their corn well they would have outlasted the other ones next stimulization this process is called and wood ash may have played a role in the historical development of the process but that's not the whole story because you can also make a basic solution with rocks and other minerals that you can just pick up off the ground how people figure that out is another story that we're going to tell another day rocks depend on your local geology but everybody everywhere uses fire fire makes Ash and Ash is going to mix with water all kinds of ways in the pot or on the ground in a little pool or a pond where you dump your ashes people might have noticed that that super ashy water was totally inhospitable to life like no animals no plants no algae nothing could grow in such basic water and so maybe that's why it might have occurred to some of them to try preserving food in that water and that's one way we might have gotten Century eggs or lutefisks or lye cured olives you try preserving your olives in lye and you notice that the lye breaks down the bitter compounds in olives a whole lot faster than brine does and you notice it keeps them green or maybe that's not how we got like cured olives or lutefisk or Century eggs the world is a complex place and people simultaneously invent things in all kinds of totally different ways it's not one thing but I'm willing to bet you that at least some people invented cooking with bases when some ash just accidentally got into the pot because that's a thing that was simply going to happen,3

If...,2022-12-01 14:47:05.182271, it's the Adam regusia podcast episode 30. the Pod was going to be 29 for at least 10 more episodes but we talked to it we convinced it to age gracefully so here we are on episode 30 with my lovely wife Lauren coming along this time hello we're going to talk today about supplementation versus eating actual food and whether one is clearly better than the other especially when it comes to people who don't eat certain foods like vegans if you don't eat vegans you'll want to stick around for that but first we'll uh have a health question about drinking hey Adam uh I'm uh Mitchell uh I'm 32. I live in Vancouver Canada BC uh I have a question about drinking if I want to drink to get to that that that that level of drunk I'm a fairly big guy I guess right so it takes takes a fair bit I don't one or two you know I get a buzz but it's not the not the same I suppose um if I want to get to that level what's the healthiest way to do it I guess should would liquor be better because I would have to drink less and get less carbs less sugars or something like that it's so nice to see a young man from Canada thinking about his health you know really really doing some me time and some personal care right would have never occurred to me that if my goal was to get drunk I would also be counting carbs but but it's good on you for thinking good on you exactly so there's some ways in which there's a really straightforward answer to this question and there's some like less straightforward what's the opposite of a straightforward answer Meandering Meandering okay well that's sort of what we do here on the Adam Regency podcast I don't know if you know you probably don't listen to this stay tuned for um part two of our Midnight's conversation she's a Swifty 40 year old Swifty say it first of all I'm 39. okay oh how many years are you gonna be 39. well for two more months two more months a month and a week okay there you go for instance for point two years okay um all right so yes Mitchell if you are trying to get a little buzz on and do that in the healthiest way possible and from the way that you describe but it sounds like healthy to you means Trying to minimize calories glycemic load all that kind of stuff which makes sense that's I think for for most of us living in the developed world that's one of the things that we need to consider to try to live healthfully is to just eat fewer calories right we won't ask your liver what it thinks what healthier we'll get back to the liver in a second but let's just kind of focus on like on on calories okay um so first we have to remember that alcohol itself has calories alcohol the scientists generally figure has seven calories per gram which is considerably more actually than proteins and carbs which is usually four calories per gram and a little less than fats which are generally like nine calories per gram kind of makes sense because alcohol ethanol is actually really similar molecularly to to Fat which is one of the reasons why uh alcohol can dissolve fat and the other way around in in ways that like water can't um so the whole thing would go down there but anywho we're unscripted today by the way uh we the people who are watching this on YouTube uh we've done a couple of unscripted me and Lauren podcast just for the podcast feed lately and people say that they really liked them and so and then a lot of people wrote in to say that they preferred that to when I when I write from when I speak from highly prepared notes which is what I'm much more comfortable doing and I don't like to listen to myself talk this way but this is going to be really interesting because Adam knows all the science and I don't so I have done research right like I'm prepared this is not just gonna be like a a thing where I'm we're just gabbing like I've prepared my answers here hopefully this won't appear like Adam ragusia presents mansplain yes we'll try to avoid that hey buddy what's up uh no you cannot come down right now when we're done you can come down and play okay okay all right so wait upstairs until we're done okay thanks buddy so alcohol itself is an energy source which is why you can run a car on it right um it has calories now whether those calories are actually metabolized by your body as energy is kind of an interesting and somewhat open scientific question I mean to a certain extent they definitely are but apparently not everybody is equally able to metabolize ethanol calories as energy and and they're by eventually potentially fat storage um like I was just talking to a scientist the other day who happened to be of of East Asian descent and he he was mentioning how you know Asians are kind of known for when they drink um smelling a lot of alcohol and that's an indication that they're actually there's some some Gene in that gene pool that makes it less easy for the bodies of people of East Asian descent to metabolize booze into energy and so it ends up coming out in other ways you breathe it out extreme excrete it out of their skin maybe not the ethanol itself but kind of closely related things that you know metabolites of it all kinds of things um so it's that's not a thing that is fully explored by science yet we don't actually know exactly how many of the grams of alcohol that you consume end up converting into calories of of energy and then potentially eventually adipose tissue storage if you don't use all of that energy in your very very busy Physically Active night of drinking right if you're on the dance floor it's gonna be good for you yeah exactly that's right gosh I remember you know this is a funny thing because um like alcohol is arguably like the original performance enhancing drug yeah because is it don't the guys on the Tour de France they drink beers at night they do and they do that more for like carbo loading which is is something that was was unders came to be understood in the mid 20th century um carbo loading but early 20th century in the very beginning of the Tour de France the the cyclist would drink alcohol because the alcohol a dulls the burn in your legs right it dulls the pain and B it is a highly concentrated energy source and I remember one time when we lived in Indiana I I don't know this may have been before I met you um the darkest in the Dark Ages yes I went drinking at where was that place where we used to do karaoke that dive bar outside of town The Office lounge The Office lounge yep wow that place was a dump no it was great and also it was a great dump yeah we went there right before our wedding with some friends and you got up to do karaoke and I had never seen you do karaoke before so I didn't know how good you were oh yeah and he got to the mic and he said this one goes out to that girl right there who's gonna marry me and however many days and then you launched into Neil Diamond's Love on the Rocks it's a good song and you performed it well oh thank you well anyway this is I think before we met and I I had I had had a lovely evening of Libations at The Office lounge and I was pretty toasted and I needed to ride my bicycle back to my apartment which was just like a tremendously inappropriate thing to do right like the drunk is it illegal no yeah sure essentially drunk riding is just as bad as drunk driving don't do it I don't endorse I don't feel proud of this moment of my life but like I needed to ride my bicycle home in order to get home you go up this really really big hill on was that Third Street by the mall right it was really long long long big haul uh climb to get home and I just remember flying up that hill like I was like wow this is amazing like I could go for like five more miles up this hill I feel absolutely nothing in my legs it's great you know um so so anyway drinking healthfully um so you have to consider the calories of the alcohol itself off when you're trying to work out this equation but then we got to think about I suppose actually there's I don't even know why I discussed that just now because like you're going to have the alcohol no matter what the alcohol is the point right yeah I was asking should he have liquor or beer liquor or beer or wine or wine okay um never mix never worry that's that's actually not true but anyways um so uh wine is is a pretty standard product unless you get one of these like new like you know diet wines athletic wines which whatever why would you why would you do that to yourself yeah um so wine is generally going to be at 120 calories for a standard glass okay um beer I really can't tell you because beer is a far more variable product especially in aspects that would affect its caloric content so you're talking about anything from like maybe 50 calories in like a light you know Bud Light or something like that all the way up to maybe 300 calories in some you know like a like a a Guinness or something yeah like a Guinness like a a Scottish style or Irish style Stout that's like really really um for a moment there all of our Ireland reared up yes I know I know I know Scottish I understand but the thing is the Scots have similar beer Styles which is yeah exactly very thick like the ones that are almost like drinking oatmeal or like eating a loaf of bread yeah yeah yeah yeah right uh you're talking about a whole lot of extra just carbs in there um whether those carbs occur as starch or sugar doesn't really matter that much so don't worry about that don't be thinking like oh this beer is sweet therefore it's really going to hit my blood sugar and that's bad um I have bad news for you which is that starch is really just as bad as sugar because starch is so readily broken down into glucose by your body it's the the it's it's glycemic index is virtually identical right so it doesn't really really matter what amount like if it's like feels thick and bready and you know it's somewhere between a drink and a porridge like that's a lot of calories in that beer and I love beers like that like in the wintertime but you know you don't want to hit those too hard right so um the other thing to consider maybe is that um wine is arguably healthy in a way that beer is not which is the antioxidants right it's good for your heart yes yeah just like that Dad who's like you know well I always say I won glass of red wine with dinner every night you know enough for the antioxidants sure for the antioxidants dad not to make the rest of us tolerable that's bleak sorry but it's true Ellie that's actually like I mean a documented thing um red wine in particular it's the thing it's the stuff that makes it purple is what is a antioxidant and oh boy we have to do a whole episode about whether or not antioxidants are actually good for you because that's not a totally scientifically settled topic but it's generally presumed uh that antioxidants are probably good for you and red wine has them whereas like I can't think of anything that's really redeeming in a glass of beer right there might be there might be some things in the Hops that could be good for you I'm actually you know what I bet there are antioxidants and hops come to think of it so I take this back this requires further investigation but it seems like you should just take all of this and set it aside and if the goal is to get drunk quickly with no calories or low calories I mean like take a page out of the college freshman handbook and just drink Everclear well Everclear is not legal in every state in the United States it's so true that's true and I don't know if it's it wasn't legal in Georgia uh and I don't yeah because oh it was legal in Indiana yeah yeah I was able to because I was able to get it uh in Tennessee for a video I needed like pure ethanol for a video and uh you can show moonshine here no yeah that's true well I was amazed to see it in the store and I was like but anyway Mitchell is in Canada and I don't know what the statuses have ever clear isn't ever clear for people who don't know is grain alcohol yeah like it's like uh it's 190 proof I believe it is so that means it's 95 ethanol five percent water you for for really complex chemical reasons you can never get all of the water out of ethanol but this is just about all of the water out as you can get and it is just and it's cheap and disgusting you can mix it with things that taste good or like big trash cans full of red fruit punch ask me how I know oh I'm sure they were really glad to see you show up at that party huh only one time one time [Laughter] well I think there's another there's a better lesson that um that Mitchell could draw from the Collegiate the Collegiate Experience right okay um which is that of pre-gaming okay um oh pre-game calories don't matter they don't count no uh so rather than pre-game so pre-gaming uh you know in in the in the Collegiate environment generally refers to drinking alcohol at home because you can buy alcohol more cheaply retail than you can at a bar so you have a few drinks that you bought more cheaply from a liquor store at home and then you go out to the bar to socialize where drinks are a lot more expensive but you don't need to buy as many drinks there because you've you've you've already you've already gotten your evening started right um so why when I say pregame now what I mean is drink before you eat okay drink before you eat uh a Mitchell like you I I'm I'm a bigger guy I I weigh 200 pounds and you know I'm somewhat desensitized to alcohol at this point and you know when we have wine with dinner for me to feel anything I have to drink the entire content of the bottle that you don't drink and I drink a glass she's little she's a bird right she's a little baby bird no and and so like for me to get anything at all I have to drink the rest of the bottle if we're having it with dinner but if I drink before dinner then like one strong drink is enough for me to have a very pleasant buzz on right super super nice does not and it's and it's great why because intoxication happens when your body is not able to metabolize the alcohol fast enough we can a normal adult male is typically able to metabolize what is it 10 grams of alcohol an hour something like that basically the amount that is in a drink one kind of stand your drink one ounce of a of liquor is how they would Define it in the United States um and that's part of the reason that it's sort of calibrated like that is because that's the amount that your body can handle in a given hour um with all else being equal right your body can kind of break it down and eliminate it and that's fine it's when you start to exceed that rate that the alcohol kind of backs up in your system and goes up into your brain and does a whole bunch of really funny stuff up there so so when you dilute the alcohol in a in a bunch of food in your stomach what you're doing is you're basically slowing the rate at which it's actually going to be absorbed into your system um and this is when like pet ants in the comments will point out that like alcohol actually can be absorbed somewhat directly through the the lining of your stomach but that's that's not the whole story um it's you know it's absorbed in lots of places down through the whole system uh and uh and yeah if you have the alcohol with with food if you dilute it with a bunch of food you're just going to slow that whole process down and you're not going to get intoxicated so if your goal is intoxication which it is Mitchell and your goal is to do that in as few calories as possible yes I would suggest drinking hard liquor like my my drink of choice these days is scotch and soda and plain soda water no no no you know sugar in it at all um and and like all of the scotch drinkers are horse fight right now because I'm diluting their glorious product but like I like to I really enjoy the taste of it and I like to sort of sip actively and if I sip actively on straight Scotch like it would be a problem it would be a problem around the house you know weird things would start happening right I feel like this whole segment needs a trigger warning because conclusion we've come to is like hey drink Everclear on an empty stomach that's good for you and it's not I feel like I think our audience is smart is is smart enough and that they can handle it all right or you know I hope that if people who maybe are not alcohol drinkers for whatever reason understand that this is a sure specific incidents and you just fast forward yeah well I think we got into it slowly enough you don't have to say a trigger warning for it to be a trigger warning right we made it very clear at many steps all right so anyways uh so yes I would suggest drinking kind of hard liquor with like zero cal mix-ins um and do that before you eat and you will need way less of it in order to get the the psychological effects that you so desire that is I'm sure the correct answer from like a biochemistry standpoint I don't know if that's the correct answer from a psychology standpoint or a human behavior stand standpoint and this is like the problem that science a mistake that scientists make frequently is that like they kind of stay within their their little um Silo and they figure out an answer that is correct within the confines of their field but they forget that like the the universe is not limited to their field right so so what I mean what I mean in this case is that if you follow my advice if you drink before you eat might the sort of knock-on effect of that be that you walk into dinner totally disinhibited you eat a ton and order more drinks right exactly yeah but can I also say that I feel like if you're reaching intoxication inappropriate amount over the span of say your week or your month in a way that won't be detrimental to your health overall you know you're like it's the weekend and I'm gonna have a fun night then have your fun night and drink what you want to drink and have a good time and just know that like I'm gonna have a good time and when I later on in the week I'm just gonna eat a little better but like an extra drink is not going to hurt you well I mean I might

alcohol is bad for you and that might not necessarily be true have you heard Honey about the studies that say that like light drinkers live longer no I have heard that drinking red wine is good for your heart um basically I've heard there's a study that says everything helps you live longer so and that everything will kill you coffee drinkers live longer but also they die quicker no actually that one's pretty consistent it's coffee coffee drinkers live longer see the new study that said that sorry um digression uh the new study that said they've discovered that the information that carb caffeinated beverages are not hydrating is flawed yes which explains how I made it all through college drinking only Fountain sodas from the dining hall and I didn't die I was hydrated it was fine it's a little more complicated than that but yes as all things are sure exactly but I was excited alcohol on the other hand is definitely a diuretic so keep that in mind but it is true 100 true that there are many many many studies that show that light Drinker drinkers or sometimes they might be called like social drinkers live longer than every other group of people meaning they live a little longer than people who don't drink at all abstainers um which is the kind of weird part right and then there's the like totally predictable part which is that like drinkers live longer than heavy drinkers right yikes because if you and light is usually in these studies considered to be about a drink a day on average right maybe a drink or two um a day on average and let's let's go ahead and like clarify that that doesn't mean drinking one glass of apple alcohol a day that could mean drinking three to four drinks twice a week yeah well three to four on one day and then four on one day three on the other day and that's that's seven do that you can do that twice twice a week right which which it sounds like that's the kind of thing Mitch in Canada likes to do uh it's the kind of thing I like to do I mean that's that's generally what I how I handle it um so yeah that's that's lots of studies find that that those people tend to live longer than everyone else once you go above that point once you start talking about like an average of three or four drinks a day um chance of cardiovascular disease increases significantly like a lot and then once you go way past that you know then that's when you start like melting your liver um yikes which or gastric cancer is another one uh when very heavy drinkers all kinds of gosh really bad things happen to you when you're an extremely heavy drinker but you're not supposed to pickle your insides no no no no no no and it's funny that you mentioned that because that's kind of one of the reasons why alcohol is really bad for you like because it it it it just it disrupts cell membranes it kills it causes cell death and that's what makes alcohol so good for preserving food right because it it'll it'll kill bacteria and such but it will also do that to your insides in sufficient concentration and quantity and with enough repetition right so a lot of alcohol is definitely bad for you what's weird is the finding that light drinkers are tend to live a little longer than abstainers and that's not just one study that's like study after study after study after study finds that to be the case so why might that be true no one knows but there are hypotheses what do you have a guess um maybe because a little bit of alcohol destroys some of the bad stuff that's in your body oh wow I wasn't expecting that one oh yeah isn't that's like that's like when President Trump said that we could kill kovid by injecting Clorox bleach into it okay it's not the same at all it's not no I don't know because everyone's always talking about like your microbiome yeah maybe you got some like bad bugs in your tummy yeah you have some alcohol in it clean that's not a terrible thought and I I kind of call me science yeah well that's the thing I wonder if that actually may be true in diets in less developed countries right uh where like food contamination yeah yeah is a bigger problem and I don't I'm not aware of any research that has looked at that specifically so graduate student out there there's another free ID this is why scientists should talk to non-science people because sometimes we think outside the box so far outside the box I was a history major I know nothing about science so what what is the reason that no one knows but here are some potentials all right so one is that um people who are social drinkers are social and that when you do the kinds of things that people who have friends do that's an indication that you have friends and having friends is really good for your health being married is good for your health or being in committed long-term relationships is good for your health right because it provides a social structure that pushes you to do things that are good for you like go to the doctor sure get out of the house yeah breathe fresh air move around do things yeah um and not be depressed and alone that's interesting yeah so that's definitely like a roundabout way of thinking of it well me I went straight for the like let's nuke all the bacteria in your tummy but well because you were just trying you were trying you were looking for a causal link but not all correlation is causation right um so in this case if that's true if an if that's true then what that means is that alcohol probably actually is bad for you in any amount it's just that it's not as bad for you like one drink a day on average is not as bad for you as having no social life is bad for you I would like to stay here for the record that I am skeptical that drinkers automatically have better social lives than non-drinkers well no especially if you think of all the abstainers who have abstained for religious reasons and are part of a huge religious community sure so I don't know if I buy that but interesting yes but a remember we're talking in aggregate we're not talking about individuals B um it's also important to remember that most of these studies just like most studies are of westerners right because that's where the money is and therefore that's where the science is most Medical Science most all of science is done in the West secondarily in East Asia which is in a number of ways the same place these days um there's not as much science that comes from say the Islamic world it's coming up for sure like it's common but it's not there yet um and and one thing that's interesting about the Islamic World in particular is that there you have a place where alcohol is very much religiously and culturally forbidden but like most cultures that forbid alcohol they do allow another drug there is a drug that is 100 socially accepted across the Islamic world and that is mean baby think about all the the tea think about like oh yeah pakistanis in their teeth think about the Turks and their coffee their freaking like motor oil sludge of coffee you know uh yeah no that's they they can't drink nice nice they can't drink booze so they drink tons and tons of caffeine and don't kid yourself caffeine is a psychoactive drug well so I was thinking about Mormons in the U.S as one does well because they don't do alcohol or caffeine they're the and they're the weird one in this one but but they do tons and tons of sugar yes so this is another theory or hypothesis rather as to why social drinkers might seem to live longer at least in studies done in the west is that um those people in the west who do not drink alcohol might have where alcohol is totally tolerated and it's it's not just tolerated it's it's it's part of our like Italy yeah yeah it's part of our religion our our secular religion and even our religion religion in the case of Catholicism right social cultural fabric exactly that's right like so so if you're looking at studies done in the west and a person is totally abstaining from alcohol that's an indication that they might actually have some other Vice that they do instead and one of those vices might be sugar right so for people outside of the United States who are not familiar with with Mormonism Mormonism is absolutely fascinating um uh Christianity Branch um that found itself in this kind of apostate status in the United States in the 19th century and a lot of them fled out west to the Great American West of Utah most uh centrally uh which was you know hardly populated at all at the time even by indigenous people I mean there were some indigenous people but not a lot right um and so they've been able to maintain this like really really interesting and really kind of coherent um subculture out there for uh you know decade after decade after decade and that includes abstaining from not only alcohol and drugs but also caffeine and so in Mormon communities what you have is this unbelievable sugar culture so there if you go out to um Salt Lake or Provo um soda shops like literal soda shops where you can get sodas that are mixed with like coconut cream or you know heavy cream or they make all these different caffeine free sodas and then crumble cookies those giant huge sugar bombs yeah I look at these these like Mormon sodas and milkshakes and stuff and it just I just have to go to the bathroom like I I'm like how does this not completely wreck you right so maybe some of the people who are abstaining die sooner because they're they're eating a horrible diet in order to get their yayas because they can't get them through caffeine or alcohol in the case of Mormons um the problem with that hypothesis is that I've ever been to Utah or Colorado or you know places where there's lots of Mormons like you're talking about like these are like the fittest places in the United States right um really really fit lean people um the Mormons generally are right and so yeah that that probably ain't it here's thing here's another thing that it might be okay it's called the abstainer bias and this is something that was only relatively recently can I guess what this is go ahead okay so the abstainer bias is where somebody who abstains I lost it I had it and it was oh damn it was right there so close is this is it about self-reporting the bias of self-reporting no okay okay what's a reason somebody might fully abstain from alcohol we've talked about religion because what's another one because they had a problem with alcohol and now they abstain nailed it see all right she's smarty she's the smarty this one yes yes when researchers ask you whether or not you drink alcohol a lot of the people who say absolutely no not one drop not at all are people who don't drink at all because they had a really big problem with it earlier in their lives and those Decades of heavy drinking that led them to abstain did permanent damage to their body that is going to shorten their lifespan it's the same reason why when you go to the doctor they ask if you've ever smoked not if you do do you smoke exactly exactly and when I was reading through the scientific literature on this like that that particular that particular abstainer bias was only relatively recently identified and now newer studies on that topic are taking it into account obviously like sorting out yeah are you an alcoholic in recovery okay push you over there precisely and we'll just look at the Mormons okay so there you go and then you know so there's some other hypotheses like you know mild drinking how can actually have positive psychological effects can help you manage stress and enjoy life a little bit more and that's all correlated with living longer you know uh but in general people don't know people don't know that said no amount of drinking or not drinking will allow you to live forever we're all getting older all the time me especially it feels like the same a little older we were born in the same year I am increasingly aware that I'm no longer a kid within my extended family I have become one of the Patriarchs which is terrifying I'm now one of the people in charge within the family my folks are they're leaning back into their retirements God bless them they cannot be The Keeper of the family knowledge and lore and genealogy forever that's gonna fall to me soon and that's why I have been using

the names of my parents and then I just clicked on instant discoveries which is exactly what it sounds like immediately I was looking at dozens and dozens of distant relatives I never knew existed and I have been fascinated to learn more about the non-italian side of my family my mom's side which I don't talk about as much because I don't I don't feel as connected to it on an ethnic level I feel very italian-americ and I was raised very Italian-American but my other half is mostly German that's a hell of a combination one might say that's a deep reference that almost no one is gonna get anyway my Heritage took me all the way back to my great great great great great great grandfather Johannes Valentine Fuchs Jr who lived in the 18th century in a tiny German town called Eisen um [Music] I'm gonna guess einstall tomb let's go with einsel tomb send us um pronounce no don't German people don't Germany of course didn't exist yet back then so we're talking about the Rhineland palatinate and this is hardly surprising given that lots of people from the Rye land fled to America in the 18th and 19th centuries you get lots of Catholic V Protestant Wars and other things happening there and people would want to flee and a lot of people from the Rhineland came to America around then lots of them uh became known as the Pennsylvania Dutch who invented a bunch of tasty food speaking of witch honey I uh time out on the ad for a second here I mentioned Pennsylvania Dutch in a video once and all the Germans and the comments freaked out because they thought that I was making a mistake because they're like haha he's saying Dutch he means Deutsch because Dutch is a person from the Netherlands in modern language yes whereas Deutsch's means German and they all were calling me a Rube but here oh oh oh the American was right the American was yes it's in this context Dutch is an anglicization of Deutsch and there is this like deeply rooted amazing culture in Pennsylvania and it actually goes into Ohio which is where my mom's side of the family is from of people who call themselves Pennsylvania Dutch and they are German they are a Deutsch just the word Deutsch became Dutch in this context so anyway you dumb not me dumb this time this time anyway my Heritage all the documentation and genetic analysis you could need to figure out who you are and where

it's actually about food supplements like I have been living vegan for about three years now great soup you should try it out and I've been supplementing since the very beginning of it all because I know that it is important and I did my research and I know that I should the question I have for you is is it biologically the same if I supplement with for example all my B vitamins and if I intake them with food does it change anything and if it doesn't change anything wouldn't a vegan diets with supplements not be equal if not better because I think if I take my supplement pill every day I probably have better intake of vitamins than a person that does not supplement and eats for example eggs and meat if you could shed some light on that I'd be very grateful okay my so first of all I want to say I love your style oh yeah the vibe is amazing Vibe fantastic killing it for people who are only listening to the podcast here you're missing my's Vibe you should go like queue up the YouTube just to check it out yes and that way I'll get two hits out of your viewership and we we appreciate that so the particular nutrient deficiencies that you worry about with veganism are as you say am I mostly B vitamins um in which case based upon all the research that I've looked at it's not it doesn't matter so much whether you're supplementing your B vitamins with food or not the reason they're called B vitamins historically is that they in the early days of research on this in the late 19th or the 20th centuries when people were first identifying vitamins they there was a there's a there was a two totally kind of different Paths of research one was into the water soluble vitamins and one was into the fat soluble vitamins and the fat soluble vitamins which is the first one that they discovered was vitamin A and which is why it's called a um and that one dissolves in fat can only be digested in the presence of fat like you have to have food you have to have some fat with your avitamins and your D vitamins and your e and your K in order to actually absorb those into your system the the reason that the B vitamins are under their own heading called B and A B B vitamin is not one thing it's it's like it's like what 12 now totally different things um but what they have in common is that they they're all water soluble and so if you drink you know a pill with water in theory you should be able to break that pill down and your body should be able to absorb it in the presence of water in your intestine and you're going to be just fine so in that sense I I it probably doesn't matter when you take your B vitamin pill assuming you're taking a pill um vegans might also just be deficient in protein you know probably not deficient in terms of like are you getting your essential amino acids such that you don't get a nutritional disease but this is one of the things that's always frustrated me honey whenever anyone asks me about like nutrition stuff is that they'll they'll come in and they'll be like vegan is actually certain vegans love to say this and be like you don't need nearly as much protein as you think you do well to survive or to thrive to thrive like and by Thrive of course I mean build muscle object right which as we all know is what life is all about right if you want an absolute dump truck wasn't it one gram of protein per pound of body weight per pound of lean body weight how are you supposed to know which body weight is lean uh calipers it's not a really dignified process um no thank you well yeah okay um Hey so uh so if I can promote something uh there is a a collab a very exciting collab coming on the podcast which is one of the reasons I'm traveling to Michigan next week where we will be going deep with a certain fella uh calls himself a doctor we'll find out what kind of doctor he really is but you might you may know him from YouTube and we're gonna find out all about protein quantity and protein timing and all that kind of stuff but anyways um yes you don't need that many essential amino acids in order to not die or get a nutritional disease but you do need a lot of protein if you want to be strong and active and all of that kind of stuff is that why there aren't too many vegan bodybuilders yeah probably there's there's maybe some maybe some right can I ask a fat soluble vitamin question sure okay so when they say like with your D vitamins you're supposed to take it with food yeah so that it absorbs what are we talking about here like a full meal can I just have like a little bite of something and take my D vitamin also keep in mind that I'm a child and I have gummy D vitamins oh gummies wow well the vegans aren't gonna like that no gelatin they're not vegan although actually well no there are you can get vegan vitamins that are made with um agar agar yes call me agar these are not these are not they these are delicious like candy so how much like can I have a snack can I have a bite of something do I need to eat them with a meal so I don't I don't know I know I know that there are supplement makers that I think do good evidence-based work in their field which is why I have worked with some of them in the past um who will give you like Vitamin D supplements that come in the form of pills that also have um omega-3 fatty acids in them which you need anyway and then that also facilitates the absorption of the vitamin D or like a tincture sometimes it'll you know it'll be sold as by companies that are not stupid and are actually thinking about bioavailability um so probably not a whole lot it definitely don't use this as an excuse to eat a whole basket of french fries right I guess what I'm asking is like if I snag a french fry off the kids plate and then eat my I would guess that's not quite enough okay all right but that's just a guess are you like a Snickers bar and then yes a Snickers bar will definitely do it yes what about a Fun Size Snickers bar I would guess a fun size Snicker would probably do it yes all right that I'm adding that to my daily vitamin that's right exactly probably a good time to emphasize for anyone who's new to the program that I am not a doctor a doctor or a scientist of any kind I am a nerd who eats and reads a lot anywho um so you know we talked I did a video recently about creatine supplementation and you know it's sort of this good thing if you're trying to be stronger it's there's really almost no downside to it for most people um and in researching that I discovered something that I that I did not know previously but it's very well documented which is that if you look at the blood the muscle creatine levels in in um non-meat eaters so that would include people who eat dairy by the way you're not going to get much creatine out of dairy so just vegetarians people don't eat animal flesh right if you look at the Creatine level in their muscle and compare it to a meat eater the difference between the meat eater and the non-meat eater is about the same as a creatine supplementer and a non-creatine supplementer who otherwise eats meat right which is to say it's not a huge difference but it's like it's a difference big enough to absolutely notice in the gym like when I first started supplementing creatine I was like holy crap I'm all of a sudden I'm like I'm 20 stronger like uh it's amazing you know um good I I also think that I probably responded to creatine more than the average person does and so it was just great for me right um so uh all of this is to say that like if you're a vegan then yes I think it might make sense to supplement creatine and protein also if you're trying to be stronger um in which case then yeah I kind of think you'll probably be on equal footing with a non-vegan and arguably better footing given that the the clear reconderance of the research is that saturated fat is way worse than you than unsaturated fat and most people get most of their saturated fat from meat vegans tend to eat less saturated fat unless you're you're just addicted to kind of like you know vegan replacements for non-vegan foods which are generally going to be based on like pollen kernel oil or coconut oil these like naturally saturated fats um you don't want to hit that stuff too hard because it's just as bad for you as the butter potentially worse you know according to you know some a little bit of research that's a topic for another day but anyways um so yeah I think you're you're in good footing for me I don't know should we do this is this too dangerous to talk about veganism and ethics now yes well let's let's dip our toes into it very gently okay did he ask about it obviously follows right no basking nutritionally and you answer nutritionally okay look here's what I'm going to say here's what I'm going to say okay um if you're going to be supplementing protein and you're a vegan I would encourage you to maybe think about even though you're a vegan drinking away protein some whey protein in addition to plant-based protein products that you might be hitting um for a couple of reasons one way is by far the most studied kind of protein supplement and so we kind of don't know how how good like pea protein is compared to whey because I mean there is some research but not a ton okay secondly if you're a vegan more in terms of thinking about it in terms of sustainability rather than Animal Welfare um you know I I don't know because there's no research on this at all but I would suspect that whey is more sustainable than plant-based protein supplements because the Whey is going to exist whether they sell it to you or not because the way is the byproduct of what industry Dairy yes the cheese industry right and they are going to make them they are going to make cheese whether you buy their way or not because she's gonna eat it okay like it's but the carbon footprint of growing all the things that make you know peas to make pea protein or whatever it is then yeah that's the water the tractors the all of that yes and as from what I can see looking at vegan protein powders which I've done I don't think many of them are some of them are using some byproduct from other Industries but mostly it's like it's you know that's like stuff that they're growing specifically to make the protein powder and no doubt its carbon footprint is much lower than the dairy Industries is but the dairy industry is gonna they're gonna make the cheese no matter what right it's gonna exist whether they sell it to you as a as a muscle building supplement or not and if they don't sell it to you as a muscle building supplement they're going to sell it to the to the livestock industry to incorporate an animal feed which is where I think most of that way goes anyway so I would consider hitting the way certainly it's been the case that like for me because like remember when I used to gym it way more seriously than I even do now and what would I eat Jim chicken Jim chicken yes which was this was like wave this way 15 years ago yeah this is back when we had no responsibilities and I went to the gym all the time and I looked way better than I do now uh disagree oh oh thank you honey um so I would do like what the bodybuilders all do which is like buy tons and tons of cheap chicken and just or fish and just cook up giant messes of disgusting animal protein and I was just I was a one-man chicken death squad right and that's and that's with me like being like you know natural not taking any you know steroids or anything like that and you know I I think about like a professional bodybuilder like you know how how many on steroids and how many chickens has big Ramy killed in his life right like wow so many chicken houses worth so many yes full chicken you see those chicken trucks on the interstate many many chicken tricks and we eat meat it's I I see no I see no for me fatal flaw uh fatal moral flaw in eating some animals but I think the scale at which we do it in order to produce chicken that's that cheap is inherently untenable from an animal welfare standpoint and it's like it's terrible for the environment like it's terrible thing about we all need to if you're gonna eat Me and You Gotta Eat way less of it that is the clear consensus opinion among experts who study food sustainability okay you're gonna find a YouTube video where a guy says oh no actually meat isn't bad for the environment but like who are you gonna believe you're gonna believe a guy who made a YouTube video are you gonna believe Harvard like guy who made a YouTube video well no I'm sorry they're just pointing out the irony well this is why I try to emphasize all the time that like I I this is why I I I I transparently defer to expertise all the time and people always you know people criticize me as saying it's a it's an appeals to Authority fallacy um but that's not true like it's just what it boils down to is that like if you are a leading if you are a leading scientific thinker on this topic like you are this is what you studied in school this is you are you are at the top of this field and it is your learned opinion that actually meat isn't as bad for the environment as soy or whatever then you have earned that opinion but if you haven't then you have no logical reason to believe that one Outsider outlier scientific opinion over and above the clear consensus of other scientists who say no that guy is dumb he's looking at the data wrong for everything that we know tells us that in fact Mead is way worse than soy for the environment okay really it's the the the the one Authority fallacy we we pay attention to the preponderance of authority the singular Authority wow is not it is that an astrological fallacy in that you learned about in school or did you just make that up I just said it dang no we're not gonna top that man I'm having a good day on this podcast yeah I think we gotta wrap it up because that's a high point okay all right well if you have any questions for a further episode uh you can send them to askadomquestions at gmail please send a video or audio file and do a little written description or summary of the question in the email if you don't do one of those things I probably won't even see it um and we'll will we see you next week I we'll see this was fun we'll see this was fun we will see how this performs on YouTube to be fair I'm here because Adam is working very very hard and so me being here so that's what I'm doing here um so helpful so we'll see we'll see how it goes um you know if you want to send an email saying hey we love Lauren you know keep her in the show Bring It you can do that um but if you want to say the opposite don't keep it to yourself keep it to yourself because here's the thing if you don't have anything nice to say don't don't say anything which is something that the internet has forgotten but the other thing is that it's like I'm gonna know if you don't like it I'm gonna see in the YouTube like metrics that you don't like it so you don't have to say anything and we'll response that I don't need to be here it's fine yes perfectly fine okay so um so thank you honey of course um we'll talk to you next time and uh you know make good choices,3

by Squarespace I've been developing recipes professionally almost four years now and I don't think I've come up with a better tip than starting your cookies under the broiler slash Grill it results in uncommonly pretty cookies with some caramelized flavor in the flaky top I've been trying to refine my old recipe lately and here it is with precise measurements this time a stick 113 grams unsalted butter just melt it down in the microwave you could Brown the butter some people who aren't me really like the taste of that but be aware that Browning also boils off the like 15 percent of butter that is water so you'll either need to add a little water or reduce the flour a bit 200 grams of sugar for granulated sugar that would be one cup but I'm using powdered sugar which makes for a slight Improvement in appearance you get a smoother surface on the cookie it doesn't make a huge difference don't go out of your way to find powdered sugar for this try brown sugar for flavor or drop in a little dab of molasses because brown sugar is just sugar Sugar Plus a little molasses give that a preliminary beating mostly to lower the temperature of the butter in case the butter is so hot that it's going to prematurely cook the egg beat the egg in if you're using granulated sugar you can get a similar effect to what I'm getting here by just beating for an extra couple of minutes at this stage let the sugar dissolve a bit in the water from the egg and the butter nice pudding like texture of that from the powdered sugar and from the fact that I didn't get my butter super hot if the butter was hotter the mixture would be runnier at this stage that doesn't really matter either way it's just a good cautionary note about judging the content of a dough by its consistency something I probably do a little too much I like a whole teaspoon of this kosher salt the kind of salt only matters in as much as different salts will measure out differently by volume 10 grams is what I like which is going to be noticeably salty you might like less you know I used to be an advocate for baking powder in these cookies but after I tested it I think I prefer simple baking soda in chewy cooking these at least for cakey cookies you want the baking powder which has an acid and a base baking soda is just the base half a teaspoon of that maybe three grams it's a subtle thing but baking soda just tastes a little better here acid does inhibit Browning everything in me is saying just slosh in some vanilla but I'm measuring it out for you let's say two teaspoons vanilla extract which is how much eight grams there you go you might like less Vanilla some people say I put in too much having tested it side by side I really do think these come out better with bread flour bread flour makes chewier cookies Browner cookies but all-purpose flour is okay this double zero flour is super finely ground which again gets you a nicer smoother top flower grind doesn't matter that much to this but it's nice and in all of my experiments I determined that the best quantity of flour relative to a stick of butter is 230 grams which is about a cup and a half of bread flour AP flour is lighter so it measures out differently mix that up nice and smooth honestly even going by weight has been a little hit and miss for me as far as getting the perfect cookie goes higher protein flour absorbs more water etc etc measuring by weight can lull you into a false sense of security the key here is to get enough flour that the dough is that sticky if it's not sticky at all you're going to get taller drier kind of scone-like cookies that's what would happen by the way if you boiled out all the water from the butter but did not lower the flour accordingly if it's way more sticky than this the cookies are going to spread super thin in the oven I find that if it feels just a little too sticky to me it's perfect and you could put in chocolate chips or whatever but today I'm putting in M M's just for funsies and a hundred grams is the right amount of any chocolate for me that's proportionally less chocolate than what the classic Toll House recipe calls for but Toll House is in the business of selling chocolate chips so what do you expect since the dough is a little sticky you can make it easier to shape by chilling it in the fridge for a bit make it more solid but based on my recent experiments the fridge makes no difference in how the cookies actually bake I usually bake cookies on parchment paper but the paper does burn a little with this method and that makes a nasty smell so I'm going bare pan today if you care that much about Precision 115 grams each is a good weight for half a dozen big cookies I just roll them out into golf balls first no non-stick spray on the pan by the way with these cookies at least the spray does almost nothing to inhibit sticking and it gives a slight fried flavor to the base that I don't like now I go back and flatten each ball into a little puck you can skip this but they bake prettier and more evenly if they start as pucks and if you really care about Aesthetics you can refine the circles a little bit before baking I've had my oven heating already to 375 fahrenheit 190 Celsius convection but I will immediately turn that off and turn the broiler on high what the Brits call a grill is up here at the top it heats up in a minute or two and if you don't have one just bake the cookies normally it's going to be fine under my Broiler this stage takes 90 seconds tops once you have golden brown domes that will crack in attractive patterns as the cookies spread get them out fast before they burn if you have multiple pans of cookies Brown them one at a time it'll go real fast now I'll turn the broiler off and the convection bake back on give the broiler a minute or two to cool down the oven itself is already at the right temperature because we preheated yes the word preheat has valid use cases and I just gave you one pet ants if you don't have a convection fan blowing in there you're going to be fine just maybe rotate the pans halfway through to help them bake more evenly conventional ovens have hot spots that the fan helps to even out and the fan accelerates baking a bit these only needed like eight more minutes for the texture I like I pull them when they look just a hair under baked and that is that so the broil then bake procedure that I invented accidentally one day when I turned on the broiler instead of the oven which I meant to turn on I think this replicates the look of a bake done in a Professional Steam injection oven the steam gels the outer starch layer and gets you that smooth effect that's just my guess let these cool and solidify before you try to scrape them off the pan if you just gotta have hot soft gooey cookies we'll bake them on parchment paper once cooled a bit these scrape off just fine with my thin silicone spatula and I've been eating cookies all day so Lauren is going to take this bite for me if the texture seems a bit too firm for you try them again in the morning they will soften unless you live in a desert with no humidity there you go in four years

Thanks to Dr. Carla Schwan, director of the National Center for...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.182271, when it comes to beef everybody worries about the same thing which is E coli bacteria when I was a kid I remember everybody here in the U.S freaking out about the Jack-in-the-Box outbreak Jack in the Box is kind of the less successful younger brother of McDonald's another fast food chain born of a mid-20th century Southern California Hamburger Stand in 1993 hundreds of customers in the Pacific Northwest got sick from E coli and four little kids died unimaginable for those families but as public health crises go this was really just a blip on the radar I mean that same year in the United States more than 1200 kids under 13 died in car crashes for example half as many American kids die in crashes these days because cars have gotten a lot safer has beef gotten safer since 1993 small as it was the Jack-in-the-Box outbreak really freaked people out and led to massive changes in the U.S food system that have been mirrored in other countries has it worked well that's a very hard question to answer certainly you don't seem to hear very often about people getting E coli compare it to norovirus the number one foodborne illness more than 5 million cases estimated every year here in the U.S and nearly a thousand deaths I've had norovirus I know tons of people who've had norovirus in contrast there's only about a quarter million estimated E coli cases a year in the U.S and about a hundred deaths that's a problem for sure but it was only the other day that for the first time in my life I actually met someone who had a real case of E coli it was years ago she was just a little kid when it happened coincidentally she grew up to be a food microbiologist here at the University of Georgia extension Dr Carla Schwann director of the national Center for home food preservation we just talked to her about pickling this is her lab this piece of equipment is called a stomacher it's exactly what it sounds like all the bacteria let's say if you have a letter us and you need to extract all the bacteria that might be present on the crevices of lettuce leafy vegetables also a major carrier of E coli lots of little crevices where bacteria can hide plus we usually eat them raw and what this machine does it's basically going to smack that simple very quickly once you're done you're going to have a very not appealing sample that has been smacked and all your bacteria are going to be hopefully in that that liquid Dr Schwann actually did her graduate research on E coli at Kansas State Poetic Justice considering E coli almost killed her when she was 12. rural Brazil 3 000 people is the total size of my my my home City and nobody knew what was going on so they took me to a bigger city they did a bunch of tests and they finally realized I had sugar tossing producing E coli Shiga toxin producing E coli that is key most Escher Ricky E coli bacteria are harmless they're probably in your gut right now actually helping they make vitamin K2 for you E coli are among the many gut microorganisms with which all warm-blooded animals have a mutualistic relationship that includes Birds who poop on crops and that's one of many reasons why E coli are found in pretty much any food that comes from a farm not just meat and that's not bad because we actually need bacteria in our bodies if you could use a few more beneficial microorganisms in your gut consider taking symbiotic plus from ritual sponsor of this video I've been taking ritual multivitamins and plant-based protein powders for years and now the three in one symbiotic a Prebiotic to support the growth and activity of beneficial gut bugs a probiotic consisting of said gut bugs Alive and Kicking and a postbiotic to fuel the cells that make up your gut lining three supplements in one and if you look it looks like a capsule within a capsule because it is it's delayed release to help the living payload survive your stomach and actually reach your colon it comes in a moisture control bottle that protects the bacteria without any need for refrigeration the capsules are minty not gross and easy to swallow like other ritual products it's free of animal products and major allergens gut health is a complicated topic and research is ongoing but there is actual reason to believe that the beneficial bacteria in here could help with gas and bloating mild and occasional diarrhea ritual is offering you 20 off your first month of synbiotic plus go to ritual.com Adam regusia20 use my code Adam ragusia 20 20 off your first month with my link and code in the description thank you ritual I want to emphasize now even more than I usually do that the ad is now over nothing else that anybody is saying in this video was paid for by anyone anyway most E coli strains are just fine some of them may be caused some and gastroenteritis or maybe a UTI in babies they can be a cause of bacterial meningitis that's more serious and then there's Shiga toxin producing E coli named after the Japanese bacteriologist kiyoshi Shiga in 1897 he discovered the bacteria that causes dysentery the genus shigella is therefore named after Dr Shiga as is the toxin they produce in 1977 Canadian researchers found the same toxin produced by a particular line of E coli then in 1982 the year I was born there was an outbreak Dateline Oak Brook Illinois corporate headquarters of McDonald's dozens of people who ate at McDonald's locations in Michigan and Oregon ended up in the hospital with severe diarrhea there is absolutely no basis of concern about the company's future performance read a corporate statement oh thank goodness I was so worried let's see here's a spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control because they ate at peak hours there may have been a large number of Frozen Patties on the grill and those patties may have reduced the heat of the grill below the proper temperature end quote soon after the CDC analyzed stool samples from some of the patients and they identified a rare Escher Ricky E coli serotype that's a strain or a particular family line within the species it makes the same family of toxins responsible for dysentery and by extension it's responsible for the deaths of Henry V and half of the other historical figures you've ever read about turns out a medieval Siege is not a great place to find clean drinking water maybe try not conquering other people's countries anyway this newly discovered deadlier E coli probably came to us from the guts of ruminants like cattle which are not bothered by the Shiga toxin therefore they make an excellent host for the bacteria it's actually bad for the bacteria if they kill their host or provoke a really strong immune response from the host so in that sense we humans were bad hosts to the Shiga toxin producing E coli a receptor in our intestines in our system that is called GB3 receptor and that's where it attaches and that's why we get sick on the other hand cattle which is the major reservoir of E coli they do not have that receptor but we do and Via that receptor the Shiga toxin is able to get into the cells particularly the cells in the lining of our smaller blood vessels and what's inside our cells the toxin inhibits protein synthesis and so the cells start to die our blood vessels Hemorrhage the worst case scenario it can shut down your kidneys so it produces a hemolytic ERM syndrome uromic syndrome so hus and when that happens a lot of times you die unfortunately and so I was able to survive so I'm here today but she was on dialysis for weeks just like 21 of the kids affected by the Jack-in-the-Box outbreak those are the immediate hazards of Shiga toxin then there are the lasting ones now my my microbiome is more limited and I don't have as much diversity because of that event and fast forward now you have an autoimmune disease that is in your gut again she has Crohn's disease and she can't say for sure if it was the E coli that caused it but it definitely could have so now you're probably thinking how does this happen how can I stop it from happening when I got sick with E coli I was traveling with my dad and my dad was an extension person as well back in Brazil and when I didn't have school he would take me with him to go to the different field days and all of that and so I would travel with him and I remember that day we shared a burger of course the burgers in Brazil are very different from the US they're very big you know they're full of stuff and we shared a burger he ate half and I ate half and he didn't get sick I got super sick hardly surprising it's always kids and old people people whose immune systems are not strong enough to fight off the infection E coli might have evolved the Shiga toxin to combat our immune response that usually kills them I mean like most events in evolutionary biology that's kind of a chicken and egg problem but it's definitely true that when people get the really bad E coli doctors will often not prescribe antibiotics when bacteria feel threatened they go in survival mode in part of the survival mode is producing the Toxin and that might make you sicker Dr Schwann got real sick regardless it's totally standard that the infection got the kid and not the adult and it's totally standard that it came from a burger cattle will have live E coli on their hides and in their digestive tracts if either of those come into contact with the muscle tissue during Slaughter well then the surface of the meat can be contaminated that does not stop Dr Schwann from eating rare steaks she does it all the time so do I a steak is different than ground beef because the steak you have the full muscle it is intact and so if you have bacteria that bacteria is going to be on the surface of the steak and when you are cooking that steak if you know even if it's like on the surface you are killing that bacteria that is on the surface it is not going to be inside down because it's an intact muscle ground beef is different because then now you're grinding that steak and you're introducing that bacteria that was on the surface to the inside yeah the outside is on the inside which is why I basically never risk a rare Burger it helps that I don't really like rare burgers in response to the Jack-in-the-Box outbreak the US government raised their recommended internal temperature Target for burgers it's now 160 fahrenheit 71c with carryover that should be more than enough to kill E coli and then there's all the regulations governing waste water and runoff from farms that's probably a big source of E coli contamination in non-meat Foods there's regulations for the slaughterhouses too so USDA regulates all of that and they do an amazing job at having regulations in places and inspectors on site on every single facility it's crazy a government inspector will literally go through all of the entrails kind of sift through the entrails it looks like they're trying to tell the future which I suppose in a way they kind of are because what they're looking for is any kind of perforation and he cut or prick that could have released the contents of the digestive system and contaminated the meat because if they find a little cut in the entrails they know the meat might be bad so they pull the meat off the line have these things made everybody safer well no one knows for sure every year there's an outbreak or two like this one linked to lettuce in 2019 but outside of those isolated events you're really only talking about a handful of actually documented cases and it's hard to draw statistically significant conclusions from such tiny numbers but maybe that itself is an indication of success still you know wash your veggies that you plan to eat raw cook your ground meat all the way through and generally try to avoid cross-contamination oh also it's a not recommended to eat raw flour anymore because there's an E coli risk there that that's one that we'll talk about another day,3
How to stop splatter in the kitchen,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ccCvThI7uVc/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLCe1i0PFW9-TDpvfTYm_q9KzaOKjw,ccCvThI7uVc,"7 minutes, 3 seconds","Thanks to ASUS and AMD for sponsoring this video!

#ASUS #ASUSAntibacterialGuard #VivobookS15...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.182271, this video is an ad for Asus and AMD hit my link in the description to check out the new Asus VivoBook S15 a super powerful laptop with the Asus antibacterial guard an antimicrobial silver ion coating perfect for dealing with germs in the kitchen speaking of which splatter we all deal with splatter in the kitchen and some of it is inevitable but there are a few strategies you can employ to reduce splatter considerably and that's good for both sanitation and safety first what even is the stuff that comes flying out of the pan and lands on the counter well most often it's oil or some other kind of liquid fat but don't blame the fat blame the water oil is merely the payload at the end of the rocket the water is the propellant I'ma show you there's a pasta dish I've seen people making all over the Internet it's based on super thin slices of zucchini fried in olive oil until Brown I'll get these sliced up and then season with salt and within minutes you're going to see how much water the salt draws out some olive oil in the pan heat until shimmering now I'll just take one of these paper thin slices drop it in the oil and watch messy dangerous explosion and what's exploding is the water the water hits the hot oil it expands rapidly into steam and that sudden explosion sends the surrounding oil flying out of the pan and onto the counter and that's if you're lucky it could also land on your skin and burn you or or it could hit the open flame on a gas stove and when enough oil droplets hit the flame at the same time well devotees remember when that explosion happened I did not stage it it happened because my food was wet let's try this again same salted zucchini slice but I will simply dry it first on a towel that oil is smoking hot I'll drop in the slice and look at the difference hardly a single droplet of oil is leaving that pan what a difference so that is the top tip for avoiding kitchen splatter dry off the food before it hits the hot oil dab it on a towel or maybe on a paper towel when you're dealing with something particularly germy like these meatballs speaking of germs let me show you my favorite feature of the Asus VivoBook S15 from Asus and AMD sponsor of this video this crazy powerful laptop has an antibacterial guard a coating of positively charged silver ions that penetrate the structure of bacteria bind with their cell membranes and stop them from reproducing I know I'm not the only person who rolls out meatballs one minutes and then jumps on the computer the next minute after a too short hand washing this is a recipe for cross contamination but remember the Asus antibacterial guard when they did their clinical tests on the coating ISO 22196 standard protocol testing they actually used E coli bacteria which is commonly found in beef of course they also use staphylococcus and they found that the antibacterial guard inhibits bacterial growth by more than 99 percent over a 24-hour period and other tests show that it's effective for a minimum of three years under regular use we can actually see the silver ion coating at work ourselves got some water on the track pad some water on the counter sprinkle some yeast onto each little pool let them bloom the next day both pools are dry I'll wet my finger to get some of the yeast off of the computer and mix it with some flour and water do the same with the yeast on the counter cover both samples and within minutes the yeast from the counter is fermenting in this flower you can see some Bubbles and it smells like bread the yeast from the computer show no signs of fermentation no bubbles no yeasty smell no signs of Life the laptop with the latest Asus hygiene technology makes it powerfully antimicrobial and it's a great computer it's thin and light check this out it goes all the way down love that it's got the AMD ryzen 9 6900 HX CPU if it's powerful enough to edit this High frame rate footage of the zucchini test then it's definitely powerful enough for hardcore gaming or whatever and speaking of that zucchini test let's talk about what else you can do to minimize splatter absolutely get stuff dry before it goes in the hot oil that's going to keep you out of most trouble but eventually water from inside the food starts to surface as you can see in these meatballs and we're going to get some steam explosions again for some reason I have like a mental block about using Lids on frying pans it just never really occurs to me but they make lids for frying pans for a reason sometimes it's a simple as plopping a lid down you just have to be aware that you're trapping more than just oil droplets you're trapping steam this is going to turn the pan into a steamer all that trapped water could make Browning a little bit harder plus steam will cook the whole body of the meatball faster the insides might end up overcooked by the time the outsides are browned so what you really want is one of these a splatter guard it's basically a flat wire sieve place it over the pan and steam can escape but oil droplets get trapped in the wire great the key in my opinion is to buy one that is flat no offset handle why because a flat one takes up hardly any space in the dishwasher and you definitely want to wash it in the dishwasher it's quite hard to clean in the sink time to deglaze this pan but here's another tip don't drizzle if I pour just a little bit of wine it hits the hot oil and it explodes but if I'm bold and I pour a lot of wine all at once there simply is not enough energy in the pan to to vaporize all of that liquid so no explosions dump in the canned tomatoes simmer for a few hours and when the sauce gets really thick then you might start to see some sauce splatter which is different from oil splatter the fix here is to Simply turn the heat down because if the sauce is splattering that means the heat is high enough to burn the sauce that's at the bottom of the pan right on the Pan's surface in which case splatter is really the least of your problems either turn the heat down or stir more frequently just to keep the heat and steam from building up on that bottom layer let's see how this meatball footage looks on my new Asus laptop gorgeous deep Reds beautiful colors on that monitor and again my AMD ryzen 6000 series processor has no trouble chugging on that footage trust me video editing is one of the toughest tests you can throw at a processor it can boost up to a TDP thermal design power of 45 Watts lots of

sponsored by Squarespace it's a retro mid-century mom classic for sure but a classic for a reason if you need a whole lot of hearty food that you don't have to fuss over you can't go wrong with a tuna noodle casserole and honestly you could skip the tuna this particular recipe is distantly descended from a Martha Stewart recipe my wife was trying one day and we were like wait this is not gonna taste like anything so we started jazzing it up and I'm doing it as a one pan meal a big stove safe baking dish or any big oven safe pan a whole stick of butter 113 grams or you could use like half a cup of olive oil 120 mils I'm just melting that over moderate heat maybe give it a little help so that the melted part doesn't burn before the rest is liquefied now I'll whisk in half a cup of all-purpose flour 60 grams to make a roux might seem like too much flour at first but a rule loosens up as it Cooks I don't know why whisk it smooth and then keep whisking as it cooks for a couple of minutes just to get get the raw flour taste out and maybe develop a few little nutty flavor notes I see it just starting to turn brown it smells cooked that's enough time to start whisking in a whole quart of milk which is just over a liter a little bit at a time especially early on when we're whisking out the lumps you could use any non-dairy milk you could use some Veggie stock plain water it'd be fine yes I'm showing you this entire assembly in one shot so you can see how dead simple this recipe is if you were to dump the liquid in all at once you would lose the viscosity that you need to whisk the lumps out the lumps would just Bob around in a pool of milk once you've got the lumps out you can pour in a lot more aggressively the wheat starch will gelatinize and thicken as that comes up to a simmer and we will have bechamel sauce now green beans you always want to snip off the stem end the stem is totally unchewable but I leave the flower end that doesn't bother me I'm going to grab a handful of green beans at a time hold on let me stir the sauce it's so thick the bottom layer can burn let's turn the heat all the way down we just need a bare simmer anyway green beans in parallel alignment and I will cut them into chunks at an extreme angle makes them look a little prettier I'm doing a whole pound of green beans 454 grams some classic casseroles are based on green beans instead of noodles I'm basically doing half noodles half green beans which should result in a nutritionally superior product for me those need a little head start to a little pre-cooking so I'll stir them in and let them simmer that sauce looks way too thick now but tons of water is going to come out of the vegetables I've got this mostly sweet red pepper from the garden I'll cut that in half take the seeds out and slice it into strips you could use a regular bell pepper instead in those go and you could use a second bell pepper as Martha does but I'm using a handful of red chilies I think these are Fresnos which are not very hot but if you want to control the heat somewhat more one thing you can do is slice them into rounds pick them up and then just push out the seeds and the ribs where most of the heat is you'll only have to do the that with the slices from up near the stem the other rounds will be empty gather those up and then you can kind of shake out some more seeds throw those in stir in the peppers so they can get a little head start on softening I'll get rid of all those seeds now I've got a couple of Bunches of green onions here but any form of onion will work as long as you slice it thin I'll peel off any tattered or slimy outer layers some of these are noticeably Sandy on the inside that'll happen they grew up through dirt yet another reason to peel off those outer layers I'll give those one more rinse in the sink okay cut the roots off and discard then slice thin all the way up through the whites and into the greens I'll just stop when I get to the very top where they're super dry and stringy all those go in stir stir make sure the sauce at the bottom isn't burning here's a great trick that I do owe to Martha canned marinated artichokes usually they're baby artichokes which is why you can eat the whole thing not just the heart these bring a ton of flavor to a casserole if you can get the lid off I'm embarrassing myself oh you know our friends at the national Center for home food preservation gave me one of these thingies for gripping Lids nice Martha says to drain the marinade off I see no reason to not just dump it all in there now it's tuna time I've got four of these standard five ounce cans 140 grams each and this is one of the brands that's generally recommended by the folks at seafoodwatch.org they also recommend looking for cans that say pole and lime cot there's lots of terrible sustainability issues associated with tuna and seafood watch has a great guide for canned tuna it's linked in the description I'll dump all of these in again I see no reason to drain them we need liquid we need flavor put it all in if you don't eat fish maybe some jars of marinated mushrooms instead once the tuna is in you don't want to over stir because you could end up shredding the meat too fine I'll put in some seasonings before I stir again a ton of garlic powder makes a casserole really taste like something a little less onion powder a little dried thyme or other herb maybe some mustard powder grind in a lot of black pepper and then a big pinch of salt to start with we'll probably need more but the tuna is salty the artichokes are salty so it's good to be conservative give that an initial stirring and now it's time for 12 ounces 340 grams of dried egg noodles manischevitz is the best hashtag not an ad and lots of people pre-boil them but you can just dump them right in I'll stir them in we've got some excessively large chunks of tuna still but they will keep breaking apart as we stir here's the trick to making baked noodle dishes without pre-boiling get it so that the texture looks right except for the fact that the noodles are dry this is about the sauce texture that I want in the end get everything tossed in enough thick sauce and then top it off with enough wine or stock or plain water to just cover all of that will get absorbed by the noodles yes I'm doing a whole bottle of cheap Pinot Grigio you could use half Wine Half water if you want it less acidic you could use all water but with a big glug or two 2 of white balsamic vinegar to replicate the taste of wine without the alcohol just get enough watery liquid in there to barely cover I need a little more so a little water stir stir now I'll get a spoonful of that liquid and taste for seasoning tastes pretty good by itself but it's going to need more salt a lot more because all of the flavor is going to be diluted by the noodles and the other Bland bulk in there the sauce should taste too salty at this stage a little too salty push all those noodles down so they get cooked and lastly you can grate on any hard cheese if you want this is pecorino this will Brown nicely in the last phase of cooking and that's it cover tightly with foil to trap Steam and get all the noodles cooked Bake at 400 degrees Fahrenheit 200 Celsius until the noodles are soft and it seems like most of the water is absorbed it'll be 45 minutes an hour max then throw it back in uncovered to evaporate any remaining free water and to let the top get all brown and crunchy another other 20 minutes or so yeah it takes a long time to bake especially if you don't boil the noodles first but you can bake it the night before and just reheat it when you get home from work or you can kind of under bake it a little bit and then freeze it there's a reason everybody brings casseroles to people who are sick or they just had a baby or something casseroles tend to taste even better after they've been reheated a meal as simple and all

or lime juice for a real long time as long as you get the pH below the magic number of 4.6 you're going to have pickles but some people would argue that those are not true pickles no no no they would say that true pickles are preserved by an acid created by the bacteria inside the food itself lactic acid that's what lacto fermentation is it's a pretty magical process that yields some of the most delicious foods humans have ever come up with it was one of the only ways people had to preserve vegetables until refrigeration and when it comes to us modern people there are scientists who believe we would be healthier our guts would be healthier if we ate more of these lacto-fermented Foods again even though we don't really have to anymore because you know we have the fridge that said it can be a little scary eating a wet thing that you just left at room temperature for a few weeks how do you pickle safely and how big are the risks well field trip to the University of Georgia extension where food microbiologist Dr Carla Schwann directs the national Center for home food preservation when you look at the microflora the indigenous Flora in a cucumber for example or you know cabbage if you're doing sauerkraut there is around 10 million cells of indigenous bacteria that are not lactic acid bacteria so E coli coliforms cholesteria yeah you heard that right lots of bad bugs inside vegetables usually not enough to make a healthy person sick which is why we can eat raw vegetables though with these cucumbers you got to make sure to knock off those little trichomes very very sharp of those are and for pickling cucumbers you want to cut off the flower end not the stem end but the end where the flower used to be why Always remove the flower end because you can have certain fungi that are present and they have enzymes that basically break down pectin plus the flour itself makes some of these enzymes that could make the pickles kind of soft and slimy so that's not good that's why we cut off the flower end there's not a ton of bad bacteria in most veggies but what matters is the proportion you got millions of bad bacteria in contrast to maybe just a thousand or a few thousand of the good bacteria that we want lactate acid producing bacteria there's only a few of them relative to the bad ones so we've got to give them an advantage we select the good bacteria and we suppress the the bad bacteria that are present there so how do we do that we utilize salt the trick is how much salt if you completely pack food in salt you will kill everything salt draws the water out of cells bacteria shrivel up and die you preserve the food basically forever which people have been doing for thousands of years that may be how some of them accidentally invented lacto fermentation maybe somebody was trying to Salt cure their food but they didn't have quite enough salt that day and they did not put on enough salt to kill all microorganisms it was just enough salt to kill the bad ones lactic acid producing bacteria are able to tolerate some salt how depends on the species but here's one example some lactic acid bacteria are able to absorb compounds from their environment that balance out the osmotic pressure of the salt water around them like the amino acid Proline for example they suck it into their cytoplasm it doesn't hurt them in there the way that salt wood and yet it is able to balance out the osmotic pressure of the salt that's outside of the cell it's like two people leaning on the same swinging door from both sides the door stays shut and the water doesn't leak out of the cell so the sweet spot where bad bacteria die and good bacteria Thrive is between two and two and a half percent salt by weight for pickled cabbage that's really easy to figure you just weigh out your cut cabbage figure out what 2.5 percent of that is and sprinkle on that much sodium chloride it's the weight of the salt not the weight of sodium specifically in the case of European style pickled cabbage sauerkraut this is basically it you let the Cabbage sit for a while maybe mash it up a little to draw out the natural water inside the Cabbage I love sauerkraut and kimchi but at this stage it really does smell like farts you know what smells nicer body wash from native sponsor of this video look at these gorgeous scents I'm posh special to Citrus and herbal musk but today I'ma try sea salt and Cedar smells like the beach minus the rotting seaweed note of course check that luxurious and foamy lather despite the fact that native body wash is sulfate free my skin feels great with this stuff it's also phthalate free dye free vegan and cruelty free and I appreciate that the scents are subtle and tasteful whether you want to smell like spicy and woodsy or like clean and crisp native has options for you for the fall check out the cabin collection cozy scents like warm cider and cinnamon and remember native mix deodorant and toothpaste too I use native deodorant every day in the plastic free container three body washes are normally 27 but if you use my link and code regusia 5 you'll get them for 17 that's 40 off with my link and code in the description limited time offer thank you native anyway cabbage is really easy to ferment because enough water comes out of the Cabbage when you salt it that you can keep everything submerged below the salt water the brine which you have to do you have to create an anaerobic environment for the food if it's exposed to air you're going to get some bad bugs especially fungi on the other hand you cannot seal this up tight either I know this looks and feels like we are canning but we are not canning canning is a totally different thing that requires using heat to sterilize everything among other steps and you can't really do that with fermentation because you'd kill the bacteria that you need to ferment your food and make lactic acid canning also requires totally airtight seals but we can't do that in fermentation either no no yeah you're not going to seal in the Mason jar because you have production off CO2 and that could potentially explode so you don't want that right so some people do ferment pickles in just a loose fitting mason jar to let the gas Escape but Dr Schwann says that's not really a best practice like here's my Kraut after it's been fermenting about six weeks and you can see the dry cavities that have developed fungus and other bad stuff could grow in there where there's air so what you really want is a weight that will push all of the solids down below the brine as they shrivel there are pickling weights you can buy they're usually ceramic which is both heavy and chemically non-reactive I should have done that this Crouch smells great but it's probably a little risky I don't think I'm gonna eat it let's do better with the Cucumbers whole cucumbers are a little bit trickier to pickle because not enough water is going to come out of them to keep everything submerged so you're gonna have to use some water add some water to get enough Brine and you have to factor that water into your calculations we need the total contents of this pot to be between two and two and a half percent salt by weight not just the water so I either need to weigh the cucumbers with the water and then figure out 2.5 percent of that or I can just follow a Time tested volume based recipe like the ones provided by Dr Schwan's National Center for home food preservation they have a book that you can buy but they have tons of recipes for free on their website tested and trusted by scientists I'm following their recipe for dill pickles fine sea salt it dissolves readily and it has no additives like iodine or anti-caking agents that could Cloud the Brine and then this is weird a little bit of vinegar I thought the whole point of lacto pickles was no vinegar well Dr Schwann says that like commercial dill pickle makers usually use a lot more salt maybe up to five percent salt that's a little bit more reliable there's definitely no way that any bad bugs could survive an environment that salty the problem is that the pickles are then like inedibly salty so what they do after they ferment them is they put them into pure fresh water to purge the salt out of them we're probably not going to do that at home so for us that little bit of vinegar is just an insurance policy it controls the bad bugs before the lactic acid bacteria can get established and start making their own acid dill pickles have Dill duh maybe some spice and then a whole lot of garlic that's what makes a New York Jewish deli style pickle to me some people use food grade lime it gets you crispy pickles but people say that tannins in black tea leaves have a similar effect no idea if that's actually true lay in the Cucumbers they really can't be any bigger than that or they'll take too long to pickle and you can see that they're floating we need to wave them down with something to keep them in that anaerobic environment metal would react with the acid glass is chemically inert and it'll provide a window through which we can watch into the basement closet with you normal room temperature is generally the best for lacto fermentation and we'll see you in a few weeks time lapse in the first week or so enzymes break down the chlorophyll anyone can see that but a trained eye like Dr Schwans sees something else those small bubbles I don't know if you can see here could be gas escaping from inside the Cucumber cells but it could also be CO2 which might be created by our first string good bacteria low kind of stock messengeroids yeah what she said that species or a similar one will dominate for the first week making CO2 and lactic acid when that is happening you also see let's say you have coliforms present you also see the coliforms dying coliforms would be bad things like E coli bad soil bacteria those first good ones can only handle a little acid so once the environment gets to like one percent lactic acid they shut down and some more acid tolerant species take over like lactobacillus brevis and lactobacillus plantarum they go about eating the sugar in the Cucumbers yes there's a little bit of sugar in a cucumber they create lactic acid as a waste product eventually driving the pH in there below 4.6 which is crucial you might be wondering why Dr Schwann is plotting a downward trajectory to describe Rising acid concentration it's because as acid goes up pH goes down and we got to get that pH below 4.6 closer to do matulina will not grow below 4.6 and so if your pH is above 4.6 you have to be worried about clostridium and you know that clusterian botulin produces a neurotoxin that causes botulism I would definitely other one to have that there's also other pathogens that will survive and will grow at higher pH so you're talking about listeria talk about E coli salmonella so it's it's a whole gang of bacteria um that could be a present if you stop the fermentation too early that said for many years New York Jewish delis have sold these things they call half sours which is a pickle they take out before it's completed its fermentation process so it's not so sour and it's a little bit more crisp and green and nobody's gotten botulism from those as far as I can tell no case reports that I can find crucially though those delis put them into the refrigerator and refrigerator would also slow the growth of the botulism bacteria that's really really important back in the day they didn't have refrigeration so they had to keep fermenting until the pickles are really sour somewhere between a pH of three and four is where the good bacteria can't take it anymore they shut down and your pickles are done as they're ever going to be they should smell sour they should taste sour at this point it's safest to either can them or transfer them to the fridge because bad things could happen wait for it wait for it and mold giant mold Bloom about six weeks in spores could have floated in on the air or they could have been on my spices mold or other fungus can grow on any of the surface that's exposed to air you're supposed to skim it off as soon as you see it but I didn't want to mess up the time lapse and as a result things got really out of hand now lots of the fungal growth is going to be harmless things like yeast and Dr Schwann says even dangerous fungi generally will not create mycotoxins in salty conditions but only if you skim frequently you don't want to have that you know different layers of mold because that top layer of mold could be producing mycotoxin and you know it's not in contact with the brine or anything and yeah I would not eat that if you had to remove it over time consistently then yes um but like this after eight weeks definitely not yeah I'm just gonna have a teeny tiny little bite tastes great what a shame here's what Dr Schwann likes to use as a weight a sealed plastic bag full of 2.5 percent brine it conforms to the Bowl fully covering the surface though gas can still get out and if the bag leaks no problem because it's filled with Brine and not plain water that would dilute the brine if you do that and you follow a time-tested recipe like the ones they have from the national Center for home food preservation that's going to keep you out of trouble Dr Schwann is aware of no documented case in which someone has gotten sick from properly lacto-fermented vegetables meat sure but not vegetables and I've been combing the literature I can't find anything I've talked to other food microbiologists they don't know of any cases it's just not a thing that seems to happen these pickles are really safe as long as you do everything basically right use your senses though if the pickles smell like they're rotting if they don't smell or taste sour well that's an indication that your good bacteria lost the battle against the bad ones but follow the recipe and that just probably won't happen what's more likely to happen is that all of these live beneficial bacteria and their metabolites will end up in your gut where they will improve your gut health and that's a really complicated topic that we'll talk about more another day but that is real science there has been some studies showing that I think if you consume 120 grams of kimchi I think it was the study I saw a day you're going to have health benefits and I was trying to do that for a while and it's a lot of kimchi I wasn't able to keep up but yeah in South Korea that's the average and of course kimchi is basically sauerkraut with a lot more interesting flavors delicious but it's all thanks to those lactic acid bacteria that have co-evolved with us humans for Millennia and long may we mutually benefit each other,3

podcast episode 29 today a deep dive on why tap water sometimes tastes really bad especially at the beach but first who will defend the poor Spud I know that we've moved past a society past the complete demonization of carbohydrates which is good um people have a tendency to really hate on the white potato and I don't understand why I mean one they're delicious but also it's a dang dang vegetable like it's not a Twinkie but it often gets one to the same category as like the other simple carbs um you know like white flour and white bread and I don't know macaroni and cheese um but I don't mean there's gotta be some like redeeming qualities in a potato it is an edible plant after all aren't we supposed to all be eating more plants thank you Kim from Louisville nice to see you again potatoes absolutely are full of starch and starch is very easily broken down by your body into glucose which you rapidly absorb into your bloodstream thus spiking your blood sugar which is a problem for most people these days living in rich countries at least I do think there is legitimate reason to be wary of too many potatoes in the modern developed World diet especially the way we usually eat potatoes which is generally deep fried or otherwise highly processed and fattened up however there are certainly far worse things to eat than fresh potatoes and historically speaking potatoes are almost the perfect food white potatoes are shockingly nutritious in terms of vitamins and minerals and such not just in terms of their carbs white potatoes are arguably more nutritious than their very distant cousins the sweet potatoes and historically speaking Humanity owes a huge debt to white potatoes whenever potatoes have failed us it was usually because we failed the potatoes so now you be the judge you be the jury I will be the lawyer representing potatoes my client the potato is a Nightshade like the tomato and like a tomato it grows fruits Google image search potato fruits and you will see these little clusters of tiny Green Tomato looking fruits berries they may even eventually turn kind of orange when ripe or they may turn like a dark purple and look like cherries when they're ripe but uh you know cut a potato fruit open they look exactly like cherry tomatoes on the inside just don't eat them they are super toxic potato berries are they're filled with solanine the bitter alkaloid that likely evolved in these plants as an insect repellent if you see a green potato that's a potato that was exposed to too much light and air prompting it to produce solanine to protect itself from insects the potato is basically saying oh crap I've grown above ground now bugs can get me I've got to grow some solanine to kill them a very green potato can absolutely make you very sick though that probably wouldn't happen because it would taste bitter and you would stop eating it unless you were starving and that's a thing that happens in Starvation situations where people end up eating green potatoes and and dying from them the fruits the berries of potato plants are always super toxic according to every Botanical reference that I can consult you usually don't see potato fruits on the plants though unless you get an unusually cool summer because In the Heat of the summer the flowers will just drop right off the plant as soon as they bloom before they can ever be pollinated and if they're not pollinated you don't get the fruits so you usually don't get the fruits unless you have like a weirdly cool July and nobody makes an effort to grow potato fruits because they are only good for getting potato seeds and potato seeds are only good for doing like high level breeding or research work on potatoes you would not want to grow potato plants from seeds if you did it would take several years before the plant produced tubers underground of any remotely edible or delicious size potatoes are perennials the above ground part dies back every winter but the plant lives it stores energy underground in its root system in the form of a big swollen root called a tuber that's the potato that you eat if you just leave it in the ground instead of harvesting it and eating it new stems will shoot up out of the little eyes in the potato in the springtime and the plant will repeat the cycle if you grow a potato from seed it takes several annual cycles for it to accumulate enough energy via photosynthesis to fill up a big starchy delicious tuber or two or three or four or five get a lot of potatoes from a good potato plant another reason nobody grows potatoes from seeds is because potatoes can't self-pollinate they can only pollinate each other and sexual reproduction like that will introduce a lot of genetic mutation from generation to generation that is the whole point of sexual reproduction and one of them uh and uh it's bad if you have potatoes that you like and you basically just want to replicate those potatoes rather than having them mutate into something else if you just want to replicate the potato you have sexual reproduction is bad you don't want to be developing a new breed you like the breed you have luckily there is a way to reproduce the potato that you want more of and that is to not eat all of the tubers save some of them as seed potatoes you put them right back into the ground they grow a clone of the previous potato plant actually arguably it's the same plant the plant is immortal you just cut off parts of it and they keep growing it's like growing any other plants from a clipping you get a and basically identical plant genetically you can even take the tuber cut it into multiple pieces and as long as each of those pieces has an eye on it each will grow into a new plant and you'll get a ton of tubers from each one that you can dig up and eat and just save a few of them to replant for next year some of the most fun you can have gardening is to plant potatoes because digging them up is like a treasure hunt and there's usually a lot of treasure potatoes are incredibly productive modern potatoes with modern farming produce about 18 million calories per acre compare that to wheat modern wheat modern farming it's 6 million calories per acre 18 with potatoes six with wheat every ancient proto-agricultural civilization in the world coalesced around grains as their staple crop wheat rice barley except in the Americas I mean Maize corn that's a grain and it was the staple of ancient Mesoamerican civilizations but American civilization did not begin in mesoamerica it began in South America where the potato was first domesticated wild potatoes grew and still grow all over South and Central America and up into the the Southern United States where I am scientists used to think that like multiple far-flung indigenous American people domesticated wild potatoes independently but then in 2005 a U.S department of Agriculture botanist working at University of Wisconsin named David Spooner made the case and apparently convinced all of his colleagues that all domestic potato varieties have one single origin seven thousand years ago on the shores of Lake Titicaca high up in the Andes mountains on the border of modern day Peru and Bolivia that's where they all come from the domesticated ones potatoes are easy to grow they grow in all kinds of climates as long as you replant seed potatoes rather than waiting for the actual potato seeds and they're incredibly productive far more productive than grains on a calorie to acre basis that's particularly important around the Andes where there isn't a lot of like flat Farmland available the problem with potatoes as a staple crop is that they are wet they're filled with water which makes them heavy to carry around with your nomadic hunter-gatherer tribe or with your Army on campaign also potatoes because they're filled with water it generally only lasts a matter of months if properly stored somewhere dark and dry whereas properly dried and stored grains can last years the Incan civilization up in the Andes much later civilization but the Incan civilization they eventually fixed this problem with potatoes by developing chunyo the staple food of their empire chunyo is freeze-dried potatoes they didn't have enough hot sun up in the Andes to dry corn but they could in the right months of the year freeze dry potatoes you leave them out you let them freeze overnight and then they thaw in the hot sun the next day this damages their cells that freeze thaw cycle it damages their cells liberating cytoplasm liberating water which then evaporates in the Sun during the day you do this across five consecutive nights with the right weather and you've got yourself freeze-dried potatoes chunyo grind it into flour boil the flour into a porridge when you're ready to eat Incas built their empire on chunyo though interestingly the dominant modern potato species solenum tuberosum tuberosum is not from the Andes it's from the islands off the coast of Chile way way way way way way way down south from Peru somebody brought the original domesticated potatoes from up there around Lake Titicaca somebody took that all the way down to those islands off the coast of Chile and where they crossbred them intentionally or not with local wild potatoes on those islands and now we have solanum tuberosum tuberosum from which most modern potato cultivars are derived just speaks to how that Western spine of South America was a real like super highway of ideas and Technologies and cultures and people in the ancient world that narrow strip of Coast between the Andes and the Pacific I've never been to South America I really really want to see Peru and Chile and Southern Argentina Terra del Fuego one day I'll get there anyway potatoes were an awesome staple crop for ancient people for all the reasons discussed the chief Botanical function of the potato is to store energy calories through the winter and so they help you to do that as well the potato is mostly water but after that it's mostly starch which is just sugar stacked up into long lines or branches that are difficult for microorganisms to digest that's probably the main reason why plants evolved to store their sugar in the form of starch but you and I we can digest starch very easily especially amylopectin which is the branched form of starch most starch in potatoes is amylopectin which our digestive enzymes have absolutely no trouble breaking down into individual glucose molecules really fast eating cooked starch is basically like eating sugar to a human in terms of its effect on your blood sugar and for most of human history that was great because most humans needed as many raw and ready calories as they could get their hands on The Conquistadors knew a good thing when they saw it and weren't afraid to steal it they brought back potatoes to Europe with them potatoes became a staple crop all over Eurasia particularly in Eastern Europe and of course the anglo-celtic Isles of course Ireland if you have poor soil and not that much of it potatoes are great they weren't that popular in Ireland until the turn of the 19th century and it became the staple food there chiefly because mostly English landlords were increasingly taking all of the other food to feed the Napoleonic Wars and also the Brits liked beef they wanted more and more beef and more and more acres in Ireland that had previously been dedicated to farming grains became cattle pasture the Irish only had a few Acres left to grow food for themselves and so potatoes 18 million calories per acre right the Potato Famine in Ireland was probably a political problem more than it was an agricultural problem but there was a real agricultural problem there and that is lack of genetic diversity potatoes aren't from around there Europeans brought only a few kinds of potatoes back with them from the Americas and they they didn't change very much genetically once they got to Europe because people generally don't reproduce potatoes sexually they plant seed potatoes and Seed Potatoes get you clones so very little genetic diversity when a blight showed up that killed potato plants it killed them all because they were all equally susceptible because they were all clones of each other but that's not the potato's fault that's our fault nor is it the potatoes fault that most people in Ireland and every other highly developed country these days have access to way too many calories way too many quickly digested carbs most of us don't need all that starch but we need fiber and potatoes have a fair bit of fiber if you eat the skin which is one of the many reasons I usually don't peel potatoes we need potassium potatoes are excellent sources of potassium and vitamin B6 and vitamin C believe it or not if you only ate potatoes you would not get scurvy assuming you ate enough potatoes you could also get all of your essential amino acids your protein from eating a lot of potatoes and white potatoes have twice as much protein than sweet potatoes it's still not a lot of protein especially if you're like trying to get lean inject but it's probably enough protein to survive on if you get enough potatoes if you only lived on potatoes eventually you would run into Calcium deficiency and vitamin A deficiency or sweet potatoes have a ton of vitamin A that's that's why they're orange so if you complemented your white potatoes with sweet potatoes that would get you pretty far you probably wouldn't get all your essential fatty acids from potatoes and lots of other B vitamins that you need you can't live on just white potatoes for very long but you could live on mostly white potatoes forever and look healthy or not the bottom line is potatoes are one of the few foods that are still affordable even as inflation has made food around the world 11 more expensive this year but I've been talking about a sponsor of this show for the past few weeks a great way for us to lessen the sting of inflation on our bank accounts potentially take home a little something extra it's called Masterworks sponsor of this episode they let you invest in multi-million dollar works of art from legendary artists like Picasso Basquiat Banksy these are not nfts it's real art the team at Masterworks they've got a team of world-class analysts using proprietary data compiled from millions of auction records to Source art with the greatest potential appreciation then they divide those paintings into shares so that you can invest without needing millions of dollars after that they wait for the most opportune time to sell all to get you the best results like an exit for a 21.5 percent net return just three weeks ago at the start of October how did they manage such impressive results even as inflation rages and the stock market spirals downward well the Contemporary Art Market is remarkably stable and relatively independent of stocks and bonds with a correlation of less than 0.3 to other major asset classes that's why in Morgan Stanley's most recent report on the Art Market they report the average piece is selling for 26 percent more at auction compared to last year it's a lack of correlation in action the S P 500 is down around 22 percent but art is up 26 percent no wonder in October of last year Masterworks raised 110 million dollars in their first fundraising round that makes them a startup unicorn valued over a billion dollars now Masterworks has sold seven paintings to date and the most recent one they just sold even since my video on them last month it was a George condo Masterpiece that brought in an incredible 21.5 percent net return to their investors that means if you would put in fifteen thousand dollars you'd walk away with more than eighteen thousand dollars with results like that it's no surprise Masterworks has a wait list but you can skip it by clicking my link in the description check it out see if it's the right investment option for you past performance is no guarantee of future results thank you Masterworks hey Adam I originally went to the beach and why is speech water so gross all up and down the East Coast at least and even when you cool it down it tastes gross and I feel like the most weird thing to me is that it feels like thick like viscous in my mouth uh I'm basically just packing seltzers every time I go to the beach right now it'd sort of be nice to solve this mystery thanks so just to clarify Sam is not talking about drinking seawater at the beach he's talking about drinking the tap water supplied by Beach adjacent communities municipal water flowing through the pipes that you drink from the sink in your hotel or wherever that you're staying at at the beach such water does indeed tend to taste terrible because of sulfur I imagine that we all like to imagine that our tap water comes from some pure cold running Mountain stream like up in the volcanic hills around Rome you imagine this pure Mountain Water rushing down the aqua apia or one of those other gorgeous Stone Roman aqueducts into the hearts of your city or we like to imagine that our tap water comes from some kind of high-tech purification facility where everything is quadruple filtered and reverse osmosified or whatever but neither of these ideals is generally accurate I mean sometimes it's accurate New York City is not historically a model of great Municipal hygiene maybe it is now because of how insanely Rich it has become at least in Manhattan parts of Brooklyn but when I was growing up in Pennsylvania and driving into New York all the time the smell of that city was hot garbage literally hot garbage half the year hot garbage NP is what I remember of New York City as a child the David Dinkins years and the early Giuliani years back when your parents would coach you on not making eye contact and walking with intentions so that you don't get mugged walking around Midtown Manhattan a notion that is kind of laughable today I mean I'm sure people still get mugged there today sometimes but like it used to be really common like I knew I knew lots of people personally who had been mugged in the city and then the Global Financial class fell upon Manhattan like a giant bag of gold doubloons and crushed everything good and bad under there incalculable weight I assume it's evident to everybody at this point that Rudy Giuliani is no genius Giuliani did not transform New York it was the Global Financial class anyway NYC not historically a model of hygiene but they have legit pure Mountain Water delicious delicious pure Mountain Water from a system of reservoirs and a few natural lakes up in the Catskill Mountains and down through the Hudson River Valley legit beautiful places I love Upstate New York I would not want to live there again my one winter in Rochester nearly killed me literally but Rochester is really the Midwest that's the flat industrial western side of New York State people generally say the Midwest region begins at Ohio but I have long argued that like Western New York and western Pennsylvania are far more Midwestern in landscape and culture and in their economies than they are Northeastern or Mid-Atlantic Pittsburgh is really a Midwestern City culturally Buffalo is a Midwestern City Rochester Erie PA all of those industrial cities on the Lakes those feel super Midwestern to me not Northeastern way more like Chicago than like New York and they tend to have bad tap water which is weird given that the Great Lakes constitute the world's largest surface freshwater system twenty percent of the Earth's surface fresh water is in the North American Great Lakes and yet tap water in Cleveland is super expensive and not that great I mean it's fine it's safe but tap water in the Great Lakes is notoriously expensive for several reasons one they obviously can't just suck water right up from the edge of the lake where the cities are because that water is too polluted I mean it's not nearly as polluted as the days back when you know the river in Cleveland caught fire the de-industrialization of the Upper Midwest has been economically catastrophic but environmentally beneficial nonetheless the water along the Lakeshore is still pretty polluted so they have pipes that suck water from miles out into the lake and when they get that water they start to do lots of filtration and purification steps and then the big thing that makes the tap water expensive up there is all of the old old pipe infrastructure all the old lead pipes and the constant work of gradually replacing all of that infrastructure New York City water does not come from the arguably Midwestern half of Upstate New York it comes from the mountains of Eastern Upstate New York a historically industrial area for sure but that was back in the first Industrial Revolution which was powered by water water wheels you build a mill next to a fast-moving Cold River fast moving for obvious reasons more more energy more kinetic energy and you get that from a mountain river where the the grade is steep just Falls faster and you want that River to be cold because cold water means less algae and other biological growth that can Gunk up the wheel make the wheel rot Gunk up all the little channels that you dig to channel water to your wheels cold water is better but not too cold not too cold such that everything freezes in the winter it's a real Goldilocks situation and the two parts of the world with the magic combination of climate and topography and access to raw materials for the first Industrial Revolution they happen to share the same name these two places England and New England of course that's probably more than just a geographic coincidence in fact it's a logical correlation that pokes a hole in geographic determinism which is an interpretation of world history that I probably over embrace yes I do think the physical shape of the world and how the climate whips around that shape I do think that probably does determine a whole lot about the people who live on any given spot in the world but that's certainly not the whole story England and New England were the hotbeds of the first Industrial Revolution because they shared similar geographic features yes but also because they shared people it's called New England because people from England settled there and that's how English inventors of Mill equipment came to design and build factories in the Americas it's not just that they share geography they shared people and it was people who had the ideas geographical determinism does not determine all but then I suppose you could argue that it was geography that determined that English people would settle in New England in the first place I mean it was right across the pond and Eastern Upstate New York is really more New England than it is Mid-Atlantic you had lots of water Mills up and down the Hudson Valley converting the kinetic energy of running rivers and streams into torque that could power a million different machines by means of ingenious systems of gears and wheels and belts water Mills were not as clean as we romantically imagined them to be they impeded the flow of rivers creating back water areas of stagnant water that could become very stinky water Mills were terrible for the fish in the rivers just as hydroelectric power plants are terrible for fish today there used to be salmon Atlantic salmon in the river is running into Lake Champlain and Lake Ontario salmon in the Connecticut River all wiped out by dams that kept them from reaching their spawning grounds salmon spawn up in fresh river water they get eaten by bears but their babies hatch and swim down river out into the lake or the ocean where they live most of their lives and then one day they get an itch to swim back up River they start to dream of somewhere to relax their Restless flights somewhere out of a memory of lighted streets on quiet nights they can't get back there because a damned Mill Pond is in the way so no salmon left in New York water Mills were not environmentally blameless but they were far cleaner than the factories of the Second Industrial Revolution powered by coal and oil and gas the factories that sprang up in the midwestern United States and down South during Reconstruction once a cold fast-moving River stopped being the power plant for your factory well there was no reason then to have a factory tucked up in the mountains where labor was both scarce and organized the labor union movement in America was born in the early Mill towns if you can run a mill anywhere thanks to coal and steam well then you might as well swing down south where formerly enslaved people would be willing to do just about anything other than sharecropping which was basically agricultural slavery by another name and oh hey not coincidentally that's also where they grow the cotton that you weave into cloth in your Mill so yeah build your factory somewhere like Macon Georgia where I used to live that's a thing that happened you can do that as soon as you don't need water power anymore for your Mill and all the old water Mills in Upstate New York sat vacant for almost 100 years and then people started converting them into artist colonies and antique stores and luxury Loft Apartments point is thanks to this particular pattern of low impact industrialization followed by de-industrialization you've got beautiful clean cold water in Upstate New York today at least in the eastern mountains and that water flows conveniently down south into the pipes of New York City and New York City for all its flaws has really great tap water I do not believe the lore that states that the secret to New York style pizza is New York City tap water there just isn't a lot of non-water stuff in basically clean water not a lot of solutes in clean water it's enough that you definitely taste it when you're just drinking the water but by the time you stir in like a ton of flour and salt and such I I just don't believe it maybe the mineral content affects the gluten and the starch on a chemical level that might affect texture or workability of the dough or something and certainly pH affects how does stretch and brown and mineral content affects pH but clean tap water really shouldn't be too far away from a nice neutral seven if it is somebody at the water treatment plant is done screwed up it's a different story in Brewing or maybe uh soup making because there you're talking about products that are mostly water and so yeah you might taste the quality of the water there but I really doubt that it affects the flavor of breads much at all I'm ready to be proven wrong I would love to do that test video if anybody wants to mail me a gallon of NYC tap water I'm game get in touch please don't poison me water quality can definitely make a real difference in coffee which is why I only use my finest water to brew my finest coffee beans which I get from Trade coffee love trade sponsor of this episode what are the finest coffee beans well you know I'm not totally sure I like exploring I like sampling I like experimenting Trade coffee is a coffee subscription service that makes it so simple to discover new coffees and to make the best cup of coffee at home every day trade partners with top-rated independent Roasters to send you coffee that they know you'll love fresh right to your home and on your preferred schedule and you get to support small local businesses the roasters it's a win-win I told trade hey surprise me I'm adventurous find me unusual roasts but I also told them that I like bright acidic coffee which generally comes from lighter roasts lighter roast does not mean weaker coffee mind you you brew it as strong as you want and I do I told them that I like to grind whole beans myself I recently got like a hand crank grinder that I'm really liking I like simple machines non-electric machines but you can get pre-ground coffee if you want from Trade pre-ground coffee has come a long way thanks to Modern freshness seals and you do not have to have any fancy equipment at all that's for sure you know an old school drip machine makes fantastic coffee I've been playing with an Aeropress lately it's another very simple non-electrical machine cheap machine it's nice because it Brews almost instantly but I still think I prefer the old French Press which is about as simple as it gets just stir the grinds with some hot water let it sit about eight minutes is what I like strain out the coffee and enjoy probably my two favorite coffees that I've gotten from trade is this Rwandan coffee roasted by Sterling in Portland it's really dark and fruity at the same time it's got this kind of dried cherry flavor to it my other fave is probably the honey processed coffee from Alma outside of Atlanta I visited them for a video Once you might remember it's a great place honey process is basically a cross between the standard wet processed coffees where they ferment the beans in water and then they wash off the outer fruit before drying the beans it's crossed between that and the natural process where you dry the beans right inside their fruits love the honey process

Yorkers get their water basically the way that Roman Caesars got their water I see Mountain pools pulled by gravity downhill Into the Heart of their otherwise fetid reeking sewer of a city a lot of cities get their tap water from surface water Macon Georgia where I used to live has great tap water great tap water it won best of the best award for taste in 2009 from the American Water Works Association best tasting water in the whole country that year according to an organization that exists in part to give Awards to its own members but that's fine the Oscars are basically the same deal right Macon Georgia water tastes great in part becomes because it comes from a lake rather than from a river even unpolluted river water can be pretty gross especially down south where it's warm and rivers are more hospitable to life of all kinds the current churns up all the gunk at the bottom all the sediment the organic and inorganic sediment at the bottom Southern rivers are brown mud slicks Macon used to get its tap water from the Okmulgee river that runs through town it's a pretty yucky River like most rivers in the Southern United States big brown mudslides then came the flood of 1994. it was called the worst natural disaster in Georgia history tropical storm Alberto over the Florida Panhandle joined up with a cold front from Alabama to make the perfect storm as they say 12 inches of rain on the 4th of July weekend in Macon the Okmulgee flooded and there's old news photos that you can see online of like gas stations and fast food places underwater but that wasn't the main problem the Okmulgee always used to flood so people generally did not build right in the flood plain the problem was that the flood took out the water and sewage treatment plant that was right on the river so the Taps stopped working the toilet stopped working like 200 000 people were without modern plumbing almost three weeks and the flood also took out the major highways which parallel the river as roads have done for Millennia because people have always walked along rivers to know where they're going so it was hard for them to truck in bottled water to Macon President Clinton came down to feel everybody's pain and they were in pain three weeks without clean running water or flushing toilets is a pretty dire situation it seems like it shouldn't be given that humans have lived for hundreds of thousands of years without clean running water or flushing toilets but those humans were adapted to those conditions we are not it's rather like how people lived without air conditioning up until like 50 years ago you would think that we could handle a summer without air conditioning given that our ancestors lived all of their Summers without air conditioning they were adapted to it my old house in Macon built around 1917 long before air conditioning and it had several features adapted to sweltering Southern Summers it had a big front porch a big Topic in southern cultural studies is how social relations changed once everybody in the South got air conditioning and they stopped spending every evening out on their front porches gabbing with their neighbors and eavesdropping on other people's conversations and gossiping about them Etc all on the front porches my old house had a really big front porch loved it it had big windows and the rooms were built such that they had big windows on multiple walls you had a window at the front of the room and another window on the side of the room or in the back of the room and you could open both sets of windows so that you could get a cross Breeze flowing through the room that keeps you cool my old house also had this uh this weird fourth bedroom in the back we couldn't really figure out what the deal was with this room it seemed a little too small to be a bedroom and it was only accessible by walking through one of the other bedrooms it was not accessible by a hallway or some other more public space in the house the walls in this little room were made of modern sheetrock drywall right rather than the other walls in the house which were all the original plaster it just didn't make sense until I learned about sleeping porches sleeping porches were basically screened in balconies that Southerners built onto the backs of their houses always the back of the house because you wouldn't want people on the street to see you waddle out to your sleeping porch in your evening clothes and lie down on the little second bed that you kept out there so that you could actually sleep on the hottest nights of the year better to sleep outside than not at all at least the screen keeps out the mosquitoes my house was well adapted for its climate and then everybody got air conditioning air conditioning was a better way to keep cool that's why they switched to it and the house gradually lost its climate adaptations the old rope and pulley Windows got stuck one by one as those windows always do and people who lived in the house just kind of stopped repairing the windows and then somebody painted the Windows shut just painted over the windows and let the paint dry inside the little crevices between the windows and the frames thus sticking them together we could not open our windows in that house any of the windows and most of the time you wouldn't want to air conditioning takes a lot of electricity electricity is expensive and so you want to keep your conditioned air safely sealed up inside your house as much as possible we couldn't open our Windows because we had lost our climate adaptations and that was fine because we wanted to keep them close to keep in the AC at some point some prior owner of our house decided to wall in the old sleeping porch they decided that the sleeping porch would be more useful if they put up solid walls fully sealed it in just like any other room in the house that way when they sold the house they could list it as a four-bedroom house even though this supposed fourth bedroom was Tiny and only accessible by walking through a door in the main bedroom it made a great room for the for the baby's crib I have to say but the house lost its climate adaptations and that was fine until the air conditioning broke one day in July or maybe it was June regardless it was heat of the summer and we did not have five thousand dollars with which to buy a new compressor what we had instead was a brand new baby and a toddler in a half body cast because he broke his leg the day after his brother was born for the second time it was the second time that he broke his leg not the second time that his brother was born either way his mother was in real rough shape and the house was a furnace people who lived in that house in the 1920s had babies and plaster casts and all kinds of other problems in the middle of scorching summer but they also had windows that opened and a sleeping porch so now when cities lose power in the middle of summer people die hundreds of people dozens maybe die because the buildings have lost their climate adaptations likewise the tap is now our only system for getting clean water back in the day people who had didn't have Taps well they had other systems like building their house next to a well or a stream if you believe your house will always have a running tap then you don't bother building it next to a well or a stream nor do you bother acquiring the knowledge of how to safely and effectively draw water from a well or from a stream Taps are better than Wells or streams until water stops coming out of them one day because a tropical storm flooded your water plant that was by the river because the river is where the water comes from it's the logical place to build the water plant except for the fact that you know Rivers sometimes flood so after the disaster of 96 everybody in Macon resolved to not make the same mistakes again Macon bought some land up in Jones County way up it is up high in the Hills high above the river in altitude and they spent lots of money pumping river water up into that Reservoir to build what they call Javers Lucas Lake named after the incredibly long-serving Macon Water Authority board member Javers Lucas a pillar of macon's black community he attended Tuskegee Institute study engineering fought in World War II in the Pacific but he wanted to be an artist like his father Henry W Lucas so he studied Photography in the Army and ended up photographing a B-29 bomber called the Enola Gay shortly before it dropped the little boy bomb on Hiroshima Javers Lucas also worked at a water treatment system for the Army Corps of Engineers a little bit and when he got back home he served 37 years on the Macon Water Authority commission and so they named their new Reservoir after him and they built it big way bigger than Macon would need they figured that they could make some money supplying water to other faster growing communities in the area and maybe they could also attract some new industries that require large amounts of very clean water reliably lots of Industries are like that and the water is clean because in a large deep Reservoir all the sediments settle onto the bottom so you don't have to do as much work filtering that water before you send it down to people's taps and it's easier to send down to people's Taps because most of the Taps are topographically down relative to the high altitude of the lake so gravity does the work and it will never be flooded this Reservoir because it's way up high relative to the river which is down here the water authorities still owned a whole bunch of land right on the River where their water treatment plant used to be and that land wasn't really good for anything else because of the flooding so they decided to turn it into a giant Park Emerson Waterworks Park 180 beautiful Acres a giant open lawn where I ran our old dog Lucy around for the last time before she died it was later where I flew kites with our kids for the first time Meandering Trails through the woods where we pushed their strollers big playgrounds or we let them get their energy out during covid lockdown as long as I can remember my own life I will love Emerson Park and one day there was a big storm and the park flooded pale Brown silt from the bottom of the mighty Okmulgee covered up everything and the park had to be closed for weeks while they cleaned it up and people in the comment sections of local news articles said hey whose stupid idea was it to build a Park right next to the river that floods they posted these comments apparently unaware that the whole reason Amerson is a park and not a water treatment plant is because it floods you can't do anything else with the land so you might as well use it as a park anyway some great City fathers and mothers had the foresight to invest in a good large deep relatively high altitude Reservoir and now Macon Georgia has the best tasting tap water in the nation in 2009 they usually leave that part off that they only won the award once 13 years ago but they still have really good tap water all the time way better than the tap water where we live now in Knoxville Tennessee which comes not from a reservoir where all the silt and other Gunk can settle and sink to the bottom but it comes straight out of the Tennessee River another loose stool of a southern River the Tennessee River is I mean they treat the river water before they send it to you in the tap but it does not taste as good as the water from javery's Lucas Lake most tap water in the United States comes from surface water like a river or a lake or a reservoir or it comes from the ground only about one percent of the Earth's fresh water is on the surface in things like lakes and rivers and permafrost 69 of the Earth's fresh water is locked in glaciers and polar ice caps rapidly melting not quite as locked as one would hope the remaining 30 of Earth's fresh water is deep in the ground and we pump it up to the surface from Wells that we dig groundwater occurs in aquifers layers of sand or gravel or permeable Rock like Limestone all soaked in water Rocky sponges basically groundwater is particularly crucial to people trying to farm in the vast semi-arid stretches of the American Interior where much of our food is grown here far more groundwater goes to irrigation here in the United States than goes into people's taps irrigation supplied by aquifers is totally essential to Modern farming and here's a fun fact and by fun of course I mean terrifying of all the groundwater within a mile of the Earth's surface where we can actually get at it less than six percent is renewable according to one estimate that I found and I found other scientific estimates as low as 1.5 percent the rest of the groundwater is non-renewable once we've pumped it all up to irrigate our crops it's gone strictly speaking of course all aquifers are renewable water ran down into that permeable Limestone once and so it probably shall again but not within the span of human lifetimes that's a thought that keeps me awake at night anyway groundwater some groundwater tastes amazing but some of it tastes like you know the ground particularly like Limestone unsurprisingly groundwater tends to be what they call hard water high in dissolved minerals mostly magnesium and calcium from the Limestone calcium you can taste in the water and it tastes kind of salty kind of bitter kind of chalky you can see it with your own eyes the the scale that builds up on your shower head that's deposits of minerals left behind by hard water particularly very hot hard water because of how rapidly it evaporates and leaves behind its solutes and then there is sulfur when your tap water tastes or smells like rotten eggs or like farts or like dead things that's going to be your chemical element number 16 ma'am that's going to be your sulfur sulfur is your problem right there or more specifically sulfate and hydrogen sulfide sulfates are polyatomic ions combinations of sulfur and oxygen and they are common in lots of wet soil and rock formations underground where our wells reach the sulfates just dissolve gradually into the water and they smell like farts hydrogen sulfide is a gaseous chemical compound that is literally the smell of death or rather it is one of the hundreds of gaseous compounds emitted by decaying organic matter many of which contain sulfur hydrogen sulfide is often found in large underground deposits in proximity to groundwater as in the case of Wells that are drilled near say fossil fuel deposits but the main source of hydrogen sulfide in drinking water is bacteria generally non-pathogenic bacteria they each sulfur and they poop out hydrogen sulfide which smells like death these bacteria are happy in low oxygen environments like deep deep Wells these bacteria are also heat tolerant they're an example of an extremophile or an organism that thrives in environments where you'd think nothing should be able to live at all you may have heard about like sulfur eating bacteria found around underwater volcanic Vents and where it's just so hot and there's no light no no organic matter to eat it seems like nothing should be able to live there but these bacteria can because they don't mind the Heat and they eat sulfur and sulfur bubbles up from the bowels of the Earth in fact there's a bacteria species that lives deep beneath the silt off the coast of Namibia called The sulfur pearl of Namibia and this bacteria a single one is almost a millimeter wide you can see a single bacterium with your naked eye it eats sulfide and to do that bacteria normally need oxygen but there's no Oxygen dozens of meters down deep beneath the silt off the coast of Namibia so these bacteria use nitrate instead of oxygen to metabolize the the sulfur there's also not a lot of nitrate down there either so this bacteria relies on big storms that stir up the silt and bring nitrates down from the surface you only get a storm like that once in a while so these bacteria grew insanely large for the purposes of storing nitrates for a rainy day as it were I guess it's the opposite of a rainy day is what they need it for anyway sulfur eating bacteria are extremophiles and as a result they are often found in hot water heaters and pipes and such they're perfectly happy in the Heat and you are more likely to smell their gaseous products when you have the water running really hot because heat makes everything more volatile so you smell it I remember going to visit my Ohio grandparents out in the country where they had to dig a well because you know Municipal Water didn't go all the way out there and whenever anybody took a shower that whole house smelled like a fart otherwise I have very happy memories of that house so getting back to Sam's question from like a half hour ago one reason why tap water in coastal communities might taste bad is that they are getting it from Wells deep Wells when your city is on the ocean most of the surface water around you is either salt water in the ocean which you can't drink or brackish water in the mouth of the river that empties into the sea next to your city that's probably why you built a city there in the first place because a big river opens up to the Sea right there and thus people can sail from the ocean up into the Hinterlands from that spot and so that's a logical spot to put your Harbor and your Trading Post and all of that that spot where salt and fresh water mix can't drink that water either so you've got to dig a well to get fresh groundwater and you might have to dig a particularly deep well to get down into the parts of the water table where there is no salt water intrusion from the ocean deep down there you could be easily dealing with any of the sources of sulfur that we just discussed Sam specifically mentioned the Eastern Seaboard of the United States most of which is the North American coastal plain which is a line of super sandy soil all up and down the Eastern Seaboard super sandy soil that was deposited there over millions of years by river is emptying out into the sea sandy soil tends to leech sulfur as we discussed in the video from last year about Vidalia onions the vidalia region near Coastal Georgia has super sandy soil because coastal plain rain flushes sulfur from decaying organic material on the surface the rain flushes that sulfur down through that sandy soil where it eventually settles and collects deep down below the sand deep down where you might have to drill your well in order to avoid salt water intrusion closer to the surface so your water tastes farty but at least you can grow really sweet onions because there's hardly any sulfur on the surface where you farm maybe you do have access to a fresh water source like you you have a lake that just happens to be near your Coastal Beach Community or maybe you have a reservoir that you fill with river water before the river gets too close to the Sea and mixes with the salt water it becomes brackish Sam asked about the beach specifically and by that I think he means Coastal communities that people visit for fun those are usually down south where it's warm and where it's warm there is life in the water like algae algae is a really common problem in lakes and reservoirs in warm places algal metabolites can be stinky one example being giasmine the smell of dirt that we talked about in a video not too long ago another is called a methyl isobborneol ISO borneel I'm just gonna call it MIB everybody calls it MIB anyway it's MIB another problem is MIB which smells uh musty that's another algal metabolite all metabolites common in surface water sources in warm climates such as beach towns because algae lastly Sam mentioned that water at the beach tastes thick to him if it's very hard water from a well lots and lots of dissolved minerals very hard water water can taste almost slimy or people call it scaly water people often address hard water by treating it with water softeners water softeners might use sodium ions to pull minerals out of the water the result is slightly salty water which people often describe as tasting slippery or feeling slippery on their skin to me it tastes kind of warm another explanation that I've read is that soft water feels slippery on our skin because it does not have the dissolved minerals that normally stick to us a little bit you know the mixture of dissolved minerals and soap that sticks to our skin and to our shower walls that is known unappetizingly as curd fun fact but maybe what you're feeling is the salt I suppose it's possible that some Coastal Water Supplies are particularly salty thanks to a little salt water intrusion or maybe I don't know incomplete desalinization in the case of fresh water produced by a desalinization plant there are also cationic polymers used as flocculants in water treatment flocculent there's a disgusting word they stick to decaying organic matter they cause it to Clump up and then settle out of solution at the bottom of the tank at the treatment plant I've read that cationic polymer residue from water treatment can also feel slimy when you drink it have I given you enough guesses yet Sam that's the best I've got well actually I've got one more guess everybody wants to go to the beach I want to go to the beach you want to go to the beach everybody who owns or governs Beach property knows that everybody wants to go to the beach and so they don't worry so much about their water the people who own or govern these properties they know that people will want to go to the beach no matter what even if everything else about the trip sucks so they figure hey we might as well not bother wasting money on improving the taste of our tap water tourists gonna come no matter what I know that not everybody wants to listen to the Adam or goossia podcast all the way through the Adam regusia podcast is not like the beach not everybody likes it I'm so glad therefore that you chose to listen to the podcast all the way through this is why I try very hard to make the show not stink like sulfur sure do appreciate you uh keeping this here tap open until it runs dry which it will do right now after I say you can submit a question for a future episode at askadomquestions at gmail please submit them in video or audio form and write up a little text summary in the email itself I'll check you on YouTube Monday with the long-awaited lacto fermentation vid did the dill pickle time lapse shot work find out Monday at 2PM Eastern 3 Central that's how they used to say it on the TV kids talk to you next time make good

3lb (1.36kg) mock tenderloi...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.182271, this one goes out to the Irish guy who got really angry about the tomato-based pot roast that I cooked one time he insisted that pot roast has plain brown gravy and well that sounds good to me today the trick is how to make the gravy taste like something we'll get there but first the meat today I want sliceable pot roast rather than one that you break up into chunks and to get the best slices which you want to look for is an oblong piece of meat meaning the muscle fibers run side to side instead of up and down we will slice across the fibers there's lots of cuts from the animals hindquarters that people use for a sliceable pot roast but this is from the shoulder it's called the mock tenderloin because it kind of looks like a tenderloin but it's not it's one of the rotator cuff muscles much more intramuscular fat and better flavor than any kind of round roast it is super chewy but that's why we braise it for half a day just to save on dirty dishes I'm oiling this up right in the cold pan ton of pepper a few big pinches of salt and then I'll just smoosh everything around to get the roast coated then I'll I'll turn on the heat to Brown it for a steak or something small you really have to get the pan hot before you put the meat in otherwise the inside will be overdone by the time the outside is brown but this is a big thick roast so it's going to be fine while that's heating up I'll peel and dice a few shallots not necessary but they'll help the gravy taste like something and if I cut them small they're pretty much just going to dissolve into the sauce over the long braise let's see how the meat is doing gonna need more color than that but I really advise going easy I'll actually turn the heat down a bit you can brown or roast really slowly and it comes out just as good if you're too aggressive with your heat you end up scorching the pan like that when that dissolves into the sauce it's going to make everything taste burned especially in a plainly flavored dish like this you can grab like a wet paper towel with some tongs and rub it off just deglaze that one bad spot of the pan while you leave all the good Brown fond intact my heat is like medium and I'm just going to go nice and slow Browning all the surfaces a bit and if if the Brown is on the bottom of the pan or on the meat itself it doesn't really matter everything is going to dissolve together in the braise you just need some Browning somewhere to create a base of flavor and honestly that's enough people think you got to get maximum Browning on every square millimeter but you hit a point of diminishing returns where you mostly just risk creating burned flavors that's good enough I'll throw my shallots in and let them fry for a couple of minutes until Brown and I swear this will not be a tomatoey pot roast you will not perceive a little squeeze of tomato paste as being tomatoey especially if you brown it a little just goes a really long way toward intensifying the taste of a gravy once that's browned it's time to deglaze and sure I'll use a carton of beef stock because I have one but it really doesn't make a huge difference you could just use water you know what I need I need my broad wooden spoon the queen of all cooking utensils use that to scrape all the brown stuff off the bottom if you look at those instant brown gravy packets they sell the ingredients are mostly just garlic powder onion powder Maybe some powder a dry mushroom or yeast extract for Umami but if you don't have that you can just use some soy sauce and then some assorted dry herbs also those packets have starch for thickening but we'll do that later reduce the heat to a simmer cover so that the exposed meat steams you could transfer this to the oven I would do 275 Fahrenheit 135 Celsius but I'm going to do it all on the stove today this will take hours to soften it's an easy meal but not a quick one if you need something for a weekday consider cooking with hellofresh sponsor of this video let's see what's on there always seasonal menu this Autumn looks like some cozy stuff I think I'll do these Korean barbecue wraps these are going to take like 10 minutes hellofresh recipes rarely take any longer than 20 or 30 and each bag comes with all of the ingredients you're going to need pre-portioned you don't have to think about what to do with the leftover ingredient that's probably just going to end up sitting in your pantry until the next time you move but if you do move you can change your address with a few TAPS in the hellofresh app or change delivery day pause deliveries there's a kid-friendly plan veggie plan pescatarian fit and wholesome hello fresh can be a great way to keep to your goals because

sorry I steamed you if I poke at the meat a little I can tell that it's starting to soften but it's gonna need like another two hours until it's really tender when I think I'm an hour hour and a half away I will start leisurely working on my vegetables carrots will take the longest to cook so those first I think I'll do big hearty chunks today skinny ones can be whole pieces fat ones I'll cut in half lengthwise honestly you could have the carrots in from the beginning overcooked carrots are still pretty good overcooked potatoes are not in a stew they fall apart and they make the gravy all gritty it helps to use waxy potatoes but I would not put these in until the meat is pretty close to being done when in doubt wait because you could always take the meat out and hold it while the vegetables catch up I've got some celery that I'll cut into big hearty chunks and the last thing I'll put in is some big chunks of green onion I love these in stews but I would only cook these for like a 20 minutes max I'll chop up the greens and save them for garnish roast has been simmering for almost five hours and when I push on it I can feel the meat fibers pulling apart I actually think I overcooked this a bit if you want to be able to slice your Meats you've got to stop braising just before it gets fall apart tender I will take that out give the veggies another few minutes until they're almost fork tender remember they're going to keep softening even after after you take them out I'm taking everything out with a slotted spoon and transferring it to a heat safe platter that I could hold in a warm oven until it's time to eat time to finish the gravy sometimes I thicken at the beginning so that I don't have to pull all the food out but the advantage of doing it at the end is you don't have to guess how much thickener you're going to need it's not necessary but I think one of the easiest ways to sex up a gravy is to throw in a packet or two of powdered gelatin you can scatter that right onto the sauce but it's safer to disperse it in a little cool water first to avoid clumps it just needs to sit for a few minutes and Bloom thicken you'll see it happening stir that into the sauce and it won't do much to thicken at least not at such a low concentration but it will give the sauce a really sticky glossy finish that I associate with good French cooking even though this is ostensibly Irish I'm really just trolling that Irish guy today for my main thickener I'm using a cornstarch slurry but you could use any starch or flour just disperse it in a small amount of cool water cool so the starch doesn't gelatinize is prematurely and Clump speaking of which you gotta drizzle really slowly and stir vigorously as you do this or else you're going to get little ropes of starch in your stew that looks like enough for now let's taste that plain brown gravy and it's not bad it's a little Bland needs acid and pungency and a great way to get both is with some mustard any tart mustard that's a great way to elevate a plain gravy while not turning it into a curry or something it still tastes Northwestern European in that way that is Bland at worst but clear and clean at best no one will know if you summon forth the upside down bear they'll just know that the gravy tastes better a little sugar or honey just enhances everything else adjust seasoning and all of that remember that the gravy is going to thicken more as it cools to eating temperature so yeah we're done time to slice our beef against the grain yeah see I overshot the mark and now it's shredding a bit as I slice it's fine obviously gonna look great once it's covered in gravy and there's certainly no shortage of gravy really satisfying and comfy that is fall came all at once this year in East Tennessee and in that context this is really hitting the spot,3

2021 paper...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.182271, to hear the internet talk about resistant starch you would think that there's some kind of secret way to convert potatoes and pastas and rice and such into virtually zero calorie foods that's what resistant starch does for you unfortunately that's not really the case yet there are scientists trying to engineer foods that would be kind of like that because it is true that not all dietary starch affects the body in the same exact way and scientists are still kind of working out the differences this is a relatively new area of research it is true that some starch seems to evade digestion in our small intestine most starches digested in the small intestine it's broken down into simple sugars that absorb right into your bloodstream but some starch doesn't break down it passes to the large intestine where it feeds your gut microbiome instead of spiking your blood sugar and that's probably a good thing in most modern diets where we typically get way too much sugar and not nearly enough fiber resistant starch is a kind of dietary fiber oh and Brits by fiber of course I mean fiber resistant starch is a kind of fibre this was proven in the 1980s by Hans English and colleagues at the University of Cambridge who did much of the foundational research here quote it has for long been believed that starch is completely digested and absorbed in the small intestine of man but anglist and cummings here proved otherwise by studying seven people with ileostomies that's a hole that a surgeon makes in your belly to empty waste out of your small intestine before it ever even reaches your large intestine your colon surgeons do this in cases where the colon or the rectum doesn't work right or maybe it was removed surgically Anyway by studying the contents of people's ostomy bags relative to what they ate these brilliant Brits proved that not all starch is broken down and absorbed before it hits the human colon most of it is but not all of it and some foods seem to have proportionally more resistant starch than others like about six percent of the starch in the white bread and the Corn Flakes they fed to their human subjects seem to resist digestion whereas almost none of the starch in the oats resisted digestion oh so corn flakes are actually healthier than oatmeal no absolutely no one said that oatmeal still has way more fiber because resistant starch is not the only kind of fiber the big kind in oats is soluble glucan which is just a different kind of indigestible polysaccharide and because it's water soluble it's particularly good for you because it slows the release of sugar into your bloodstream probably the biggest single reason why eating a bunch of junk food makes us feel terrible and eventually get very unhealthy is is this it's because the junk food has lots and lots of sugar quickly absorbed sugar you eat a whole bunch of sugar it is absorbed instantly almost instantly into your bloodstream and once there your body releases insulin to transfer the blood sugar from your blood and into your cells where it can be used or stored as fat as necessary the problem with that is that now you have no blood sugar left in your blood and so like it's an hour or two after you ate all of that junk food and you're super hungry all over again because your blood sugar is just completely tanked so you eat a bunch of junk food again and so the cycle repeats forever and ever and ever and it's terrible foods rich in soluble fiber gum up our insides and therefore only a little sugar gets absorbed into our bloodstream at a time this stabilizes our blood sugar it stabilizes our hunger and it makes us less likely to overeat resistant starch is not the only kind of fiber but it is a good kind and it seems to have properties of both soluble and insoluble fiber depending in part on the kind of resistant starch we're talking about scientists have identified five types so far and this literature review out of China has a handy visualization for each of the five types resistant starch number one is physically inaccessible starch starches of course are just long chains or branches of sugars glucose your body makes enzymes that break those chains apart into their constituent sugars and that's how you absorb them this visualization shows starch granule was locked inside strong cell walls perhaps this is a fragment of an underdone potato to quote Charles Dickens Jacob Marley was actually resistant starch anyway in this scenario the starch is locked up it's kept as secure from your

word to save 83 percent thank you surf shark so resistance starch number one is physically inaccessible starch your digestive enzymes literally cannot reach it in order to break it down let's look at rs2 that's what uncooked starch granules look like kind of like clam shells made up of hundreds of thousands of starch molecules rs2 is uncooked starch granules when they're locked up in the clam shell like this you cannot digest them nobody eats raw potatoes because they're disgusting but we do eat raw bananas or in this case plantains well actually nobody really eats raw plantains but they do eat them kind of slightly or lightly cooked and in that event you probably have some resistant starch too in here and you have lots of it in under ripe bananas once the banana fully ripens all the starch converts to Sugar that's why it's sweeter but if you like slightly green bananas like I do well then probably some of the sugar in there is still in the form of starch and since you're eating it raw it's going to be rs2 resistant starch number two is raw starch which you cannot digest RS3 is starch that you cooked so the granules swelled up with water and they exploded that's called gelatinization gelled starch is normally quite digestible but in RS3 you have cooled starch back down again causing retrogradation which may look like this or it might look like this basically the starches link back up with each other as they cool and they form new crystalline structures that's why Cold leftover takeout rice tastes crunchy in particular long grain rice like this basmati long grain Rices have more amylose starch relative to the other kind which is amylopectin and amylose is particularly prone to retrogradation to the point where the little crystals that it forms survive the reheating process that's why reheated long grain rice always tastes like a little still crunchier mealy but that mealiness is resistant starch number three and that is good in this 2015 study out of Indonesia they fed some people freshly prepared rice and they fed some other people rice that they reheated out of the fridge and they measured everybody's blood glucose after the meal the group that got the reheated rice had slightly lower blood glucose like here 5 5.83 an hour after eating compared to 6.49 in the group that got the fresh rice now your results could of course depend on so many factors like the exact kind of rice you're using and how hot you reheat it how long it was in the fridge all that kind of stuff and the research is actually less clear about how much of that resistant starch number three actually survives reheating in other foods like say potatoes some studies find very little RS3 in reheated potatoes but there are situations where we eat cold potatoes right as in a potato salad that means potato salad is actually a health food no no it doesn't because only a tiny fraction of the starch is resistant and all this mayonnaise is a much bigger line item in your calorie budget that said processed food manufacturers are absolutely researching ways of creating starchy snacks that are almost entirely resistant starch and that really would matter in that case we're probably going to be talking about RS4 which is starch that has been been chemically modified one way or another to be indigestible the fifth and final type is pretty interesting it's when amylose starch links up with fatty acids in your food and makes starch lipid complexes that are indigestible so many of our favorite foods have a lot of carbs and a lot of fat and it's pretty tantalizing to think that they could under the right kind of cooking conditions cancel each other out the carbs and the fats so scientists are studying that possibility a lot because duh that would be awesome hence the Spud project a currently in progress set of experiments happening in the UK where they're going to try making mashed potatoes lots of different ways different chilling and reheating methods different kinds of fat and they're going to see how all of these different recipes affect people's blood sugar I hope to report those findings to you when they become available but until then don't go thinking that the carbs in your food don't actually matter because oh they might be resistant the actual quantity or proportion of resistant starch in most normal Foods is probably just a few percentage points of the total carbs in the food so it's just not that big of a deal at least in terms of your calories but even a small amount of resistant starch could still matter to your health because when it reaches the bacteria in your gut they ferment resistant starch into short chain fatty acids and these are probably really good for your health for reasons that we'll talk about another day,3

Thanks to Raycon for sponsoring this...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.182271, it's the Adam regusia podcast episode 28. this is a speech that I gave to a conference of young professionals organized by the Chamber of Commerce in Knoxville Tennessee where I live the speech is called champagne problems it's all about the bad things that happen and really just a few weird things that happen when all of your dreams come true which they might so listen up so uh most people in the audience I I think I know something about you I think I know that you have chosen to attend a conference for young Professionals in the middle of the day organized by the Chamber of Commerce and that tells me that you are probably ambitious like you're you're a gunner you really want to make it whatever it is to you am I right about that I said am I right about that yeah there it is well I stand here before you a specimen of a human who has very recently made it uh a few years ago I had a I had a good career I had a solid you know University salary um but I had very little control over my own destiny and almost no money in the bank kids you know today I own my own company with my wife we work for ourselves we work as much or as little as we want to we have a fair bit of money in the bank I spend my days following my own curiosity and my creative impulse wherever they they lead me I make whatever things I want to make and literally millions of people all over the world gobble up my Wares gratefully I sit on the side of the river that y'all are trying to reach so I intend now to give you some idea of what it's actually like over here and thereby help you to develop a mental image of what success might actually look like for you so that you can know what to expect if you actually get where you're trying to go by being in this room right now it's mostly good over here on this side of the the river of struggle definitely better than on the other side I have no intention of ever going back to the other side if I can avoid it but uh over here on the better side things are not perfect these are problems that one might rightfully characterize as champagne problems but they are problems nonetheless and I will describe four of them for you now I'm not trying to Gin up sympathy for all of those those poor Rich folks all those atlases laboring under their Globes rather I will describe these four champagne problems so that you might be better prepared if you achieve the success that you are trying to achieve by being here today so champagne problem number one you're still stuck with yourself success changes your circumstances far more than it changes you you can buy yourself one of those big mansions up on uh Lions view Pike overlooking the river you know what I'm talking about you could buy one you could tear it down build a nicer one as I believe someone is doing right now behind one of those tall stone walls you can buy one of those but I regret to inform you that you'll still be the one living in it and all of your endogenic problems will remain with you well what does that mean well there is a large and growing volume of scientific literature on the topic of happiness what makes people truly happy to study this scientists look at self-reported data of course you know you ask people how happy they are and what they think makes them happy but you certainly do not stop your investigation there because people are very often wrong about what they think makes them happy a pathological Gambler thinks that one more spin of that wheel will make them happy and they are wrong about that a pathological eater thinks that slamming an entire Pizza will make them happy and it may in the very short term but in the long term not so much and I may speak from experience on that one scientists look at endogenic versus exogenic causes of Happiness exogenic causes are things that happen to you endogenic are the things that happen within you having a YouTube video randomly go viral almost four years ago now and all of the good feelings that Stroke of Luck has brought me though that's all exogenic arguably exogenic because even if you get a break you get a stroke of luck you still have to dig deep inside yourself to capitalize on that luck unless you are very very very lucky unless you say inherit hundreds of millions of dollars from a parent in that event it's possible to do just about everything wrong from that point forward and remain very wealthy and Powerful you don't have to play the game all that well if you start with a really full health bar but the kind of luck that you can more realistically hope for is the kind of luck you have to actively capitalize on and it's the kind of luck that you have to help make my Stroke of Luck did not come out of nowhere I first had to make a good video about how to make pizza that a lot of people might want to watch and share I spent the whole first half of my life developing the skills that would ultimately allow me to make such a video and to then make hundreds more such videos though I certainly had no idea that this particular thing is what I was working toward that whole time I was a music Major how about you success particularly success based on Fame is highly unpredictable you can create the conditions for Success like you can create the conditions for a good sourdough starter but what microorganisms ultimately colonize your starter that is exogenic anyway happiness research happiness research one of the things that scientists look at to quantify happiness is certain biomarkers dopamine serotonin endorphins those are all neurotransmitters positively associated with happiness cortisol adrenaline hormones negatively correlated with happiness though of course those are crude generalities I can think of a few activities that Spike my adrenaline that I also I think make me happy but anyway there's a there's a well-known 2014 literature review performed by uh Iranian scientists looking at biomarkers of Happiness endogenic versus exogenic causes and what their review indicated is that's between 35 and 50 percent of biologically evident happiness may be attributable to genetics alone I'm sure plenty of psychologists and other scientists would dispute the specifics but I doubt any would challenge the core assertion that genetics play a really big role in a person's capacity to feel good so that's problem number one you should anticipate with success your underlying predisposition toward one mood or another toward one mode of behavior or another that will not change you can still make a hell out of a mansion up on Lion's View and I guarantee you that someone up there is probably doing so right now you can improve your behavior with hard work and with therapy but nothing can buy you a new genome which leads us to uh champagne problem number two money fixes so many problems just not all of them there's a there's a famous 2018 study out of here in the U.S it's from Purdue University and UVA psychologists here tried to find out how much money is enough to make you happy and there are many similar such studies but this one was remarkable in its scope they looked at the whole world and they naturally found that the level of annual income positively correlated with happiness varies considerably from place to place happiness is more expensive in Northern America than it is in Southeast Asia for example specifically it is 35 000 a year more expensive in Northern America compared to Southeast Asia according to this particular study this was a study of 1.7 million people worldwide and so they're not looking at like biomarkers of Happiness here they did not collect 1.7 million urine samples so they could see how much adrenaline people are excreting rather the data came from the Gallup World Poll so we're talking about survey data here like self-reported information however good psychologists don't just ask people how happy they are and then take their word for it they they ask more detailed questions to try to suss out the truth for example this particular poll used what's called Cantrell's self-anchoring striving scale where zero is your worst life and 10 is your best life they ask you which rung of that ladder you think you're on other studies that have really dug a lot deeper into individual human subjects have found that responses on this particular scale do tend to be generally pretty accurate the author authors of this paper also looked at what's called a effective well-being they dug into people's answers on questions like uh you know what kinds of experiences have you had lately how do those experiences make you feel did you spend more time yesterday laughing or stressing out or being sad that kind of thing the researchers dug into all of those responses and compared people's apparent level of happiness to their level of income and here's what they found in Northern America so U.S and Canada you got to make at least a hundred and five thousand US dollars a year to feel like you're living your best life it's described in the paper as life evaluation satiation and I guess I could describe that finding more precisely as once you make at least 105k a year your income ceases to be a predictor of whether you feel like you're living your best life you may feel like you're living your best life making way less money making way more money but these findings indicate that on average 105k a year is the most money that can help you live your best life after that you're on your own money can get you pretty far toward happiness but it can't get everyone all the way there just because I know people are curious here's that uh life evaluation satiation income level for some other regions of the world it's a hundred thousand US dollars in Western Europe 45 000 in Eastern Europe in the Balkans 110k in East Asia 115k in West Asia North Africa 40K in sub-Saharan Africa and 35 000 a year in Latin America and the Caribbean on the level of large regions of the globe Latin Americans need the least amount of money to be happy despite the fact that Latin America is not the poorest or cheapest part of the world Latin Americans seem to need a lot less money to be happy relative to their cost of living why is a very interesting question that is the subject of ongoing scientific investigation I'm not saying it's the food I'm just saying it might be the food incidentally my new band is called it might be tacos playing at The Outpost next weekend no cover that's a joke I don't know who's playing at The Outpost sorry that's the money that it takes to live your best life it takes a lot less money to not feel scared all the time to feel basically secure to have the bottom of Maslow's pyramid on lockdown to have your food your shelter your physical security that kind of thing these same researchers put income numbers on what they call negative affect Association so what this is this is the maximum amount of money that people need to make a year that reliably predicts an absence of self-reported bad feelings like lots of stress and sadness overwhelming everything else in Northern America that's 95 000 a year just to not feel bad in Western Europe and Scandinavia it's only 50 000 a year Western Europeans and Americans need about the same amount of money to feel like they're living their best life but Western Europeans need way less money to just not feel bad to feel basically secure an obvious explanation supported by other research would be the far more robust social welfare states in Western European countries that's what higher taxes can buy you less fear for most people I say this approvingly as someone who has recently started paying so much money in taxes and it hurts too let me tell you it hurts because is not like being withheld from my paycheck like it used to be right like we have to sit down now and actually actively send where's to one government or another and I fully support it but it hurts okay sorry to interrupt Adam Adam here just dropping in to say that uh you know everything goes down better even tax payments with some delicious mixers from Shaker and Spoon sponsor of this episode I love Cocktails so very much they are such a source of enjoyment in my life and Shaker and Spoon has helped me enjoy totally new drinks

recently shot well above the point at which money is a reliable predictor of any kind of Happiness am I happy do I feel like I'm living my best life not totally no for reasons that we're gonna get to it's great great to not be afraid anymore I spent so much of my life afraid about uh you know my ability to make rent my ability to pay off Sallie Mae my ability to not get fired from my job my job that provides Health Care to my children because somebody in the United States thought that was a good system at some point I hated being afraid and I will never go back to the fear if I can avoid it but that becomes its own kind of fear leading me to Champaign problem number three loss of moderating external forces Financial Freedom is freedom and with freedom comes responsibility responsibility to not act like a jerk even though you can for most of my adult life if I acted like a jerk there was a good chance that I would eventually lose my job I'm sure there's a point at which I could behave badly enough now that my audience on YouTube would abandon me but looking at the behavior of certain other YouTubers I think I'm in no real danger of hitting that upper limit anytime soon I have achieved what the kids these days I'm told call Fu money though they don't normally Express that with an initialism when you have Fu money you can afford to speak your mind to tell everybody what you really think of them does that sound like the dream to anybody here does it sound like the dream be honest it's not it's not the dream stop dreaming it few times in my life when I have exercised the rights and privileges afforded to me by Fu money whenever I have told people what I really think of them I have immediately regretted it don't do that doesn't feel good Live Your Truth absolutely live your truths but that's not the same thing as speaking your truth without any care for other people's feelings in some cases speaking my truth has hurt other people's feelings and in some cases I don't really care about their feelings because I do think that some of the people in question are garbage people but I still think it was bad for me it was bad for my soul for lack of a better word that I said what I said and it was bad for the general civility within my Society for what it's worth it's just funny that this mirrors my feelings on like a capital punishment yeah like I think that there are people in this world a few people who deserve to die for their crimes but I think that putting people to death diminishes us the people making and executing the sentence and therefore we shouldn't do it also it's absurdly expensive to put people to death and we convict innocent people all the time and once you kill them there's no way to make it right and the whole system is super racist so there are lots of other good reasons to not do capital punishment anyway money when you ask successful people about their regrets in life they generally talk about how they treated other people because people whose lives turned out really well typically don't regret missing one opportunity or another how can you regret that when your journey LED you here and here is great there were times when I regretted dropping out of grad school for example but like not anymore that was a stop on the path that got me here and here is great I do regret how I treated other people it's not all big things like I regret interrupting someone else in a meeting so that I could get a chance to show everyone at the table how smart I am those are the kind of memories that uh keep me awake at night and that's the stuff I did before I even had Fu money when you win money you lose external forces that moderate your behavior and that means you have to work harder to moderate your behavior yourself that includes being good to others and it includes being good to yourself not over working yourself my definition of success isn't just about money it's about freedom I work for myself I can work as much or as little as I want and I will be paid accordingly the more videos that I put into the YouTube machine the more money comes out and the only limit on how much I can make is how much I'm willing to work and apparently I'm willing to work way way too much as evidenced by the fact that I'm operating this camera while giving a speech I'm not terribly greedy I I work too much because I am scared I'm afraid that something will happen and I'll have to go back to being afraid again afraid about whether there's enough money in the account to cover that check that I just wrote to pay the power bill or whatever I'm afraid of being afraid again sometimes I feel like I'm on one of those game shows where they lock you into like a Plexiglas box with a wind machine and a bunch of paper currency flying around and you get to keep whatever you can grab within 60 seconds and I must look like a a cat chasing a dangling toy like I'm scared that the money machine will stop blowing which could happen if you notice my uh my eyes are watering a lot and I'm blinking a lot it's because I cut my eyeball the other day it was not a kitchen accident now that's what you're thinking according to the doctor I've got some kind of Scar Tissue on my right eye perhaps from an old injury and it kind of dried out in the night and I was sleeping and I I blinked and my eyelid just kind of caught on the scar tissue and stuck to it because it was dry and it tore my eye open a little hurt real bad and I couldn't even open my good eye I had to keep them both shut because when you open one eye the other eye moves with it even if you keep the lid closed and that was just agonizing pain so I was blind for a day couldn't do anything that I normally do to make money and this is not the kind of job where you can call in sick and they still pay you this is different from other kinds of success where say you work really really hard you maybe earn an advanced degree and then a large institution just pays you a generous flat annual salary that's what my brother does Dr Tony ragusia he's a psychologist up in Pennsylvania he's on staff at a hospital makes real good money as long as he shows up and doesn't commit like egregious malpractice he can probably count on having that income until he retires that's Dr ragusia I'm Mr ragusia I make more money than Dr regusia which is really pretty profane when you think about it Dr regusia saves people's lives Mr ragusia invents the recipe for crust pie somehow the market assigned greater value to Mr ragusia's work explain that one at least it assigns greater value to my work for now I have no idea how much longer this Con is going to run so I rise and grind every day and it is killing me I'm not that happy I'm not nearly as happy as I should be I'm just so exhausted all the time I have no external force moderating my naturally workaholic Tendencies the workday doesn't end and that is bad I have to learn to say no more and so may you one day you may also have your own employees one day and side notes if you're ever mad because they don't work as hard as you do at the business that you own remember that you work more because work is literally more rewarding for you right nobody wants to work anymore people say well make work more rewarding and I think people will want to do it I'd rather have money than no money I'd rather have freedom than no freedom but the fact remains that there are particular things that are hard about having money and freedom it's hard to make it's hard to make decisions when you have money and freedom like how should you pay your employees that's a hard Choice made harder when lots of options are available to you fewer options can really be a blessing you know what I'm talking about like a giant menu at the restaurant is great but like clap if you'd rather see a small menu yeah me too I'm with you I have a job where I could live anywhere in the world anywhere I want all I need is internet and Light cost is a factor so like you know maybe not every neighborhood in the world is open to me but every city is sure imagine yourself in the same situation like you have a job and an income that would allow you to live anywhere in the world that that's like a realistic scenario right because I I bet a lot of you already work jobs that you could kind of do from anywhere that has internet huh where would you choose to live seriously somebody like shout it out where would you choose to live if you could live and work anywhere I hear San Diego what was that over here Anna Maria Island that sound I don't know what that is but it sounds beautiful Maine don't play to the crowd sir send Knoxville Tennessee you'll see what plane of the crowd gets you I chose Knoxville Tennessee true story we could have chosen to live anywhere and we chose here for a few reasons it's very beautiful lots of architectural Beauty lots of natural beauty I like mountains I like Rivers I like trees I like flowers got lots of those here you got all four seasons here but Summers are long and Winters are short I really like that great public schools for the kids very big research University a mile from the house I've lived in college towns my entire life it's it's good to be around young people and it's good to be around smart people college towns have both though they are not always the same people there's really no like big city amenity that we lack for here and yet it feels something more manageable than a big city I spent a decade of my life dealing with Atlanta traffic never again and of course we have family here my wife Lauren grew up in Blount County so really we asked ourselves where in the whole world would we like to live where we also have family and that narrowed the options considerably and that was good it narrowed the options considerably because no matter how much money you make your family remains your family this goes back to Champaign problem number one you remain yourself and yourself includes your family can't buy yourself a new family not that I would want to if I could you remain yourself when you cross into the domain of champagne problems but your relationship to everyone else changes and that is champagne problem number four and Final social disorientation I'm the same person but I'm not the same person in relation to you and I'm still getting used to that I'm still reorienting myself figuring out my my new role in all of this I can't complain about the state of the world as much as I used to like who who the hell is in charge here if not me I'm in the one percent the richest one percent of people in the whole world who run the whole world and have most of the money that's me now and that is terrifying it's rather like an experience I had in my early 30s I was sitting in the house one day there was a knock on the door I opened the door and there were three kids holding a puppy hey mister you want this puppy we found it near the dumpsters at our apartment complex and we're not allowed to have dogs there so you you want a puppy mister and in that moment I thought to myself oh no I'm the adult in this situation this puppy is my problem because I'm the grown-up here whatever I was planning to do today has to stop because I have to find out who this puppy belongs to or find it a new home which we did we founded a new home when you join the world's richest one percent you acquire an ownership stake in the system whether you want that ownership stake or not and when the system goes awry you can't just say somebody ought to do something about this you ought to do something about this because it's your system whether you want it to be or not it is disorienting you also just kind of forget sometimes that you don't have to be cheap anymore like uh I was booking a plane flight from Knoxville to Detroit the other day for a for a shoot it's gonna be my first plane flight in a long time and out of habit I booked the worst possible flights I I think it was gonna stop over in Toronto or something no bags no carry-ons included middle seat back of the plane where it smells weird and Lauren my wife she like saw me booking this ticket she looked over my shoulder at what I was doing on the laptop and she said are you crazy just buy the good ticket and what's crazy is the good ticket was only like eighty dollars more first class what do you mean my first time in my entire life flying first class is going to be to the D to make a video about Detroit style pizza pizza is there a 500 ticket but the difference between the terrible flight and the great flight is only like 80 bucks I never knew that uh sorry Adam it's Adam again you know another situation where the good stuff is surprisingly affordable is uh the everyday earbuds from raycon sponsor of this episode hopefully they'll forgive me at raycon for saying that I'm generally not a big fan of wireless audio I always seem to have trouble syncing my devices together over Bluetooth but I've never had one problem at all with my raycon earbuds you just put them in you hold down the button to turn them on open up the Bluetooth panel on your phone or whatever and raycons will appear just click them you're connected and you only have to do that the first time after that it's it's all automatic I usually use earbuds when I'm running so the fit is really important to me I cannot have my earbuds falling out in the middle of the road the everyday earbuds come with a bunch of different sized really soft cushy gel tips you just pick your perfect fit and they do not fall out they feel really soft and comfortable in your ears too they sound great of course you can also turn on noise cancellation just by holding down the the button again they call it the awareness mode turn that on and the headphones just cancel out to the ambient noise around you via the magic of phase cancellation which we've we've talked about on the podcast before great battery life too 32 hours eight hours of play time and when it's time to charge they snap magnetically into place in their little charging case but the best part is you get all of that for half the price of other premium audio Brands half the price so go to buy raycon.com today use code atom R15 to get 15 off your raycon order that's code atom R15 at buy recon.com to score 15 off by raycon.com code atom R15 that's all in the description thank you raycon so yeah I was I was telling the young professionals about why I always used to buy the worst cheapest airplane ticket why have I been taking the terrible flight my whole life it's because I'm frugal which up until very recently was a virtue I have to realize that now it's a vice the same behavior isn't Frugal anymore it's stingy because there's lots of other people in the world who would like some of that money some of them may feel that they deserve it and they might be right so what do you do in this situation well for one thing my new uh my new Baseline for tipping is 50 percent I always used to tip at least 20 percent now I always tip at least 50 percent some of you may applaud this but others of you are probably thinking oh oh so I have to deliver a pizza to you to enjoy your large yes I have to perform some menial active service to get a tiny taste of your ill-gotten gains you capitalist some of you were thinking that don't lie I would be so Lauren and I have started having serious conversations about major and ongoing philanthropic commitments but then we also have to learn that we're not Bill and Melinda Gates not least because we are still married and like each other um but also because like we're in the one percent but we're at the like very bottom of the one percent when you're in the 99 all the one percent looks the same right but then you get in the one percent and you're like oh oh no it is not it is not all the same our brains are not wired to comprehend exponential differences in numbers right like four is twice as much as two that's a big difference but it's only a difference of two eight is twice as much as four which sounds like the same difference but it's actually a difference of four not two and keep going and eventually you get into some incoherently huge numbers truth is I'm not a master of the universe I'm not in charge here Bill Gates is in charge Elon Musk Jeff Bezos Warren Buffett Larry Page actually no not Larry Page Larry Page owns Google and Google owns YouTube Larry Page is the best but all those other guys they're they're the jerks in charge not not me don't blame me but put me and my ridiculous YouTube income into a corrugated metal Shack in a Township outside of Cape Town or wherever and see if I make the same argument to the people in that room so those are some of the champagne problems that await you young Professionals of Knoxville Tennessee I sincerely hope they await you because well they are so much better than the other kinds of problems I thank you for your attention and I think we've got time for a couple of questions just remember that uh this is being recorded So if you don't want to be on my YouTube channel you know don't say anything so anybody got a question you can just stand up and shout at I'll repeat it and I'm like me and your passion okay so the question is you know was cooking always your passion and if so did you ever feel that you would just kind of burn out on your passion and when you turn your passion into your livelihood it is certainly the case that work is work no matter how great work is it will start to feel like work okay um and things that you would have done for fun the other day like you feel like I'll have to get out and do the fun thing again because it's work like it's just that's the fact of life it's the way it is um I've always been interested in food and and cooking yes it was it was not always my main interest um it was not where I thought I would end up but you know Fame chooses you you don't choose it um and so here we are and uh do I get burned out uh I get burned out in the sense that I'm working too much but I've I've actually been able to avoid getting burned out on like thinking about food all the time because I I was very fortunate to stumble into success on a topic like food that connects to like every other thing that's important about life on this planet right um so when I say I do food and food adjacent things that basically opens up almost everything you know um and and my audience Blossom have been willing to kind of go there with me even when the leap was not as obvious as it is on other other weeks you know um and I as I've been doing this more and more you know and they've been along with you for a long time and I can push a little bit more and so I've been going further and further afield and that's been that's been keeping me interested for sure I mean one thing you know I mentioned that I was a music Major in school and grad school composition I was like a you know prodigious kid um who burned out and disappointed everyone you know mostly myself you know but uh you know part of the problem there was that it's just like I I never I could never focus on the thing that I needed to do like I just because I was interested in Lots like too many other things it wasn't that I it was lazy I was just sort of you know squirrel right um and and I that made me bad at school and I always thought it was a vice but then I like stumbled you know bass backwards into the public radio station in Indiana University and you know where all the misfit toys go um over-educated people with nothing to offer any place else in the world and and I started reporting and I got a job where my job was to become interested in a new totally different thing every day and then forget about it and then do it again the next day and all of a sudden this personality trait that was I thought was a bad thing about me became an asset and I I've tried to remember that to remember that like you know I am not broken you are probably not broken um some of you may I mean some of you may I mean if you're if you're like a serial killer that's a bad thing just try not to be that you know but like short of that like I'm pretty confident that you're not broken and there's like a a place where your little puzzle piece fits um where where you're not fighting who you are naturally where you can just who you are naturally is who they need there you know and I I would encourage you to to to hold out and look for that because it's probably out there especially in this insanely specialized economy that we're in you know I used to go around for Mercer recruiting undergraduate students and you know going to a lot of um you know uh you know schools with like 100 free and reduced lunch that's the kind of student population talking about um where we really wanted more more kids and we were trying to develop talent and I'd go there and like I'd say so what you know what do you all want to do and they would just say I want to be a nurse or a doctor and it's not that they were all like had you know healing as their passion I think it's that's the jobs that they knew about for you know those are the jobs they've seen those are jobs they've seen on TV and what I always just tried to say I was like look you know just whatever vague subject area is most interesting to you just just walk in that general direction because like the economy of today is such that like most of the jobs that you all are going to have are things that might not even exist right now and there's certainly things you've never heard of right like so just just go go walk in that direction the direction that you feel pulled and like don't be a jerk to anyone be the kind of person that people want to work with and you know you will probably find your your place I hope but I am also cognizant that that's a privileged perspective so there it is a question over here yeah so I will be your guest speaker at your public relations class at the University of Tennessee um but the question was like you know can you um can you diversify in a job like this can you sell products can you sell merch can you sell books can you can you get into other businesses and make more money that way but also probably you know I think more significantly as implied by the question uh can you avoid burnout can you can you do just do different things and I would say that yes you can do all of those things um you know a much more famous food YouTuber named Joshua Joshua Weissman um has a cookbook that like you know topped the New York Times bestseller list um and that you know that's these dudes making a lot of money from that and that's great um I would say that if I was younger I would probably be exploring more such opportunities right uh I I um you know but this this happened to me in my late 30s and I'm grateful for that every day because I I can't imagine the psychological burden of the of the attention and the stuff people say about you on the internet you know if this had happened to me when I was you know 27 or God forbid 17 you know I don't know how people survive that frankly um so I don't know I'm old and I don't want to work that much longer so I kind of don't want to open up a whole lot of other doors like I want to stop um and I've sold merch and stuff but I do it more as like kind of fan service because people want it and you don't you don't make as much money from that stuff as you make from from the other stuff and like being selling media is a really good job because you don't you don't have to like track packages you don't have to deal with people like like it was a guy he's in Michigan and he's like I I'm a developmentally disabled person I love your your channel um my I ordered your chef's knife and it was stolen off the porch of my house and I know you say you sold all of them but like is there anything you can do and like what you know what do you what do you do like you can't you can't not figure out a solution there so like we found like one that had like a minor Factory defect in it and we we sent it to him and he was super grateful but it's like I and I was glad to do that but I don't want to be doing that all the all the time and multiply that times you know a thousand or a million right it's it's just that's just like a much harder job um yeah there's a reason why like you know like so I'm very interested in like Fitness media too and I've been sort of transitioning my channel there a little bit my audience seems interested in Fitness content and like in the fitness world there's a reason that all of the companies yeah they'll sell you their little powders or their t-shirts or whatever but what they really want to sell you is their workout plan PDF right because that's a thing you make one time and then all you do is like upload it and people download it you do nothing else and you just watch the money come in and if you know it's good work if you can get it uh one more question probably time for one more question do you think one more okay um uh you were first yeah how do I balance my gratitude for what I have with my ambition for achieving more um I do have a little ambition you're achieving more like you know it's especially given that I was a reporter for so many years and I worked in non-profit media for so many years like I worked in public broadcasting like I was and that involves begging people for money all the time like asking people for money to support what we do and I suddenly find myself in a position where I can be the one who gives not the one who begs and that's like that's that's really exciting like that's like wow like what what could I do what could I fund that no one else is funding that's like that's really tantalizing uh and I think if I were a little younger or a little more ambitious I would probably just I would probably Branch out and try to become like an Empire and make a ton of money and then be like a a social entrepreneur you know like fun companies that make the things that I want to see in the world but I'm too old for that um so one one of you will have to do that and I you know I have every confidence that at least at least one of y'all in here is gonna do that big group of bright faces and I've really appreciated getting to talk to you so thank you very much [Applause] so there you go thanks to Amanda O'Dell and everybody else at the Knoxville Chamber of Commerce for inviting me to come

Pastina — tiny pasta porridge,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NNvyKMp3JAY/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLB-3Gp8HuKTpzY07ppxzmXZPREW_g,NNvyKMp3JAY,"8 minutes, 23 seconds",Thanks to Fetch Rewards for sponsoring this video!

pasta shape but more broadly it refers to a way of cooking said Tiny shapes that's very different from other Italian pasta dishes you can cook these more like rice than like pasta meaning you only use a little bit of boil water and you don't drain it off at the end the result is a porridge of pasta like couscous but generally a lot creamier than couscous it's more like risotto you can put vegetables and all kinds of stuff in with the pasta but first let me show you the basic this is apparently a thing that a lot of Italians grow up eating when they are sick the shape is a tiny star but it could be letter pasta anything very small for liquid you could use plain water some people use milk I think I like chicken stock the best for this but obviously you could use veggie stock and the ratio that I like is four to one liquid to pasta by weight or three to one by volume at least with this particular pasta shape other shapes will measure differently by volume I'm just doing one portion so I've got a cup and a half of stock that's 355 mils I'm throwing a leaf from my sage plant in there just to infuse the stock a little but you could use any herb dry or fresh bring that to a boil and then I'll stir in about 90 grams of this dry pastina which is half a cup three to one by volume four to one by weight and it'll seem like not nearly enough pasta at first but give it a few minutes stirring frequently so that nothing sticks to the sides of the pan when you cook pasta normally in a large excess of water you don't really have to worry about sticking but you do here like five minutes later we're almost there I'll fish out the sage leaf before things get way too sticky the key is to stop cooking and mix in all your other ingredients a little before the pasta is done and all the water is absorbed heat is off bubbling has about stopped and I'll melt in a knob of butter I've seen people put this in earlier but that breaks the natural Emulsion of the butter if we melt it in gently at the very end it'll stay creamier a couple of grinds of pepper in something this subtly flavored you'll really notice the fresh pepper so go easier than you normally would grate in some Parmesan or pecorino cheese we're finishing this just like risotto stir it in and taste for seasoning you might not need any additional salt given the salty cheese and the store-bought stock is salty you could call that done or you could stir in an egg if I was making two portions I would use a whole egg but I'm only making one portion so I'm just using the yolk that'll be more luxurious anyway the key is to wait until the bubbling has totally stopped and then stir really vigorously or else the egg is going to curdle and you're going to get ugly ribbons of cooked eggs streaking through I've got one little streak right there but otherwise I have kept the egg creamy not curdled and over the two minutes in which I've been finishing this dish the pasta has finished cooking and absorbed the last of the free liquid in there if you want it soupier you can always add liquid at this stage but I think the ratio I gave you is a good starting point you can always add liquid you can't take it away kind of looks like cave VR right and it feels a little like caviar in the mouth smooth little pearls you can grate on more cheese maybe give it a swirl of olive oil on top for some heterogeneity and that is some comfort food right there it's like a cross between oatmeal and mac and cheese but with the Finesse of a good risotto in a fraction of the time that it takes to make risotto let's try it again but make a nutritionally complete meal out of it I'm making four portions and I'm starting with about a quart or a liter of water that's conservative but we can always add get that coming to a boil and instead of using a meat stock this time I'm going to use a handful of dried mushrooms morels are expensive you could totally use something way cheaper any really fragrant dried mushroom will give you a meaty tasting liquid after they've boiled for a bit in the meantime I can consider the rest of the groceries I just bought and maybe scan the receipt with fetch rewards

mushrooms have gotten like a 10 minute Head Start I can start putting in other stuff like a handful of these Frozen fresh lima beans I love those but they need like 15 or 20 minutes to cook they're not like frozen peas which cook instantly small vegetables that you can buy just one of at the grocery store my favorite kind the carrot will take the longest to soften so I'll cut it first hand above and around the knife stabilizing it while I cut it lengthwise now I can lay these securely on their flat faces and cut them into quarters and then I can slice crosswise and those should cook pretty quick into the broth they go the mushrooms will need like a half hour total to soften and they've been going about 15 minutes so we are right on track next I'll chop up this shallot any form of onion is fine and I'll peel and chop a couple of garlic cloves in with all of that looks like we've had some evaporation need more water so let's borrow a page from risotto technique and throw in a glass of white wine not necessary but very nice with the celery I'll save those leaves for garnish at the end cut this into little sticks and then cut across the sticks in those go the quickest cooking veg is going to be the zucchini I'll cut that in half lay those securely on their flat size and then I'll think I'll need to quarter each of these to get sufficiently small pieces so cut those into eight sticks cut across the sticks and those little pieces will need I don't know 10 minutes max and we're there so in they go I suppose I should throw in a pinch of salt to start with given that we're not starting with a salty store-bought stock a few grinds of pepper and now we'll just simmer the veggies until they're almost perfectly tender which turned out to be seven more minutes time to stir in one cup of dry pastina about 180 grams this is going to seem like not nearly enough for four portions but I'm trying to make a healthier meal here so I want the mass to be like half vegetables at least plus check how much the pasta expands give it a stir now and then so that nothing sticks and all the pasta Cooks evenly like five minutes later here's how much liquid we've absorbed we're probably going to need to add some more but that's fine you can always add heat off and I'll melt in a giant knob of butter this is four portions great in a big pile of cheese and only because I have one lying around I'll grate in some lemon zest I really like how the zest freshens up a stewed vegetable dish and you can still use the juice in something else another day a handful of frozen peas mostly for color all they have to do is thaw and maybe some chili flakes just for fun get all that melted in definitely going to need some more water but that's fine the bubbling has fully stopped but the pot is still steaming so it's the perfect time to stir in eggs I'm doing two whole eggs for four portions stir vigorously and the eggs should not scramble they'll just go nice and creamy taste for seasoning needs more salt but I think I'll take my salt in the form of more cheese oh and my celery leaves for garnish stir that in and we are done you could use vegan sour cream in place of the butter and cheese and you could skip the eggs entirely but I really like how their texture interacts with the little pasta shapes it's really quite a luxurious silky texture plus we've got a nutritionally respectable meal here lots of veg a little protein it's good and again far quicker and easier than making risotto use a bag of frozen vegetable medley instead of the fresh veg and you've got dinner in like 10 minutes just don't tell your Nona about it or do tell your Nona about it she respects efficiency,3

about this powder if you consume a lot of Fitness related content you've probably already heard the good news but being that this is more of a general interest food and nutrition Channel some people here might not know hashtag not an ad there is a flavorless white powder you can ingest and almost instantly it just makes you about 10 percent stronger it's totally legal it's allowed by every major athletic organization it has minimal side effects it's safe for all basically healthy adults to consume oh certainly talk to your doctor about it first but that's basically the deal there kind of is no catch with creatine it's one of the few legal supplements that actually works I mean Beyond Sports Nutrition there are all kinds of supplements that work like if you have a doctor who tells you to go on like prenatal vitamins or something for God's sake go on the prenatal vitamins they prevent birth defects there's lots of nutritional supplements that work but I'm talking about the supplements that claim to be able to get you jacked most of the legal ones either do nothing substantial or more often they're just kind of really gussied up and overpriced versions of very very simple basic things like stimulants caffeine stimulants do basically what you would expect them to do as athletic performance supplements there's lots of gussied up and often overpriced versions of pro protein powder protein powder works because it's really just a food it's a highly refined food as much as sugar is a food protein powder is a food it's a basic essential macronutrient other than that the only legal strength supplement that's proven safe and effective by Decades of research is creatine creatine is probably the most studied Sports supplement other than maybe protein but protein is just a food and if it would help you in whatever you do in life to be about 10 percent stronger well then you might consider taking three to five grams of creatine every day talk to your doctor about it of course and this may not help you in every physical activity but for anything that requires like short bursts of power for that creatine will probably help whether it's lifting weights or lifting heavy boxes at work that kind of short intense effort really relies on the anaerobic Energy Systems of the body and creatine supplementation really seems to help with those particular Energy Systems it's fact totally essential to those systems which is why your body makes creatine it's in you right now even if you don't drink this creatine is just an amino acid it's non-essential meaning your body makes it you biosynthesize creatine in your liver and kidneys and pancreas and you do that out of essential amino acids that you get from eating protein from food that creatine goes into your muscle cells where it performs an absolutely crucial role in the incredibly complex biochemical processes that convert food energy into actual work do not expect an explanation of the Krebs cycle right now I am not qualified just know that every time you move a muscle there is a whole series of chemical steps that have to happen inside your cells to convert your blood sugar into actual muscular contractions other animals have creatine in their muscles for the same exact reason so if and when we eat their muscles we get additional creatine on top of the creatine our bodies make lots of creatine and red meat in particular and it's been shown that people who eat meat have more creatine in their muscles than people who don't eat meat it's a modest but meaningful difference that probably means meat eaters are a little stronger all else being equal but that's fine you don't have to eat meat you can supplement creatine just as you can supplement protein to recover from my workouts I generally drink milk protein because it's cheaper and easier to prepare than meat and it's probably a lot more sustainable way is just a byproduct of the cheese industry it's going to exist whether they sell it to you or not because they're going to make cheese no matter what does taste kind of gross though you know it tastes better magic spoon cereal sponsor of this video tastes like a sugary kids cereal but the number one ingredient is milk protein there's zero grain s'mores flavor hey cool they sent me a magic spoon bowl and Spoon let's see chocolate chip cookies this one has zero grams sugar they use Locale Alternatives like allulose 5 grams net carbs and 13 grams of protein excellent the texture is very similar to your childhood favorites and the flavor is often indistinguishable to me and they make cereal bars now too very convenient if you're on the go similarly excellent macros with a delicious chew great snack for students in this back to school season hit my link in the description and build your own variety box fruity is probably my favorite flavor but they've got tons of options and different specials all the time use my code regusia and you'll get five dollars off if you don't like it for whatever reason they'll give you your money back no risk they ship here in the U.S Canada and the UK now too go to magicspoon.com regusia save five dollars with my code regusia thank you magic spoon so that was an ad the ad is now over and I want to reiterate that absolutely nobody from like the creatine industry is paying me right now to extol the virtues of creatine I'm talking about it because it's true and I want to in fact the supplement industry would probably much rather I hype their other products because creatine is so easily and cheaply synthesized that there's a lot of competition in the market so they really can't make much money off of it it's inexpensive some Brands sell more expensive forms of creatine that they claim are superior but the specific form that's been researched for decades and proven is creatine monohydrate the most common kind which you can find under a million different brand names this particular brand was the first big commercial creatine supplement to hit the market it was back in 1993 the year before there had been a minor controversy at the 92 Summer Olympics in Barcelona prominent track athletes were taking creatine and this is before creatine was well known creatine would definitely improve performance in like the shorter track events your Sprints your hurdles the Olympic Committee does not ban creatine because it's proven safe and it would be hard to tell via screening if somebody got their creatine via supplementation because we all make our own creatine and we get it from food mostly meat that said in order to saturate your muscles with all of the creatine they could possibly hold you'd probably have to eat a lot of meats like way more meat than would be healthy for a normal person so supplements the muscle creatine difference between a supplemented person and a normal meat eater that's about as big as the difference between a meat eater and a non-meat eater which is to say it's not a huge difference but it's big enough to notice it depends on your body's size and composition of course but generally scientists find that five grams of creatine monohydrate a day is the most anyone's body can actually hold any more you would just pee out an extremely high doses could hurt your kidneys you can start with a loading phase of about 20 grams a day for a week that has been shown to help you get your muscles saturated faster and then you just maintain at five grams a day thereafter without the loading phase it takes a few weeks to hit that saturation point and get maximum benefit and what exactly happens when you first load up on exogenous creatine well I can remember what happened back in my early 20s I think is when I first started taking creatine and I remember like hours after I took my first big dose I got incredibly thirsty and I had this very weird feeling all over my body like all of the water in my body was being sucked into someplace else in my body which funny enough turns out to be exactly what was happening creatine is an osmotic just like sodium so it basically sucks up water sticks to water when you supplement creatine it's gonna make you thirsty you'll drink water and then you will gain weight maybe a couple of pounds of water retention and that's a bad thing when it happens in response to sodium that you eat because sodium is stored in your blood and therefore that extra water retention that you have it goes through your bloodstream and it raises your blood pressure that's the main reason why sodium is potentially bad for you sodium is also found in lots of other tissues and so that's where all that water goes and it makes you look kind of puffy I look puffy sometimes but it's not because of the cream creatine it's mostly because of the pizza and other garbage creatine is almost entirely stored in your muscles so the extra water from creatine goes into your muscles and if that's visually appreciable at all it just makes you look slightly more jacked so anyway the first time I loaded up on Creatine I got really thirsty and I drank a lot of water and then I was fine and a few days later I went to the gym and I was just suddenly noticeably stronger just all of a sudden it was that simple I was just stronger the 35 pound dumbbells felt like 30s it was a miracle studies consistently find that people on creatine supplements are able to push about 10 percent more weight though there's a lot of variation around that Center and women don't seem to usually respond quite as well as men though they do respond if they respond some people don't respond to creatine supplementation at all and nobody knows why according to some studies as many as a quarter of people just don't seem to respond at all it doesn't hurt them but it doesn't help them could creatine hurt anyone well well the experts generally say the same thing which is that people with kidney or liver disease they should not take creatine and maybe not people with high blood pressure though on the other hand there are some studies indicating creatine can actually help with high blood pressure that seems to be an open scientific question creatine could interact with certain medications so as always talk to your doctor and the experts generally say that kids teens should not take creatine because all kinds of things that are perfectly safe for adults can mess with a growing body and also there's just not much research about young people taking creatine and what it does to them there is one study that found an increased risk of testicular cancer among people who took over-the-counter strength supplements which included creatine but were not limited to creatine so it might not have been the creatine plus some other scientists who read that study wrote in to say well you know the real cause might be anabolic steroids that people take in addition to the legal supplements people sometimes make anti-creatine arguments comparing creatine to steroids and that's just completely insane I mean I'm procreatine But ultimately the effect is pretty modest and therefore the risk is modest steroids can completely transform you but it comes at a cost there's a lot of really really big risks with steroids which is why they're generally illegal in most jurisdictions here's another anti-creatine argument that you hear sometimes people say what's the point of taking creatine as soon as you go off the creatine you're going to lose the extra strength yeah that's a silly argument that's like saying what's the point of food I mean you eat food and you feel great but then if you ever stop eating food then you get all like weak and tired boy food food sucks when you ingest anything that's needed by your body's energy systems well that's going to allow you to do more work which is good and in the gym it allows you to lift more weight which allows you to stimulate more muscle growth and the gains stay with you even if you go off the creatine but I'll probably never go off the creatine because there's basically no downside I usually put it in with my protein shake and Studies have also shown that you're more likely to actually absorb it into your muscle cells if you eat it with some sugar so I usually have a few bites of something sweet afterward because I'm not a real athlete there's just no downside to creatine now tell me have you heard the good news,3

Thanks to  @My Name Is Andong ...",2022-11-24 14:47:05.183328, hey it's adam ragusia and there's a guy who also makes food videos on youtube you might have heard of his name is ondong kinda he and i are gonna talk about work and borsh and his being a content creator of eastern european descent in the present time of war and then we're gonna do adam's failure of the week and some audience q a j w white j wants to know if i'm still on the fence about cast iron pans i'll let you know but first here's andong i've been doing this for four and a half years now and i focus on unusual takes on food from all around the world and how we ended up eating the things we're eating i feel i feel silly asking you why your channel is called my name is ondong considering that your name is andong um but then again you could have just called it ondong right like so so where'd the name come from well that's okay that that's a longer story because my name is not actually andong my legal name is a russian name so i was born in saint petersburg russia or actually it was called leningrad soviet union back then i was born in the last days of the soviet union and my legal name is arsini and it just then i moved to germany which is where i grew up in berlin germany and it was already really tricky to translate this russian sounding name into german and when you transcribe it to a version that sounds decent in spoken english it just sounds absolutely nothing like my original name neither the russian version nor the german version that i grew up with so i was like okay i might as well just choose a completely new name to work with on the internet uh that also like when i say it that people kind of know how to write it or have a chance of knowing how to write it and i ended up choosing my chinese name which is andong which is based on my middle name anton much simpler um and that came about because i i studied chinese actually chinese studies in university i lived in china for a while and that's where i discovered my passion for food so in the place where i discovered my passion for food everyone kept calling me andong so i was like that's that's a good match let's just roll with andong for my like food youtube endeavor that's how i ended up being my name is andong even though my name is not actually undone it's a declaration it's an affirmation it's a declaration exactly i love it so you're russian and uh you confessed recently in a video that you don't actually like borscht no i don't i'm not a big fan of boris i think it's just like a little like a little food issue i have i don't like any cabbage based soups or stews i think they taste very one-dimensional and i know there are many of them and it's not like i can't eat them i think they're fine you just pissed off your russian fans and your chinese fans right there by dissing cabbage uh i'm not dissing cabbage i love cabbage i just don't like cabbage based soups because the cabbage flavor just takes over and it just tastes like cabbage soup and so does borsch also not a huge fan of beetroot so yeah so then recently i took up like i took out i took on this challenge and i figured why not try making um a borscht that i like and i did some research and i think the two things that i was missing were beef which is not all borsch is made with beef there are a lot of vegetarian versions of borscht and my family tends to make the vegetarian versions but i gotta admit even though i appreciate vegetarian food it's a lot better with beef and then also my secret addition was kimchi which i think really takes porsche to the next level it's great but i also like you i have i have trouble with beats and it sucks because like i beat beets are so beautiful and they're so i mean they're just gorgeous and they're healthy and but like i just i grew up my parents grew beets in the garden and they pickled them and it's just like a child being asked to eat pickled beets is is just asking for lifelong trauma precisely precisely and also like quite similarly mine weren't pickled but i grew up eating a lot of beetroot based food there was a lot of porsche there was a lot of what russians call vinaigrette which has nothing to do with what you think of when you hear vinaigrette it is a beetroot based it's like a imagine a potato salad with sauerkraut and beetroot that would be it oh the ukrainians add sauerkraut and the russians add pickles pickled cucumbers that is um but yeah that's but that's what they call vinaigrette i don't know why um yeah and then there's also like all sorts of like beetroot with uh with with cream to make to make all sorts of like sort of you feel the fish style things like fish with like a layer of like beetroot salad and that kind of stuff and i had so much of this and i gotta say like especially when i was a kid i was not the biggest fan of this the earthy flavor of beetroot these days i can kind of appreciate it do you um i feel bad but like given that like you know people are going to be wondering um you're russian and you're in europe do you want to talk about the thing the thing um sure i can i can talk about the thing um and the thing i mean i i assume you refer you refer to the war in ukraine yeah um which yeah i mean it sucks we have just just like two kilometers from here is berlin's main train station we have like 10 000 plus refugees arriving every day from ukraine um and it's uh it's it's it's rough and like with my family being russian it's even more rough my grandparents are still still around and they're in st petersburg right now and we're like well i don't know because i have dual citizenship so while i until quite recently i was like cool with my grandparents if anything's up i can always fly over hang out with them help out if they need me um but now if i travel to russia i'm i'm like at risk of just being they might not let me out again they're like nope actually you're staying here and you're gonna go and shoot some ukrainians now no not gonna happen so basically i'm cut off from from seeing my grandparents and they're old so what do you do uh that sucks so like it affected my family personally and then obviously on a on a higher level like me and all of my family we hate that there's war and like my grandparents like having grown up in the soviet union and being like sort of in a sense patriotic russians and let's say the best possible like interpretation of the word patriotic but like yeah they're no not nuts or anything so they might have a slightly different view than me about like um how how much of its own nation is ukraine actually like their opinion might differ slightly but not not a ton actually they're definitely not brainwashed but like they but most importantly they just think it's absolutely ridiculous that there's a war between russia and ukraine like it's just unfathomable to them like those like half of my family like the ancestors of my family are they have been born in like eastern europe and ukraine in like the territory of like ukraine belarus and they all moved to russia it's like really it's just such a fluid like region and not just because of the soviet union but like for centuries there was just there are like family connections and everything and it's just absurd that these it's it's like imagine a war between the us and canada like that's probably how absurd that would be has it affected your your work like did you think for a second maybe maybe now isn't a great time to do abortion video it could just be perceived as some sort of political statement or something yeah when i did the borscht video that was still before the invasion happened oh he did like just two yeah just just about like briefly briefly like a week or two before it happened um so but i but it was like already like on the horizon you know like like troops stationed and everything yeah and i did that and like i remember when i wrote the script for the video i made a point of like saying not just saying like this is a russian this is a russian porsche i i made sure to say eastern european staple soup and like very popular in russia and ukraine and these kinds of things yeah yeah i did that i did that in the video i remember because it was like already on the horizon and just the fact that there were troops stationed around ukraine i made sure to to phrase things carefully but yeah like i i had no idea it was going to escalate like that and i probably would not have made that video if i knew there was going to be an actual full-on war but i mean but and now and now oh i mean i had big plans actually for so that borscht video is actually the very reduced version of what i wanted to do for a long time i was actually going to do a very elaborate porsche video where i travel to russia and into ukraine and like because i have the advantage of speaking the language and yeah in ukraine almost everyone speaks russian so i i was like i'm gonna like do a big like research tour about porsche i really wanted to and first there was covet so traveling was difficult and once covet like started like almost being over at least in terms of traveling like you could sort of safely travel yeah then then a war broke out so that fully like cancelled like all the plans i had for a bigger borscht video and i don't think that's going to happen anytime soon i also wanted to do a lot more about russian food which i just can't i'm not i'm i mean i can't but i'm not going to touch russian food for a while now which sucks because that's one of the few foods that i have a deep connection to her you know because my family's from there but yeah not gonna happen not gonna happen so it's like yeah this this this stupid war it has no positive side effects i literally because i i i've been a little i'm a little obsessed with it and very kind of like worried about it and on a number of levels um mostly just because i just i feel like the world has gotten far too unafraid of nuclear war um yeah and uh yeah but anyway so like i watch lots of videos about you know military tactics and stuff that we're learning about what's happening there and i try to like use my um my community channel to just like boost other creators sometimes like just you know whenever someone watches it makes a video that i think is really good and someone else might want to watch it even if it's not food related i'll just post it to my community channel and just say hey this this person is doing something great you should check them out and i it was like not a political video it was just like a cold cold ass military tactics kind of video and like the number of like politically charged posts and everybody who's like accusing me of like being paid by the u.s state department and like all kinds of [ __ ] in the comments and it's just like of course it's hor it's horrifying what this is done to people's brains you know yeah horrifying there's so much because like especially for creators like i i think you are also one of these creators but like correct me if i'm wrong but like you're somebody who likes to talk about food but not just talk about like recipes and how much exactly get into it it's so funny and people just like stick to cooking man it's like when have i ever stuck to cooking like exactly exactly but i think especially for creators like like us then um it's like you wanna you wanna bring more of a like a social dimension and like a kind of like let's connect the dots on like a geopolitical thing uh when it comes to food or something it's like there's just just it's just so dangerous like all like there's a few people who are really gonna appreciate it but then it's gonna spark so much outrage in the comments no matter how carefully you are no matter careful you phrase yourself and it's like actually even if you just stick to food the conversations of like where something is from i mean we all know how toxic those can get right on the other hand though once you once you uh once you have a certain reach people will come to you no matter what type of creator you are like for example like i'm a food crater but now that the war in ukraine broke out i was approached by people and i know they mean well they just probably haven't seen my porsche video but they're like hey you should make a video about borsch and tell people that it's ukrainian and not russian right yeah and like share some ukrainian culture and like like speak out and like share all these links about how to support the ukrainian government and that kind of stuff so at the same time people want you to use your reach to help them spread their sometimes political or social justice ideas but on the other hand once you do that a lot of people will get really unhappy in the comments and that's how a lot of people i think end up just saying you know what [ __ ] it i'm just not going to touch any of this i'm just going to be a super watered down mellow food crater and just live in my peaceful food bubble and not touch anything else i don't know i'm still not convinced i still think that it's a cool thing to try to combine food and other topics but it's uh because they they are connected whether people want them to be or not exactly exactly yeah all right anything else we should talk about can we end on something more fun than that something more fun yeah that's what are you working on currently um i am doing my 16 minute opus on why sheep tastes like sheep that i've been oh that gamey taste you mean yeah yeah i've had this one in the cooker for like months and i'm super excited it's finally kind of coming down what was so much fun is that it's like there's really there's really only one place in the united states where like white people will still eat mutton as like a matter of tradition um and it's and it's owensboro kentucky uh i don't know if you've ever heard about this but like western kentucky has this weird tradition of using uh mutton for barbecue um and and i was just like oh my god it's i was i was like i can't i i want it because i want i had all like the science research for this video done months ago but i was like i just i gotta go to owensboro kentucky man like uh and you know it's it's a six hour drive away but we did a trip where it was vaguely on the way to someplace else and yeah i just like you know left my family in the car they were in an air-conditioned car outside for five minutes i just like ran into this restaurant i ordered a sandwich i like got down in a corner booth and set up like you know my camera and a little pocket light that i have and i just ate this sandwich and it was god it was so great it was so great and then i like and then i walked out and i'm just i'm so happy that like and it's it's this like it's literally like the footage it's like 45 seconds of footage at the end of this video and i drove to owensboro kentucky for it but it was so worth it and i'm just so happy about it it's always like whenever like whenever i put this like unreasonable amount of extra effort into a video i'm always like this is probably stupid because nobody's gonna care but you know what i noticed that these videos do the best long term really they might not be yeah like the videos almost every single there are exceptions but almost every single video that i put like like this extra effort where i went the extra mile that those videos they tend to have the best shelf life they just tend to like bring me like extra subscribers and views and inspire people for like years to come so in a way that shows so in a way that shows um yeah but like i definitely know this feeling of like you're taking this like unreasonably long trip just to taste the sandwich for 45 seconds of footage but it's good i'm looking forward to those 45 seconds quite quite a lot can i ask you something whenever you mentioned mutton um is it true that it's difficult to get veal in the united states it is not as easy to find now as it was when i was young for sure um it used to be a at least in the east at least in the eastern united states it was a pretty common feature on you know fancy menus italian places all had veal something there was usually a small veal section in the in the grocery store and now i can sometimes find veal at the grocery store but um there's usually not like a whole little section there's just like one like one thing will be for sale um which is funny which is funny because it's like the the the backlash against veal was was provoked by legit horrific treatment of veal cavs but what's funny is that it's like the industry really has cleaned itself up a lot um mostly mostly with self-regulation but the damage that they did to themselves is done and people don't want neil and and i don't know how if i really like weep weep for veal i mean even putting aside the even putting aside the humanitarian aspect of it it's like it's do i really want beef that tastes less beefy i don't know do you andong um i don't know i mean i asked about veal specifically because like two things that are very popular to eat here oh hell the schnitzel yeah i mean the schnitzel which is actually austrian so the classic well and then the other thing but that doesn't make it less popular here although like the everyday schnitzel i i will admit it's made from pork in germany because also like a german schnitzel is actually pork and a viennese one is veal but i i'm not gonna split hairs here the the classic is uh veal and then also um i would say the food that people who grow up like me who grew up in berlin eat the most is doing a kebab which is a the rotisserie no not rotisserie like a vertical rotating spit with a layered veal traditionally and that makes like kebab sandwiches that are very delicious and that are of course a turkish thing traditionally but turkish population is huge here in germany and german german food itself is it's not bad but it's not spectacular or like usually not the kind of food you find on instagram a lot i love it though just go well because you know you know about me and acid if you've watched any of my videos and just like yeah yeah yeah so much vinegar so much pickling i love it love it oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah that that we have that we have um but then like it's still like in in real life like traditional german food i'm gonna go out and say that growing up in berlin at least you hardly ever have traditional german food you just have like kind of like modern day global convenience food a lot you know like your pastas and all of that kind of stuff or you have like street food which is going to be a kebab so that's turkish food and it's often made from veal the traditional kebabs so that's what i was asking i was just showing ethan chabowski who visited berlin a few days ago around and we had a couple of donors and he was like yeah veal is not super easy to come by so that's that's why i wanted to ask since we were talking about like meat that is not beef pork or chicken well when there are no longer plagues and wars i look forward to uh getting over there and trying adonai kebab myself please do and i will be happy to show you around adam you gotta subscribe to my name is ondong on youtube he also does short form stuff on instagram and tiktok he's like me but has a much more friendly on-air persona and much better camera work and editing because he works with a whole awesome team of people i just sit in my kitchen by myself and screw things up speaking of which here's how i failed this week i missed two appointments this may sound like not a big deal but it is for me in the sense that once i've missed something i become psychologically incapable of picking it back up again i missed a business meeting with someone at youtube and another meeting with a very important person in book publishing about a potential cookbook project and even though i kind of doubt that a cookbook is a good idea at least in the context of traditional publishing i should not have missed that meeting i had good reasons for missing these appointments i did not just space out on them i've had a lot of extra business stuff going on the last few weeks speaking of which the adam ergucia chef knife sold out in less than a week so thanks so much to everybody who bought one most of them have already shipped the rest should ship out on monday that sale went really well so we're probably gonna make some more and sell them toward the end of the year shipping internationally this time fingers crossed anyway yeah business has been crazy and i've had several business related emergencies to deal with in addition to my normal personal and family responsibilities which are numerous so i missed two meetings it is also the case that i am fundamentally uncomfortable around other people and when i ghost on them i become extra anxious about ever talking to them again the anxiety grows exponentially as the clock ticks following that initial act of ghosting on my part as more and more time passes i become more and more nervous to call them back because i haven't called them back i don't feel i can explain to them why i took so long calling them back so i don't call them back the reason i don't call them back is because i haven't called them back a vicious circle i believe this is called and i really figured that by the time i was 40 damn years old i would have worked through these aspects of my personality and yet here we are i'd like to think that my public confession of this problem will amount to some kind of curative act of catharsis but it probably won't a more realistic goal for this confession is to show you out there especially you young people which is most of you i want to show you that a grown ass adult can be successful both personally and professionally while simultaneously exhibiting some basic social dysfunctions that you would expect from someone who is not grown ass it happens we'll get to answering some of your questions in two seconds but first real quick let me

garlic or salt well i suppose i'd [ __ ] garlic because garlic is a fundamentally sexy substance i would marry salt because salt is indispensable in every sense of the word you need salt in your life for the rest of your life which is what marriage is all about salt is an essential nutrient your body could not function without sodium and chloride ions crucial electrically charged dissolved minerals aka electrolytes aka the things that maintain your blood pressure and your ph which your body does just fine regardless of whether you eat acidic or alkaline diets by the way your body holds a constant ph electrolytes also help carry nerve impulses for muscle contractions and such without them you would lose all control of yourself and the chloride from salt is a real unsung hero your body needs chloride for all of the above and also to make and release stomach acid so sodium chloride is essential which is why i would marry it plus basically all food tastes bad without some amount of salt that does not necessarily mean you have to add salt foods generally contain some amount of salt naturally fruits for example meat too so mary salt because you gotta have it gotta lock that [ __ ] down put a ring on it and i don't wanna kill any of these but i suppose onion is the most dispensable of the three to me so yeah i kill the onion though i would rather not onion is to savory foods as vanilla is to sweet foods at least in western cuisine by that i mean onion is so ubiquitous that you take it for granted you might not even perceive it on a conscious level but if you start leaving it out of recipes you notice real quick and you miss it that's a good idea for a video by the way so thank you aced arts asks what is the best way to hide the body dark clothing and blazers over top to kind of tent around the body and conceal its shape and then what you want are tight shots tight camera angles that only get you from like the chest up basically the steven seagal bag of tricks will be great for hiding the body and before anybody comments yes i know that's not what aced arts was asking i am being rye corlock notes that i was a music major in college and grad school me adam i was but korlock asks as a young music major myself what was your experience with burnout plateauing or just generally feeling like you were not moving forward how did you counter this i didn't corlock i did not counter it i burned out i plateaued and i ceased moving forward in music which i no longer regard as a bad thing you go to school to learn things about the external and the internal to learn things about yourself including what you're good at and what you're not good at i was good at music but i was not great and with the music industry having all but collapsed during my lifetime there is now no room in it for lots of great people let alone is there room for all the people who are good or all the people who are barely passable i tend to think that if you're trying to do something for which there is little to no market then you had better be great at it and obsessed with it and if you're not then you kind of have no business being there there aren't enough seats on that bus for the geniuses so if you're not a genius then i think you should get up and give your seat to one of them now one of the many reasons i think the advice i just gave might be very bad advice is that i think it's very hard to assess whether someone is a genius especially yourself there are many kinds of genius there are genius musicians who've made enormous contributions to the culture while at the same time being truly terrible musicians in at least a few subcategories of assessment people who couldn't carry a tune in a bucket for example and yet they had some other musical ability that changed the world there are lots of kinds of genius that are not immediately forthcoming or are not immediately recognized perhaps because they are novel and what a shame it would be if novel genius never got the chance to express itself especially if it were snuffed out by a pointless war for example the piece of advice that i'm more sure about is to say that education is the process of learning the internal as well as the external and learning what you are not good at is at least as important as learning what you are good at and the only way to learn these things is to try stuff and fail failure is not only okay it is essential to growth in school as well as in the gym get them gains so if you find that you're not actually a music genius then i say stop and do something else you have not wasted any time you learned a lot you hopefully had a lot of fun along the way so be enriched by those experiences and carry those lessons into the next phase of your life that's what i did it got me this far happy asks what's your mic set up and how do you sound so crisp thank you happy i'm not sure that i always sound so crisp i have been liking this new shure sm7b that i bought for the pod corner in the basement this is one of the all-time classic radio microphones in service in some form for half a century now but microphones don't matter nearly as much as the spatial relation between the microphone and the thing you're trying to record and the space in which you are recording so chiefly i sound crispy right now because i'm talking almost right into the mic and i'm in a foamed out corner of my basement my basement that already has wall-to-wall carpet on the floor and acoustical office tile in the ceiling these are all soft irregular surfaces that absorb and or disperse sound waves rather than reflecting them in contrast when i have to record audio in my kitchen that is a total nightmare kitchens are filled with smooth hard surfaces that are easy to clean that's why they're there but they reflect sound waves like whoa so you get tons of nasty echo in the sound when i do my talking head shots in the kitchen where i'm talking to the camera i use this lavalier microphone that i just tape right under my shirt right here and so there's a very short trip between my mouth and the mic that's good and then i take a ton of loose foam panels that i have in the garage and i use them to temporarily coat the wall that is opposite me in those shots that wall is conveniently behind the camera as well so you never see it though if you're curious i recently posted a picture of this to my instagram eragusia on instagram i set up and tear down a whole wall of foam for every talking headshot that i do in the kitchen and even then there's still a ton of echo there are computer programs audio plugins that you can buy for a fair bit of money that claim to be able to eliminate reverberation i think they all suck and sound awful the post-production processing i do use that makes for crisp sound is i roll off the low frequencies that is i filter out almost everything below 150 hertz or so in my voice all those super low frequencies do is make voices sound muddy they do nothing else and i sometimes boost some of the upper mid frequencies at least on my voice i find that helps and i use a lot of compression and in this context compression means processing that makes the quiet moments louder and the louder moments quieter it evens everything out too much compression has made contemporary rock music virtually unlistenable in my opinion but it makes spoken content far easier to listen to rise rampage asks what are your thoughts on the existence of life well i think that life is the inevitable result of organic chemistry life will happen spontaneously anywhere the basic necessary conditions and raw materials are available i suspect the universe is teeming with life and likely intelligent life however i think the spatial and temporal distances between us are so great that we will likely never have any contact with any other intelligent species and that sucks ladnarian rye wants to know what are your religious beliefs i believe religion is a thing invented by humans and when i was young i believed religion to be an overwhelmingly bad thing now as an older person i'm not so sure however it seems to be a natural and inevitable process that as societies get more prosperous and educated religion tends to fade and i think that's just fine and to be expected i do wish that there were more non-religious communitarian institutions available to me we go to my mother-in-law's episcopal church sometimes and i really like many aspects of that and i feel we need to try to retain some form of that in the inevitable post-religion future and finally in a subject closely related to religion j w white j asks are you still on the fence about cast iron or has it grown on you well i like cast iron just fine i think it's a great option for lots of people chiefly as i said in that video because it's the least expensive way to make a really good pan thanks to you dear audience and to the patronage of my sponsors i can afford really good stainless steel cookware now and i generally think that it is superior thanks to globalization though there is very good stainless cookware on the market now that is not that much more expensive than cast iron so the company meizen has sponsored me in the past but this is not a sponsored message i'm saying this right now because i think it's true i think they make some really good stainless pieces that are not that much more expensive than cast iron and a good heavy stainless steel pan works great and is far easier to clean and to care for especially in a humid climate like the one that i live in stuff rusts much easier in humid air i do have a 100 year old 10 inch cast iron piece from alabama that my dear friend david ragsdale restored and gave to me several years ago he has a side business that you can patronize it's called what's up homer skillet just google that what's up homer skillet and he's got a ton of beautiful historic pieces restored that you can buy and i love that cast iron pan and i use it all the time but we have to be honest that the non-stick coating you get by seasoning a cast iron or high carbon steel pan is nowhere remotely as effective as teflon so when i really need non-stick i reach for the one good teflon pan that i have for that purpose it's like a specialist there are good and bad reasons to want to avoid teflon a bad reason would be you're worried that it's bad for your health it probably isn't i have a whole video about that that you could search for and watch a good reason to avoid teflon is the factories that make it deposit lots of potentially harmful chemicals into the environment i'm really not sure if the total environmental impact of a cast iron pan is better than that of a teflon pan but i think it might be so yeah that's a reason to not use teflon but of course you do use teflon even if you don't cook in it teflon and some related nonstick coatings are ubiquitous in consumer products it's in your electronics it's in your clothes it's in your furniture cosmetics packaging you may have seen a news story in the last week about the non-stick coatings on fast food wrappers the grease proof paper that they wrap your burger in consumer reports published an investigation on those so-called pfas chemicals are potentially harmful in the human body and consumer report says they found them in concerning levels in some big name fast food wrappers as i understand it contemporary non-stick cookware is unlikely to have any meaningful amount of pfas on or in it however those chemicals are involved in the production process back at the factory for those pans and thus they do pose an environmental hazard i think those are good enough reasons to minimize use of nonstick cookware that's why i just keep one around and i pretty much only use it for eggs and the occasional fish and i use it because as great as a great cast iron pan is a seasoning coat is nothing compared to teflon in the non-stick department but i thank you for sticking around this far into the show get it i tried to make this episode a little shorter and tighter than the previous episodes and i tried moving the segment order around a bit let me know if you liked it better this way for audience q a for the time being i am only accepting questions on the apple podcasts app leave a rating and a review there that helps other people find the show and when you leave a real review also put in a question and i will respond to the ones that i find interesting there are some more good ones in there

squarespace of all the fancy cuts of meat out there lamb shanks might be the easiest to cook pretty much anything you do to them will work as long as you go low and slow people often braise them my preference is to slow roast them takes about four hours so this is a weekend dinner for sure but most of that time is unattended i made these with a celery root puree and this roasted garlic lamb sauce that is possibly the best sauce i've ever made lamb shanks if you can't get them or you don't like that lamby flavor you could totally do this with beef shanks beef shanks are generally cut into bone-in steaks but because lambs are smaller these are basically full shin bones and you don't have to do any home butchery to them at all the bone will clean itself in the oven i know what you're thinking didn't he just post a video where he says he never cuts himself in the kitchen well i don't this was a woodworking accident or let's call it a poor choice i'll just grease these shanks up with some olive oil and season them generously there's a lot of meat here i'm doing salt pepper and mustard powder i like mustard with lamb now for the garlic sauce we need garlic you could just throw a bunch of whole peeled cloves into that roasting tray but i'm going to do the thing where you cut the top off of a whole head make sure that every clove has an escape hatch at the top that's not very fresh you can tell by the green cores i think i'll do two heads roasted garlic is not pungent in the way that garlic normally is so you can use a lot of it i'll throw those in there and get everything coated with oil and seasoning out of an abundance of caution i'll position the garlic heads underneath the shank so that they don't burn under the broiler if your oven doesn't have a grill you could just blast them at maximum baking temperature for a few minutes or just skip this step we're going to brown them again at the end but i think browning them a little bit up front results in better flavor across the whole dish i'll flip those and give them another couple of minutes under the broiler shanks have such an irregular shape it's much easier to brown them in the oven rather than frying them off in a pan alrighty that was just five minutes of browning broiler off i'll get everything even in the roasting tray and if i were gonna braise these i would put in some liquid maybe halfway up the meat but i'm gonna be slow roasting so no extra liquid i'll just seal this up pretty tight with foil to trap some steam and keep them from drying out throw that in the oven and i'm doing 285 fahrenheit 140c anything in that general neighborhood will work celery root or celeriac it's also called if you like the flavor of celery this makes a shockingly delicious mashed potato-like puree it is much more work than mashed potatoes so maybe just make mashed potatoes but if you want to try this step one is peel the skins are very tough and thick so it takes a while honestly one big celery root would have been enough for this meal but i've got two once peeled i'm gonna slice these pretty thin celeriac is very hard to cook it reasonably quickly you gotta break it down into the smallest pieces you can manage i might just try grating it on a box grater check how hard that bigger one is keep your fingers well out of the way now i'll stack up a few slices at a time and match stick these this gets us plenty of surface area and that'll help these cook quicker and really just to make them easier to stir around i'll cross cut them a little bit to get a very rough dice good enough it's getting pureed in the end a pan big enough for the job and i'll melt in a fair bit of butter there are probably easier ways of cooking celeriac but i'm basically doing this famous recipe by chef raymond blanc the first thing he does is cook the pieces in some butter for a while with this huge quantity i'm going to have to use high heat and stir constantly this phase gets some really nice flavor on the pieces and gives them a good head start on cooking after about 10 minutes they've reduced in volume by maybe a third and things are starting to turn brown which i don't want so what raymond blanc does is simmer them in milk you could use water but milk tastes really nice you want just enough to get the pieces covered pieces that are really exposed will oxidize and turn brown then you just turn the heat down to low cover and gently simmer until soft which can take a real long time okay this is going to look kind of gross but have faith the milk has curdled and that's just fine it's great even those curds are going to give us amazing flavor the celeriac chunks are soft i simmered those about an hour which is honestly more than they needed but i was busy elsewhere riemann blanc tells you to lift the chunks out of the liquid with a slotted spoon i'm just pouring the liquid out instead that is almost entirely whey that has separated from the milk save it for now then dump the solids into the food processor this is not a potato it's basically impossible to mash smooth by hand sorry i steamed your face there blast that for a while until it's as smooth as you can get it depending on how it's looking you might need to mix in a little of your reserved liquid to thin it out time to flavor it with salt and the magic ingredient which is a little cayenne or any dried chili powder works amazing with this and blanc calls for a squeeze of lemon if you've got it it tastes good and it'll help keep the puree from oxidizing and turning brown it might not be the prettiest stuff in the world but it is so sweet and nutty and rich tasting despite having very little butter compared to how i would normally make mashed potatoes alrighty my lamb shanks have been slow roasting for about four hours and see the bone cleans itself just by touching the meat i can see it's fall apart tender my garlic is golden and totally soft we're done and you can totally eat these just like that they'd be great but i'm going to remove them to a baking sheet at this stage you could refrigerate them and finish them later i'm just going to hold them for a few minutes while i make my sauce and then roast them again for a few minutes totally dry to crisp the surface sauce take the garlic out to let it cool and depending on how many shanks you did and how big your roasting tray is you may or may not have a lot of juice in here along with all that rendered fat if you can see two distinct layers of liquid like that that means you have a lot of water-based meat juice in there along with the fat and i like to turn the heat on and boil most of that water out just takes a few minutes in a tray this wide eventually you'll hear the pan go from a boiling sound to more of a fizzing frying sound that means most of the water is gone you can see meat solids floating around in the grease and browning and that's enough with the water out i can very easily pour off the rendered fat while keeping the tasty stuff that was dissolved in the juice right there in the pan where i want it roast some potatoes in that lamb fat another day now that my garlic has cooled a bit i can squeeze it out of the skins compared to normal garlic roasted garlic is like a totally new substance it's this sweet silky goo you can spread on toast or use as a sauce base heat back on and normally i would use white wine to deglaze this pan but i have this incredibly flavorful celery whey here might as well use that i'm just holding back any leftover curds that have settled on the bottom of the jug if you need more liquid just use water you could just use water period there's plenty of flavor in here already scrape the pan to get all the solids dissolved and mash up the garlic to a smooth paste you could totally finish this sauce as is but if you need it to be really smooth and pretty for your thumbnail yeah you could strain it through a sieve this is really pointless and i feel bad for doing it don't bother straining it this is purely cosmetic i can return this to the pan but it's in a heat safe bowl so i might as well finish it in here i just want to melt in quite a bit of butter with just enough heat to melt it nice and slowly monte auber they say there should be little or no bubbling too much heat and you break the natural emulsion of the butter with the emulsion intact we have thickened our sauce we've enriched it and we've increased our overall sauce volume i'll give that a taste doesn't need any more salt but it needs acid and i happen to have another half of that lemon from before so in it goes between the lamb fond and the milky celeriac broth and the roasted garlic and everything that is probably the most extraordinary sauce i've ever made myself i'll throw the shanks back in the oven to reheat and brown a little i might turn the oven up to like 400 fahrenheit 200c real quick i'll steam some broccolini which is not to be confused with the visually similar broccoli rob broccoli rob is very bitter this is very sweet after a couple of minutes it's just barely fork tender pulled the steamer basket out i love that steamer basket dump the water melt in a little butter broccoli back in pinch of salt toss there's our veg and here's our shanks i just think there's so much more appetizing if you dry out the surface for a few minutes and get them a little crispy the celery root puree i literally just reheated in the microwave totally fine this shank really is not as much food as it looks like most of the mass here is bone and some other inedible stuff it's a perfectly reasonable single portion you might even want to make one or two extra shanks in case you got some small ones time for that sauce i think you want to get that sauce tasting a little too acidic on its own because you need that acid to cut the richness of this meat lamb shanks have a lot of fat in them which is why you can slow roast them without drying them out when you braise them in extra liquid i think they can come out too moist like a wet mop these are perfect inside still pink because we use such a gentle oven temperature yeah i think you should probably just make mashed potatoes but give raymond blanc celeriac puree a try sometime it is a whole nother thing delicious and like i said you could do this recipe with beef shanks they might take a little longer in the oven but they'd be way cheaper why is sheep so expensive at least here in the u.s and why are certain people turned off by its distinct and powerful flavor we'll talk about that another day what

My old video about ""knife skills,"" specifically the claw grip and why I think it's unnecessary...",2022-11-24 14:47:05.183328, hello my name is Adam ragusia I am not a chef I am a guy in his kitchen with a camera and as such I do not wield my knife like a trained Chef I use it like a normal person because I am and I'm now going to show you the normal person strategies I've used through the years to convert my Foods into multiple smaller foods without cutting myself I can't remember the last time I cut myself in the kitchen I mean I burned myself all the time but I never cut myself hey is that the new Adam ragusia custom chef knife available for purchase at adamregusia.com maybe we'll start with an onion nearly every Savory recipe on Earth starts with peel and chop an onion how exactly does one do that step one is get off the papery skin if you want to make whole slices of onion you have to make a very shallow cut across the outer layer and then peel but if you're going to chop the onion you might as well just cut it in half to begin with now it's way easier to reach under any undesirable outer layers and peel them off you still have this inedible bit of stem at the top to slice off I swear if someone comments oh that's not a stem it's a tunic or Escape or whatever I will think of a Snappy reply to you and then I will never post it you've been warned at this point I like to stop and clear away all of the inedible bits before I actually start chopping with the exception of the root end you have to leave that because it holds all the layers together as you're cutting through them the first thing I'm going to show you is I think a more traditional way of chopping an onion I do it sometimes just slice straight down from the top almost all the way to the bottom but not quite again you want to leave that base intact so that all the concentric layers are held in place for you while you work slice straight down to the board that's the traditional part nice and slow nice and careful as far as you can go at this stage I have seen classically trained chefs make some cuts through the onion this away I just don't think it's really worth the trouble just cross cut the slices and your pieces fall away now time out grip most of the time I favor the pinch grip which is very common very popular very natural I suppose the most natural thing to do would be just hold it by the handle like a sword I mean that's what the handle is there for but I think most people find it with a chef knife and not a sword you get a lot more control if you actually grab the blade of the knife a little bit so you take your two fingers here and you grip them around the knife here and then your middle finger hangs out right behind the heel right there and the rest of your hand is on the handle that's the pinch grip or a basic variation of the pinch grip works really good for me it's frowned upon but sometimes I do find myself using the pointer grip where the finger comes out on the spine of the knife there the first finger there I find that I sort of do this naturally when I need to have a little bit of extra control over the tip that's for very specialized situations I almost never do this generally I'm back here it's a good grip and note how the knife moves forward as it simultaneously moves down knives generally work a lot better when they move across two axes at once slice forward and chop down at the same time that's particularly good for onions because it's gentle and doesn't spray as much onion gas up into your face cutting in two directions it once might require me to move a little slower but that's just fine I am not a professional I don't have to mow through a whole bag of onions I only have to do one so slow is fine discard that root and there we are totally good enough however it is of course not optimal to use Square grid like cuts to cut something that is not a cube but is rather a sphere a set of concentric spheres you're just going to get a really uneven assortment of shapes when you put a round thing through a square cutter which is essentially what we've just done and I don't think that really matters for a home cook but let's pretend for a second that it does this now is the onion chopping technique that I have used for decades at this point it's just what I kind of do naturally and it would be totally impractical and indeed dangerous for somebody who had to work really fast for a professional who has to go through a bunch of onions I don't have to do that I can go slow and this is what I do slice from the top almost down to the bottom at an angle instead of straight down repeat and just orbit around the natural curvature of the onion that part isn't unconventional lots of people do this but usually with only one quarter of an onion at a time because the problem arises when your orbit takes you to the other hemisphere over here and now to keep making these Cuts I have to start cutting away from my body and indeed toward my hand again this would be stupid dangerous if I were going fast but I'm not and I think I've got it under control just because you can't do a u-turn at 100 miles per hour it doesn't mean you should never do a U-turn just slow down it'll be fine and if you wanted little Half Moon bits of onion you could at this point just slice off the root end and they would fall apart into these perfect little frenched onions they're called but I'm gonna go for a chop or a dice or whatever anybody calls pieces of these General dimensions in there check how much more uniform those pieces are not that I think it really matters but this is just something I do so I'm showing it to you that's how I cut onions now yes I am the guy who made a video called you don't need knife skills but if you watch that video you know that I was talking about something very specific one particular technique that is kind of the foundation of what professional chefs generally call knife skills and that is the claw grip if you want an expert demonstration of the claw grip watch somebody else because I don't use it but the basic idea is you put the tips of your fingers on the food and then the side of the knife actually makes contact with your knuckles as you cut this stabilizes the knife and pushes The Cutting Edge away from your fingertips if you do it right it's virtually impossible to cut yourself I'm sure the claw grip is essential for professionals who need to do what I would call a running chop where the knife never stops moving right when you're a professional you need to realize some economies of scale if you can shave 35 seconds off of an operation that you do a hundred times a night that's an hour that you have just saved on your shift like that's a big deal but when I'm just doing that operation once or twice a night here in my home there's no economy of scale for me to realize by going that fast and thus I just don't think this is necessary for me I simply don't need to put in the time it takes to master this very safe very effective but very unnatural and awkward maneuver known as The Claw grip the human hand is not evolved to hold stuff down like that it's evolved to do this press down flat with the big pads of the fingers instead of the little fingertips yes my fingertips are out in the open in a place where I could slice through them which is why my knife is way far away from my fingers way far away from my stabilizing hand and as the food gets shorter and shorter and I gradually have to get closer to my stabilizing fingers I just slow way down it's a walking chop not a running chop I'm resetting the knife carefully for every single cut I only have one bunch of spring onions to slice today so it's fine if it takes me an extra 30 seconds I'm not a professional cook nor do I need to try to imitate a professional cook to make you think that I'm a badass I am a badass at other things in life I don't need to be a badass at this that said there are some cutting jobs here in the home kitchen that do like legit scare me and where I think some more considered and deliberate technique is warranted an example would be the cutting of hard round things like carrots hard things are inherently more dangerous because they require more force and round things are more dangerous because they roll if you push hard and then the carrot rolls out from under you your knife could go flying and Lord knows what direction so well I'm not a fan of the claw grip I am a fan of what you could call the clamp grip when cutting hard around things I clamp my hand above and around the knife pinch the carrot super tight super stable and then cut through now the pieces are flat and flat things are more stable and safe to cut if you have a round thing to cut get it flat as soon as you can just cut those in half and now I can cross cut some nice quarter slices it's a very safe or easy way to break down a carrot say you want a diced or brunoise carrot here I think is the easiest and safest way for a person with normal human skills to approximate a brunoise here's how I do it clamp the carrot and then cut it in half as before lay it on its nice stable flat side and just make thin slices long ways I have to get my fingers very close to the blade toward the end there which is why I'm just going very slow walk don't run then I'll go back and very imprecisely cut the wider pieces into more narrow matchsticks or julienne the culinary school types have far more precise ways of doing this that get them perfect tiny squares for me I don't think it's worth the effort or the waste if I cross cut those I think that's good enough but time out notice how when it was time to rotate the cutting angle I rotated the food rather than rotating myself see I moved the food instead of contorting my body into an unnatural position to change the cutting angle that is good I think it's the right thing to do move the food around you I mentioned this because I've noticed that in my recipe videos I sometimes cut things at a somewhat unnatural and uncomfortable and probably not the safest angle and why do I do that well because I'm not just cooking in here I'm making videos right so so I have other things I have to worry about I have to worry about like lines of sight like am I getting my hand or the knife in the way of what the camera is seeing am I blocking light am I creating a shadow that's making it hard for you to see what you need to see oh I am well I guess I can reach that my camera angle but oh now like my kid is in the background of the shot picking his nose at the kitchen table right like so I just have more things to worry about and sometimes I just kind of say screw it and I just move my body rather than resetting the whole shot because that's going to solve the problem for me from a shooting perspective but I'm probably not modeling really good you know practices for you and so I'm going to try to stop doing that anyway soup I guess I'm making a big pot of vegetable soup today I really have no other choice I think another particularly hazardous job in the kitchen is to cut things with smooth tough skins like tomatoes or their Botanical cousins the peppers lately with bell peppers I've been favoring this technique where you hold the pepper really securely by its stem and then you just fillet the sides of meat right off of the fibrous CD core nice now here's the problem my knife could easily slip off of that skin and I could cut myself so what I might do is flip the piece around my knife will bite much more easily into the flesh side here and as soon as it bites it's held stable by the food on either side of it of course the problem here is that the piece is unstable on its rounded skin side it rocks back and forth it's more stable if I flip it back around but then I have to deal with the slippery skin problem I have no idea which is the better way so if I've given conflicting advice about how to cut peppers in the past this is why I'm just really not sure I go back and forth on it something that I talked about in the previous video that I made about knife skills is that there really is no scientific research about what kinds of cutting tends to result in injuries in a home kitchen context there's a little bit of research from the Occupational Health Science field looking at like people cutting in like meat packing plants but that's really the extent of it and it's not really applicable here so anybody who tells you to do something because it's going to keep you safe is not speaking from science they're speaking from their own anecdotal experience and that includes me just doing the best we can which is why I think the best advice is to just do what and natural for you and Joe when you do it again slicing across as you chop down does help the knife bite through that slippery layer of skin and that's good in the Soup pot with you garlic people have so many ways of peeling and chopping garlic and I've like tried all of them and I've tried all the gizmos I put 10 million cloves of garlic into nearly everything I cook and for what it's worth this is the method that I just keep coming back to lay the head on the board root side up and smack it now that I have a clove free I will trim off its root end that root end is just kind of yucky plus it's very firmly attached to the skin so cut it off then I lay the knife over the clove and smack the side this breaks the connection between the skin and the clove allowing you to pick the skin out it also pre-chops the clove a little bit for you but there's still some work to do I'm rocking the knife back and forth pretty fast because look my other hand is nowhere near this whole mess it doesn't need to be there's nothing to stabilize I'll just bring it over to you know wipe the garlic off the knife every now and then so I can get to chopping it again people ask me all the time why don't you use a garlic press or one of the other gizmos that are out there for doing this and you know I have a garlic press and I used to use it every now and then but I can really find myself never touching it anymore because I just figured look I'm cooking the board is already dirty the knife is already dirty I'm already here I might as well just use what I've already got out instead of getting out a whole other thing that I'm going to have to wash I got two other really quick tips I want to show you broccoli turn the crown upside down and then just cut down to release the florets you spiral around the crown doing that one florette at a time way easier than any other method I've seen and when you get down to the stem you can slice that up and eat it if you want I usually do and the last tip concerns soft thin things like herbs these can be hard to cut because there just isn't enough for the knife to bite into so what people usually do is stack the leaves or Bunch them up real tight and then the knife is so much more secure it has more to grab a hold of in the soup with you dear Lord promise me that if you've not done so already you will at least try making vegetable soup by just cutting up whatever vegetables you have and boiling them in some plain water with a bunch of salt and a bunch of vinegar it's easily one of my top five favorite things to eat as long as I've got some tomatoes in there too I swear this is as good and cheap and easy as it is nutritious and yes time to acknowledge the elephant in the room the new custom Adam ragusia eight inch chef knife for sale now at adamregocia.com my associate Colin and I have been working on this project for over a year I am so happy with how it turned out this is everything I have ever wanted in a knife it's everything I have ever recommended to people who were going out there trying to find their first good knife go ahead and Google this particular German steel we've used you will see that it's a great steel for kitchen knives maybe not the best certainly not the most expensive but it's probably the best steel you can get that is easy to own and by that I mean it is particularly resistant to tarnish and corrosion and it is easy to sharpen so this is hard feel hard enough that it can get a really really sharp edge on it it's tough but it's not so hard that it chips easily it's not so hard that it becomes technically challenging to sharpen just like you know a decent pull through multi-stage home sharpener should do just fine for you to get a really really sharp edge on this thing and of course having a sharp knife is the number one knife skill that there is it makes everything easier and a sharp knife is how people don't cry when they cut onions the blade shape is a pretty standard East-West German Japanese hybrid shape which I think has become incredibly popular for a reason it's the best of all worlds and the lack of a western style bolster at the heel makes it way easier to sharpen I hate bolsters so my knife does not have one my knife does however have a Full Tang which is an inherently funny term but what it means is that the knife the steel here extends all the way down into the handle and through the handle out the other end and out both sides this is all one integrated single piece of Steel which is a very solid kind of construction and it also helps make the handle heavy which I think is really really important this is an early prototype that we did you know gosh almost a year ago and it's good but it was just too light it just kind of threw off the balance it felt a little cheap in the hand and it just and substantial and kind of delicate and not safe so we decided to spend the extra money we added I think 30 grams of weight to the handle here and boy it just makes all the difference in the world it feels so solid in the hand the handle itself is Paco wood which is basically high-tech plywood it's an engineered wood it's very sustainable and it should last a very long time Lauren and I have been using this specific knife at home as our main kitchen knife for like six months now and you can see it's holding up great the handle is blue because that is my favorite color I will say when you get it from the factory it's almost like blinding blue but it calms down it tones down after you wash it a couple of times and of course it's got vinegar leg is on the right on the right and some other details over here on the left wall don't run hey that's good advice and check out this guy on the end cap I know him these markings are all laser engraved and should last a real long time it comes in a fun custom box so it's very giftable price is 70 U.S which is a little bit more than some knives of comparable quality that are on the market but you know this is kind of like a limited run Boutique thing in fact we only made a thousand of these with the initial production run and the fewer you make the higher your costs are per knife so seventy dollars is what we're going with and yes only a thousand of these are in existence right now they're for sale at adamreugustia.com Linked In the description I suspect will sell out pretty quick and I'm so sorry but we are only shipping in the United States for now don't ask why it's a whole thing but we're hopeful that if this goes well if people seem to really want to buy this knife then we can do another production run and then hopefully sell internationally in the future and for Pete's sake just make some vegetable soup just cut stuff up and boil it the salt and the vinegar make everything pop and come alive in a little raw olive oil at the end on top is delicious and it aids in the absorption of fat soluble vitamins but you've probably heard me say that before because you're a Super Fan which is why I put our little inside joke on our knife I hope you like it,3

Thanks to Seed for sponsoring this episode!...",2022-11-24 14:47:05.183328, i'm adam rogocia and here's how i failed this week i forgot to hit record i was filming a recipe for cinnamon rolls and baking recipes are typically pretty easy to shoot or at least they are not very stressful to shoot because they move so slowly they're hard to shoot because it's hard to expose for flour flour is too bright for cameras and i'm not the only food youtuber to report that problem but at least baking recipes move slowly which gives you lots of time to set up your shots and to deal with problems like the flower being too reflective everything was going swimmingly with the cinnamon rolls i mixed the pre-ferment dough i let it rise i mixed the rest of the dough together and let that rise for a couple of hours i went and did my workout while i was waiting and everything was on schedule for me to finish the rolls around 2 15 thus giving me just enough time to walk down and pick up the older kid from school i pulled the fully risen dough out i rolled it thin and right when i was about to smear it with melted butter i had to do a battery swap on the camera so i stopped recording put in the new battery set up the shot again smeared on the butter scattered on the cinnamon sugar filling and that's when i realized i never resumed recording after the battery swap this has happened to me before i don't know why i just phrased that passively as though someone else is doing it to me that's not true i do this to myself i forget to hit record sometimes and sometimes that's fine because i can just hit record and do it again whatever it was but with the cinnamon rolls i had missed an irreversible step there was no way for me to scrape the filling off of the dough so that i could put it back on again i know that because i tried i couldn't just do it again on another dough because i did not have another dough it had taken me almost four hours to make that dough including the fermentation time so i had a total come apart where i might have thrown a chair i didn't throw a chair i put it down very hard and lauren came in and asked me what's wrong and i told her and she said it's okay and i said it's not okay and she said well it has to be and i said don't yell at me for being upset and i didn't actually say that i yelled that much louder than she had yelled the first thing and that was probably my biggest failure that day with the second biggest being that i forgot to hit record when i smeared on the butter i concluded my little come-apart i resumed filling the rolls i rolled them i cut them got them in the oven and while they baked i started getting a second dough going i shot the rolls coming out of the oven i shot the icing all of that done and then hours later just as i was losing the natural light in the kitchen for the day my second dough had fully risen i rolled it out the shape and surface texture of it was noticeably different from the first dough which you can see in the video if you look closely and when i'm smearing the butter on the dough in the video that is the stand-in dough that is the dough from four hours later that is the stunt doe filling in for the crucial shot for which i forgot to hit record and lauren said she was sorry she yelled at me and i said i was sorry i yelled at her because we're pretty good at saying sorry these days as long as she says it first and i turned 40 this week thanks to everybody who said something nice about that this episode two of the adam erguccia podcast is sponsored by monk pack monk

they're keto friendly if you're into that fair bit of protein lots of healthy fats from all the nuts all the almonds and pumpkin seeds and everything and they taste like fancy sophisticated candy bars

right here by my dear friend ben harrison you'll hear us recapping the 1996 movie big night we're going to recap food related movies on this new podcast from time to time and today is one of those times we're going to recap big night and you'll hear me comment on the fact that an italian chef in this movie is being played by a non-italian actor and you will hear my friend ben describe said casting choice as an incidence of olive face in reference to the purportedly olive complexion of southern italian such as myself i think that's a pretty funny joke and i feel bad that i just spoiled it for you but i want to talk about it i want to analyze the joke which of course is the worst thing you can ever do to a joke ben's impromptu coinage of olive face is a reference to blackface which is a name for a real thing that is not funny blackface is an actual problem olive face is not an actual problem which is why it's funny and why isn't it a real problem why is it okay for non-italians to play italians why is it okay for people to make crude stereotypes about italians and italian americans such as myself why is it cool for nintendo to have their new york italian american plumber character say things like whatever he says not my mario mario didn't talk there was no real sound samples in the nes so mario didn't talk i don't know when mario started talking but i do not approve though that is not because of the italian-american stereotypes those are fine i just don't like that mario talks at all why isn't olive face broadly regarded as offensive it's not offensive to me or almost anyone else because there is no evidence that italian americans are being significantly harmed by the stereotypes applied to us that's why italian-americans are not struggling for authentic representation in media we're doing fine thanks true this was not always quite the case when impoverished dark-skinned devoutly catholic southern italian immigrants like my great-grandparents started flooding into the united states a country then dominated by protestants of northern european descent these italians were met with de facto and some de joure discrimination and even some violence some lynchings but the scale of this treatment was nothing in comparison to the horrors that white americans visited upon black americans during the same period and in the period before and in the period after italian-americans did fine the political and economic power they were quickly able to amass and wield was and is enormous the establishment of columbus day as a holiday in the u.s is hardly the most important piece of evidence of italian-american power but it is the most emblematic piece they said hey we southern italian immigrants we are not foreigners in america we discovered america and white anglo-saxon protestant america said oh yeah let's make columbus day a holiday as a gesture of inclusion to italians despite the fact that christopher columbus was genoese born in northern italy and his adult life really had a lot more to do with present-day spain and portugal and despite the fact that he never actually set foot in the present-day united states despite the fact that he never in his whole life accepted that this is not asia and despite the fact that he didn't discover there were already people with advanced civilizations living here and despite the fact that he was a murderer and a kidnapper and a slaver and his governorship of hispaniola was considered appallingly brutal and tyrannical by the monarchs back in spain who sent him there in the first place and who themselves knew a thing or two about brutality and tyranny yeah sure let's declare columbus day that would be the enlightened and inclusive thing to do those white anglo-saxon protestants said at the time i think about that often when i think about my own moral certitude in my own time i wonder if the beliefs that seem enlightened to me now will always be regarded as such anyway google it italian americans today are significantly richer than the average american they're more educated higher status all of that there's really no evidence that italian americans are harmed or oppressed by the culture at large which is why olive face isn't a thing and nobody is trying to cancel nintendo for that stupid mario voice nor should they the accent is fine the fact that mario talks at all is not fine but that's just my opinion and why did i feel the need to voice any of these opinions i laid out just now well because i think it's important for us to say to spell out why some things are okay and why some things aren't okay in our own estimation i think it's really bad when we just assume that all right thinking people know what's what they know why that's offensive well maybe they don't and maybe you don't maybe you've never had to think it through because you've never had to defend your beliefs to anyone or maybe you're wrong maybe i'm wrong maybe nintendo should be cancelled and blackface is hilarious innocent fun if you believe that fine i mean not fine you you're wrong especially about the blackface thing it is not fun and innocent but at least i told you why i believed that to be true i spelled out my reasoning i didn't just assume that it was obvious to anyone with any moral center at all and maybe my reasoning will persuade you and maybe not i don't know i just know that olive face is a really funny joke keep one timpano in the oven for louis prima our recap of stanley tucci's big night is coming up next this episode of the regula pod is sponsored by seed seed daily symbiotic which is a two in one pre and probiotic this is the first in a pipeline of clinically studied next-generation products for gut health whenever i talk about gut health i feel it's important to emphasize that the research on the subject is still in a relatively early phase and seed is totally cool with me saying that right now but the research is really promising and exciting these little capsules contain 24 clinically and scientifically studied strains of bacteria to support gastrointestinal health i have some problems in that area that i'm not going to spell out for you but i have absolutely experienced relief in my first few weeks of taking seed there's reason to believe the bacteria in here can support skin health micronutrient synthesis in your gut can support gut immune function and the capsules themselves are very cleverly designed for like actual bioavailability there's an inner capsule and an outer capsule all with the aim of delivering like actual live probiotics to the end of the small intestine another cool thing is that they come in this really heavy sturdy glass jar that you can reuse all of your refills just come in a little compostable bag i

regucia for 15 off your first month supply thank you seed benjamin harrison and adam pranica are professional star trek episode recappers and i love that i live in a time and place where that actually is a job held by more than one person ben and adam have two very successful podcasts on the maximum fun network there's the greatest generation where they started out recapping star trek the next generation and they've since moved on through ds9 and into voyager now their other podcast is the greatest discovery where they started out recapping star trek discovery but have since moved on to review all of the new trek shows that the trek industrial complex is pumping out right now ben and adam are smart and funny they cook they're both former filmmakers by trade and they love talking about movies of all kinds and they are kind enough now to help me debut a new segment on the pod where we will review food related movies the segment is called food on film while the adam regucia podcast does not yet have theme music food on film has theme music that i'm about to play it is a stupid little song called no weather in california a song that literally came to me in a dream and i woke up and i thought that would be a good theme song for like a movie review podcast and now i kind of have a movie review podcast so roll the theme music for food on film there is no weather in california [Applause] can't be a song about the rain try hollywood dear but i warn you you'll be home we're big fans of yours and you made the music for our show so uh we're uh this is like this is symbiosis man it almost undersells you made the music for our show like you've made the music for many of our shows many of the the versions of our shows we've made like single-episode one-off podcasts that you've made entire suites of theme music for we'll see that that was back when i had like a straight job and uh i had no creative outlets you know and uh now that you do we can't get you on the phone anymore so we are here to discuss boy you know one surely one of the most foodie food films of all time right i can't imagine a more foodie film yeah i mean this doesn't even have a thief or a wife in it just got cooks oh i got it right yes it does have lovers and love yes the the uh the interrelation between the food making and lovemaking arts is very much foregrounded in this film have you ever had like like i love i love cooking i love putting on a big feast like i'm usually taking lead on thanksgiving both of things like that i cannot imagine like like knocking off in the middle of prepping a big thanksgiving feast and going and having sex twice and then coming back to the kitchen and taking it over the line that's right you want to go low and slow both in the kitchen and in the bedroom if right if that's your plan for thanksgiving yeah but is it not implied that at least one of those bangs is is business right that uh that segundo has to have i mean has to has to have sex with isabella rossolini right because there's a he needs it for his business there's some kind of business exchange there which is why he would do the unthinkable of having sex with isabella rossolini the the unthinkable and yet the thinkable i've thought about the unthinkable and the all i can think about right right i mean like thinking about the size and beauty of this kitchen and then all of the uh making out with minnie driver and isabella rossellini that stanley tucci the writer and co-director of this film gets to do it all starts to crystallize what he was up to there's certainly films where it's like there's a male auteur who definitely the whole exercise is just like i can't get beautiful women to kiss me in real life so i'm gonna make a movie right where that happens necessarily on the other hand though like the touch 35 years old tooch with hair and the slicked back widow's peak that tootch kinetic yeah yeah that's a that's an anti-pasto if ever there was one i suppose we just started the beginning the camera opens uh on a a young italian waiter sauntering into work and no it's not an italian waiter it is latin heartthrob marc anthony yeah i watched this with my wife and she was like that guy looked just like mark anthony it was like i got news for you i had exactly the opposite conversation with my wife ben which was which was hey that's marc anthony and she's like oh oh i thought you were going to say she was like no way no i had exactly the opposite interaction with my wife than you had with yours well it's demonstrated that your wife likes tall men because you are very tall and mark anthony is not yeah i guess not he's he's hardly as tall as the broom he's pushing at the end of the film he's he's a he's a he's a fun size he's pocket um and uh i i looked it up and he had not crossed over into english language pop stardom at this point i mean he was huge in spanish language i wonder why he why he wanted to do this yeah the unspeaking role it it's um he's kind of the r2d2 of the film right like it's sort of ever present in the sense how else yeah and that uh he has like a little uh torch that comes out yeah retractable thing is coming after him all the time to provide the deus ex machina right i thought he was great i thought his performance was really was really fun he had so many great little moments where he's he's just in the corner of a frame doing something that catches your eye and really like adds to the texture of the film when he puts his jacket on many driver at the end you're like you marc anthony don't do that don't get involved in this well especially given that like he has to like reach up above his head like he's you know doing a military practice he's like he's dressing a mannequin i don't think of minnie driver as being a particularly statuesque woman but she really towers over just about everyone else she's statuesque in every sense of that term in this film like when she walks out of the sea like she walks into the sea out of frustration at the end of the film and it's it made me because my wife whenever she's very frustrated with the situation she just says i just want to walk into the sea is that inspired by this film i i don't know i don't think she's seen it i feel like she does that trick like where you hit an elevator and you're standing behind a couch and you go down like like she's in very shallow water there because when she finally stands up she just basically like straightens her legs mini driver could do mime mini driver can do anything yeah this is kind of uh like the the baywatch people use this technique a lot like a lot of the rescues are meant to be taking place like way out in the in the in the waves and they're just in like 13 inches of surf well the insurance company you know it's right he's got to do it exactly so mark anthony saw saunters into work into the most spacious professional kitchen ever and inside it cooking is an italian chef no actually it's a lebanese guy named tony shalhoub yeah and i had a thought i had a thought when i when when this occurred to me that like only one of these guys is vaguely italian and it's the tooch right right and so there's on the rare occasion that i am foolish enough to look at my my google alerts right for mentions of my name i have seen that there are sort of anti-semitic corners of the internet that have determined that i am secretly jewish wow no their their reasoning being uh all of this you know the nose and the the thing right yeah you have dark hair right i don't know why you're so interested in comments on your youtube channel on stormfront yeah again it was a very unwise evening right okay i just i made a number of poor choices that night one of them was opening my google alerts right right but what i wanted to say to these boys if i knew how to comment in this space which i don't what i wanted to say to them is like dude have you the everyone in the mediterranean looks like this the whole mediterranean basin everybody from along it we all look like this okay which is why a puerto rican guy and a lebanese guy can walk into a kitchen with the tooch and they they theoretically look like family right they all read as as uh as part of the same group yeah and um i think um yeah i wonder i wonder if they made this movie today if they would if they would have gotten a weird like blowback for that because there are like you know if it was some nationality other than italian yeah sure but italian is like i mean italians are famously cool about depictions of their culture like i'm sure they'd be fine yeah i'm just saying like there are so many like people in right-wing media now that are like just that like all they do all day is make extremely bad faith arguments about well if this is you know they would point out the hypocrisy hypocrisy of it you mean right right um and then we would need to dig into all of the numbers about how um italian-americans are really substantively uh disadvantaged in the united states they really terrible income nope nope they don't inhabit any positions of power right is this what your show is about goose like are we doing are we doing it right for the italians [Laughter] oh well let's let's let's use that as a transition so so the brothers the teach who is secundo and uh tony shalupu is primo because he's first in birth the firstborn yeah firstborn he stands to inherit the title and and all the land of of their family right exactly um but segundo seems to be the one in charge right like it's um primo is i think is it implied that primo is not uh i kind of got that sense yeah that he's he's um maybe on the spectrum or or in some way like i mean secundo says at one point in the movie that like primo basically can't take care of himself right and uh that's only hinted at in dialogue but um but yeah i kind of got that sense i didn't know if it was the idea that's that that primo is is has you know primo has problems or if it's part of the kind of broader um sort of uh infantilization of men that happens in in italian culture to some extent that is like that is expressed really i think very explicitly in the film by like these two grown ass men having the same bedroom and all that kind of stuff like that sort of men in in that kind of culture stay children until they are married right are you guys only children both of you do you have siblings i am an only i mean i know i know ben's answer to this question but goose do you have siblings yeah i have tony ragusia who has a youtube channel about tiny trees does tiny trees code for marijuana that would be much more profitable than his existing youtube channel about bonsai but uh yeah i mean just because you have specific interests that you are uh extremely excited about and focused on that doesn't make you uh non-euro normative in your brother's eyes right like i guess what i'm trying to say is like in a in a sibling relationship i think there's i think it's natural that one falls into the caretaker category for the other just because that's how families tend to operate so i never saw the brothers relationship as one of primo needing secondo's care i saw it as like one brother recognizing that the other brother uh isn't as good as some things as he is and when you're family you just kind of pick up that kind of slack i never read it the way you guys did i gotta get a brother it's never too late i think you'd hate that ben i think i think you're better off okay yes because as your business partner adam pranika knows you are or is implying you are apparently terrible in dealing with other people or collaborative yeah creative projects yeah um yeah their uh their food is too italian in this movie two italian not going over well with the american palette a couple of rubes stumble into this jersey shore ristorante and uh unassuming unassumingly uh no not unassumingly um when you don't know what you're in for what's the word for that um ignorant ignorant let's go with ignorantly ignorantly order the risotto yeah a seafood risotto and it comes out and here let's let's listen excuse me didn't you say that this was gonna be rice with seafood uh yes that is um it is the italian arboreal nice the best and then with shrimp and scallop and i don't i just don't see anything that looks like a shrimp or a scallop i just well i'm just i mean it's just it's not what i expected i like how she's about to say disappointed and then she stops yourself because even if she really i mean even though she's they're very much painted very broadly as this just absolutely no finer graces new jersey couple right like she knows to stop herself and not say disappointed she just says not what i expected there's something so familiar about the uh in the statement by secundo there because i know we've all worked in in retail or restaurant environments where a customer has outed themselves as a dome and and you need to give yourself that moment to react in in a in a kind way in a in a forgiving way and uh is the half a second he needs to find the words to not totally destroy this woman that at the dinner table right like i've i've heard myself say that uh so many times before like oh yeah yeah you need it as a crutch the crutch uh i was a busboy in a restaurant that had a michelin star and uh seriously took a complaint in the in the bay area right uh in new york oh new york oh okay and i took a complaint from a customer who had ordered the burger which was a like one of the burgers that got talked about as maybe the best in new york at the time and she was clearly a very rich woman who came in with like her little children and ordered the burger and it was very uh it was very medium rare it was on the rare side of medium rare and she had never encountered pink meat in the middle of a burger before and like was complaining that the kitchen had clearly made a mistake and i was like that's actually how the burger is no you said uh yeah that's actually how the burger is and uh yeah it didn't go over well she didn't she sent it back and didn't have to pay for it and you know so on the other hand should you not as her server have asked her how she wanted that burger or is that not what we do in in in in starred restaurants ristorante well yeah i mean i think that that's an interesting moment both in this movie and in like restaurants in general like this was a burger that was prepared in that way they didn't prepare it any other way at that restaurant and that's like a choice that was made by the chef and the ownership of the restaurant i was just i was i was the bearer of that news i didn't have any like any say one way or another no nobody could like you couldn't get a different type ma'am the the the juicy must be lucy yeah uh i'm making three dollars an hour plus tips so um but but yeah like there the the tension at the beginning of this movie is can primo change his food to appeal to the palettes of the potential customers he has or is he so particular about it that he refuses to and and i think there are good arguments in both directions you know well to dig into the technicalities of it i suppose the implication is that it's a it's a seafood risotto that's made with like i'm sure a freshly made beautiful seafood stock right and that is what's chiefly seafood-ish about it but it probably also has some little teeny bits of scallop and shrimp etc right we don't get an ecu on the plate we did not um we don't get those until later yeah but boy do we get them later yeah this is like jaws you know you see the shark but like toward the end so you see the teeny tip of the shark fin is in this risotto and like it is said in the movie that the reason that you don't put too much protein animal protein into the risotto is that like arborio rice is the best right like you it's all about the rice right yeah and what i wonder what i don't feel i know is like is that really how they would have felt about it like south southern intently they're from calabria right like so which is like the the tip of the boot right poor ass place that's right this is this is spicy the spicy part of italy right yes these people see the chiles and stuff so yes hot hot climate so all of the uh the post colombian exchange crops do very well there um and uh and this is why you know spices and tomatoes and all of that that's that's what then and wheat because they're broke so they don't have any actual meat they just eat starch right and this is why they eventually uh emigrated to the united states and why everyone in the united states thinks italian food is southern italian food right this is why right so what i wonder is like did they would they have thought would the guys back in calabria have thought that the reason you don't put in too much shellfish is because you need to keep the emphasis on the rice because the rice is sacred and blah blah blah i questioned that or did they just not put in enough manual protein because they didn't have that much right and to to bolster my my obvious favoring of the second theory there you're just reading the imdb pet ant comments right now goose like abhorreofan69 wrote wrote this comment exactly and i know you're reading it verbatim these people showed up in new york and new jersey and what did they do as soon as they got to this unbelievably this this land of plenty the sea of abundance that they found here they started putting freaking meatballs the size of their what they imagined the size of their balls to be like in their food right it's what they wanted they wanted more meat they just didn't have it and i wonder if like this whole it's a my broader kind of thought question about this film is that like is it actually like a 90s mentality that is being superimposed into when does this film take place in the 60s we think early 50s i think okay so basically in the 90s you've got like you know everybody fancy in new york everybody that you know ben harrison would have been hanging out with at the time um it was all just like oh actually see in italy they don't have meatballs with the spaghetti you know they actually they they either have the meatballs or they have the spaghetti and it was this realization that italian-american food was not italian food which is true and an important and valuable realization to have but that doesn't mean that italian food is bad italian american food is bad and indeed in the next scene when segundo goes over to uh bilbo baggins place um sorry what's legitimate what's that actor's name um ian hall ian yeah so um oh he what's his character's name it's uh pascal so he goes they go to pascal's right which is sort of painted to be a very successful italian shamelessly italian-american joint and we get a good fellas-esque like one shot of of uh the tooch walking through this restaurant and there's all kinds of wonderful things happening here and we see guys like you know shovel there's like like actual like shoveling of caprese salad like that we see and there's big giant meatballs and all this kind of stuff and i think we are given to understand in the audience that this place is trash but all i wanted to do was go there yeah the food looked great everybody's having a great time with that a ton of booths but there's something very uncomfortable seeming about the restaurant that primo and secondo operate it's so bright the chairs look uncomfortable it doesn't look like a place anyone would want to linger and have a fun evening out but tony shalhoub could come storming out of the kitchen and yell at you for yelling not liking your food no what you notice is the size of the tables right like instead of the big padded booth it's those teeny tables and i think it's where it's just it's a venue where people from the mediterranean basin as they are want to do can practice their long-honed art uh very large men sitting at teeny tiny tables sipping from little little cups right because that's just whatever like greeks do that the lebanese the italians they all do that they love playing with scale in the mediterranean you know that's right exactly it's all forced perspective that's what it's about i'm sorry pratika go ahead i mean it's weird like that other restaurant is made to look clownish for for all its excesses but but you're totally right like they don't take any responsibility for how uncomfortable their own restaurant might be seen by the neighborhood nothing is welcoming about it and i guess i just don't i don't know if if what the film thinks about that yeah i mean i think the film acknowledges that that primo and secundo kind of suck at their jobs right acknowledges that right but to what extent does it does it attribute their failure to their sucking at their jobs versus americans rubery you know i mean that's sort of something that they give ian holm to say though right he says a lot without saying it but like he kind of puts it on them as oh here we have a we have a clip yeah okay goes out to tweet in the evening after a long day in the office whatever right you don't want on his plate something that he has to look and think what the  is this yourself no right what do you want is hey a steak this is a steak i like steak you know i'm happy and god forbid we should think that the restaurant business is about making people happy right i mean i think that you can you can kind of make this movie what you want it to be like if you want it to be the searing indictment of ignorant american culture you can enjoy that as element of it and if you want it to be the indictment of fancy who won't bend even the slightest amount to make food that is pleasing to people in the market that they've chosen to operate a restaurant you can see it as that you know well it's the mark of a good film that kind of ambiguity is the mark of a good film would you wouldn't you say no i like to i like to know what the movie's about personally i really wanted to hit me over the head with it consider my head il timpano i want i want it to be beaten into me well so uh in this scene it is revealed that uh that things are not going well for the restaurant segundo needs a loan um and he's come to pascal for it and pascal says no he's trying to borrow from pascal to pay paul you just assuming that that very anglo-american banker is named paul what the man [Laughter] yeah that's a that's an awful assumption on my part i retract that that joke and uh and we we learned that really they're on the edge but at the same time in this scene it is revealed no it is implied that pascal has other reasons for wanting to see the brothers fail right um one being that he he wants primo especially to come and work for him at pascal's to to cook um but the other is that he seems to be aware that uh the tooch is is boning his beautiful wife uh isabella rossolini in addition to um well rather chastely not boning um minnie driver right and and maybe pascal's you know scuttling of the of the ristorante of their ristorante paradise i think it's called is to eliminate his romantic rival um and i think i think one of the things i really like about the film is that it is not explicit about pascal's motives and i think pascal is revealed over the course of the film to be a very complex person and who really actually has all three of those motives at all times right he's really the hero of the film you're right are you saying that as a joke because i kind of think he is i don't think you're wrong and that he's the most interesting character in the film i think everyone else has he's the most multi-dimensional everyone else has has single or double dimensions i'd say well what are the tooch's dimensions cause he we see him repeatedly being very cruel to many driver especially but also to his brother to really every he snaps at everyone and are we given to understand that that the tooch's character is a bad guy or that he's just a good guy under an enormous amount of pressure yeah he's under a huge amount of stress and he's he's experiencing the life of his business in a way that his brother isn't and it's i think it's natural when you're stressed out and frustrated to lash out at the people who are trying to love you i am someone who does it all the time just ask ben like sure let's ask ben he's carrying the stress and and keeping it all to himself too like he doesn't he he doesn't reveal what is bothering him to anyone uh is there a pride that motivates that he just doesn't want to doesn't want anybody know that he's not good at this yeah i mean that sort of because he walks around in a suit that says otherwise right right yeah i mean there's a martyrdom to that kind of pressure though too like i want to spare the people i care about the bad feelings that i'm experiencing at the moment you know right yeah and i like they don't need to they don't need to worry about this if i if i'm handling it um and the like the scene with ian holm is very interesting from that perspective because he's being vulnerable with like his greatest rival rather than all of the people that love him like well he sees he sees ian holmes like a father figure right doesn't he i guess so but it's like like i don't see anything about ian holm that would lead me to believe that that's like a good choice to see him as a father figure you know fathers provide ian home provides he bought a boat he had he had some good tips too like here are some like marketing ideas for your restaurant here's a way that i got some famous people in the front door at my place like like relying on ian holm to bring in the famous people is is the big mistake but he could have just listened to him and like thought about okay like who's who's here in town at a at a hotel i'll send i'll i'll do the bottle of champagne to the hotel room trick you know yeah or hell you've got like mark anthony working there that's right just have him sing for god's sake why do you need louis prima sorry so you thought about putting some mofongo on the menu and maybe trying to appeal to a slightly different crowd exactly people people in jersey shore love it these days um so uh so here we get to the sort of the animating thing of the whole of the whole film where where uh pascal promises to get his buddy louis prima the singer louis prima to come to ristorante paradise and experience the genius there and therefore spread the good word of the restaurant far and wide pretty annoying that there's gonna be a guy named prima in a movie that already has a character named primo i think yeah but of those two if you just go by their names you know who's gonna win yeah i guess so i mean especially in a like a machismo driven culture like the italians right like primos coming on top uh no comment i i can say it you can't say it i can say it i i can't say that that's right exactly um so the boys go about uh preparing a feast for mr louis prima and his and his entourage and one of my favorite parts of the film is when is when uh the tooch who has just come back by the way from having sex with isabella russolini it is implied again he not that he wanted to i mean god why would you want to but because he needed some business help right and so he he got he got the call of duty from from isabella rossolini when he went in and did his duty um and then he comes back and minnie driver is there helping uh tony shalhoub cook and being delightful and and beautiful and and uh so you know they're in the kitchen and they naturally get to smooch in and then bilbo baggins comes in and like sees them you know kind of catches them smooching in the in in the back and he does that you know that very italian thing where he just oh sorry and he gets out of there because you know you you know a man of a man does not block the right like that is what's what's said in that face right but then he does the second most italian thing which is that he immediately comes back in because he is so in love with love he's so enamored of what is happening in there that he just has to show appreciation and support for all of it right and it's just the best it's just the best i love it i love these people cute um the uh the crowd that winds up getting invited to the the meal is also really funny it's just kind of like everybody they happen to run into over the course of the day like oh yeah you should come to the big dinner yeah it's there's a kind of like magnificent seven vibe to it right like it's a posse film it's like it's rounding up the posse yeah yeah i wonder if there are cut scenes where because there's you know there's plenty of people in the at the feast that we didn't see their backstory of how they got there that's a good point yeah yeah we see the we see the cadillac salesman um we know that the we know why the newspaper reporter is there to report on louis prima's visit but yeah there's a bunch of people there we don't yeah big news is that that is back when newspapers had enough reporters ascend not even like an intern but a grown-ass man in a suit yeah to a reporter and a necktie to report on the possibility that louis prima ate there what was his deadline exactly if he was there until 3 a.m well that's back when they had the afternoon papers right so i guess so yeah stop the presses [Laughter] prima eats timpano also during this kind of magnificent seven rounding up the gang period of the film we see uh tony shalhoub um go over to the flower lady who was revealed to be cj craig from the west wing um and i actually really feel bad that i don't know her name because i think she's a marvelous actress alice and janie alex and janey that's all right yes and uh also looking lovely in this movie absolutely gosh all every every woman in this in this film is just a dream to look at um and liv schreiber also a dream to look at [Laughter] leave schreiber like kind of an extra in this movie like i don't even think he has an on-screen credit i feel like liv shriver has that effect in movies and many movies that he's not the star of you always get that is that liv schreiber kind of moment and then and then really like 90 of the time it is it is yeah exactly that's right yeah yeah so it is revealed that alice and janie and the shub are both hot for each other but the shub can't get himself together to say anything about it and this is the era when the dude has to be the one to say something about it um and so all of this sets up the big dinner scene which like it's so funny it's like there's this class i feel like there's a class of movies that are defined by one section right and it's almost as though like nobody really cares about the rest of it right there's like movies where it's like it's they'll call it the scene but it's not a scene right it's a it's a whole sort of act right um but and this is that act right it's the the dinner scene the dinner act very much though although i would say i would argue that the omelet in this movie is like a also also the scene level scene well that's the coda and we'll get there um yeah and yeah but in the in the dinner basically there's this tension happening throughout it and oh oh oh we should mention the the star dish of the evening is going to be this thing that the brothers say they they have brought from calabria and is called timpano let's listen oh my god it's a pasta no with a special crust no no and indeed this is a very impressive baked pasta dish when it comes out right it's like it's like wrapped in pasta sheets yeah but on the inside what's there it's like penne and tomato sauce and like some you know some like uh some ricotta boiled eggs hard-boiled eggs right which is like the most exotic thing in it if he combined risotto and meatballs and pasta and stuff like totally contradicting his feelings from the earlier scene this is the only way i like to combine these ingredients that's right exactly well if i can put this in the language of my audience who are who are younger than me it's uh um tony shalhoub colon never mixed pasta and other things also tony shalhoub colon mixed pasta and all the things right have you ever made this on your famous youtube channel um no and i kind of don't want to because it's it's to me it's such a disappointment like it like grow like for me you know growing up in the the um the like pluto orbit of new york um in in central pennsylvania like and like and and going to places that were that were where they were basically these guys or their descendants were cooking right and i grew up with the assumption that all italian food is just different spatial configurations of tomato sauce pasta ground beef and ricotta cheese right right it's just those things put on top of each other in different ways italian taco bell is what you thought of it as huh right oh absolutely absolutely fair comparison hey it's all the mediterranean basin uh-huh because everyone knows taco bell is just like iberian spanish cuisine i think if there's one takeaway anyone could could grasp from this show it's that it's that absolutely oh yeah yeah straight up um i i mean i had to say this looked really delicious to me i uh i've been making my own uh pasta lately and i know you make your own pasta a lot um the goose on your on your show um and the idea of like hand rolling the ziti that go in the timpano yeah it's like i bet this actually is really awesome it is and and it makes certainly it makes great film i mean just god the the the making of fresh pasta is one of the most beautiful things to behold and here it is in like grainy 1990s film stock it looks so beautiful and so much like i cannot shoot flower to save my life like it it's going to get blown out no matter what i do and um i don't i've often asked you guys for help with that and my advice was to toast it [Laughter] i uh i was full after the uh after the opening courses of this movie though like by the like the timpano comes out and i'm like how the are they gonna have courses after the courses we already had and then after this also like everybody's getting a wedding cake sized wedge of the timpano and then there's going to be chicken and fish how the do you serve that because it's like this tall like even if you did an incredibly thin slice it would still be like a complete dinner plate it's like sixteen hundred calories yeah in a quarter inch thick slice there's some honesty in this film about what an assault this meal is for everyone involved oh yeah yeah lots of those lots of those those shots of like everybody just being like that one lady like lying down on the table i do think that's that's very real i also you know i think we all three of us know that very real feeling that is captured very authentically where they're just like do we cut it no it's too hot like it's gonna it's gonna fall apart it needs to set right right and they're just agonizing over that moment and then they're about to cut it and they're like no you know cut it in front of everybody yeah if you're gonna blow it blow it big that yeah that is doing it on hard mode because if it hasn't set enough and they cut it then it just like no it gives it time to cool down because especially it's gonna be it's gonna it's going to be exposed to so much air as you carry it through oh yeah they go the 15 feet out into the dining room yeah that thing knows about thermodynamics okay like that thing is so big and so deep it's gotta take like two hours to to set right like like just to cool just to cool yes it's like you take a lasagna out of the oven you probably don't want to serve it for like 30 minutes but you take il timpano out of the oven like like take it out at noon and it's going to be ready by dinner time right yeah it's true but that very moment that like where they're about to cut in they stop like that spoke to me so hard because what i do all day is like fear making the irreparable action right when i'm like shooting food like i you know everything else that i can get multiple shots of whatever like but like you just described me and ben socially [Laughter] what's the last irreparable action that happened between the two of you and is there footage can i see it almost daily they happen um yeah the um i i like making pie and this is also a thing that you deal with with pie as like like you gotta you gotta you gotta let it sit on the windowsill and hope that a hobo doesn't steal it right and there my neighborhood is just lousy with bows so you know serves me right for buying a house right next to the rail yard you know yeah you gotta shovel off your your driveway ben there's like a thousand bindles out there and i'm like hey you want lunch and you're like i have had enough boiled boot for one lifetime [Laughter] well that's the thing i mean like it makes me that that raises the question it's like these kinds of like multi-course multi-multi-multi-course extravaganzas of dining we read about them in the historic record right like this is how like the romans theoretically ate or whatever or at least the the patrician among them right and when primo and secundo head back to italy to help their uncle it's how the romans will eat again my friend that's some good show don't tell cause i was gonna have to be like you know with some here's some exposition there's the stakes like they're thinking about going back to italy and that's like if they're gonna have to go back if this dinner doesn't go well but there you go you did the show don't tell there was also a stunning bit of show don't tell at the very beginning of this film where um tony shalhoub is like you know asks if something needs more salt but he asks in italian and or calabrian i should say um and uh and uh the toots says hmm and the way he says it is like he's he's saying like no no we're talking we're supposed to talk english here because i need to get you better at this okay remember that's what we're doing here ask me in english and not only does that tell us a whole bunch about like their relationship and their where they're at in life and all of that but it also establishes for the film why they're speaking english right right and we don't have we're not wondering that the whole time like we're wondering you know why is uh why is um um william wallace 40 years old in braveheart the whole time like one line of dialogue could have fixed that you know i've been fighting in france as a mercenary or something right like that's why i just came back now could have fixed it could have fixed it they chose not to also a film with an ending that really made me hungry [Laughter] well done so louis prima doesn't show oh go ahead yeah it's kind of a it's kind of a waiting for godot type of uh story arc here like the uh i mean like they don't even sit down to dinner until super late because because of the waiting for louis prima right issue i was i was waiting for him to come in like after everybody had finished with il timpano and been like hey we got a second timpano don't worry it's coming out right true because they did allow for that possibility yeah in the film like there's the moment where like where where the two says no don't don't don't turn out the second timpano because that one's for louis prima and it didn't occur to me until you said it ben but yeah that's the film actually trying to hold out suspense for us the audience that we might still believe that that that uh that louis prima could actually show up because we don't know at that point yet that pascal in fact never called louis prima because pascal wants the brothers to fail for at least three different very compelling reasons what happened to the second timpano did i miss the scene where they threw it in the trash or they had it for family meal the next day why didn't they just eat that in the morning instead of making eggs that's what i'm saying also maybe was this the moment that they left open for the sequel like big night two tempo two two tempano [Laughter] i'm not hungry anymore i think it was actually a deleted scene where uh when they were fighting on the beach tony shalhoub smashes it over segundo's head yeah oh my god that's a lost opportunity that would have been because you could totally do that you could totally smash that over someone's head yeah that would have been epic oh but instead uh the brothers just after their plan has failed and louis prima hasn't uh turned up they have a sort of an epic row on the beach outside the restaurant where they sort of tell to tell each other how they're how they actually feel about each other and i think the most like sci-fi element of this film is that neither of them has a dot of tomato sauce on there like like tony shalhoub is in a white chef's jacket the touch is in a white tuxedo jacket they've been cooking all night like both of them have been in the kitchen cooking neither of them has a spot on their clothes until they get in a fight on the beach see you're you're in the you're in the head space of like you know modern digital videography right where it's this isn't 4k this is like this is  film right grainy ass film too right it is what did you make of tony shalhoub's arms looking like two bearskin rugs when any professional chef would have had all that hair singed off the the first week in the kitchen [Laughter] let's see your arms to find out if you're a real man yeah have you guys seen that uh the state sketch where they're like it's like an italian family that owns a restaurant and the pope is coming to dinner and they're they're all wearing white because they're really excited that the pope is coming and then one of them comes out with a huge pot of tomato sauce and it just turns into a tomato sauce fight oh you got a sauce on my nice hawaiian jacket i wanted that scene in this movie yeah so that aspect beggar's belief but also this fight on the beach what is ostensibly the light source for that fight because it is the middle of the night and there's light coming from the ocean that's lighting them yeah what's there that's lighting them i like how mini driver is spot lit in the ocean too that's fun but with pesos too cause she's sad right and right that's the moment where she leaves segundo because she knows about isabella russolini and and then we get to the final scene another one shot right another long lingering one shot and apparently this is the scene like mgm was going to distribute this film and they didn't because they wanted the ending changed whoa they wanted them to eat the second timpano huh exactly that's totally what those executives would have said right like what we need that time that timpano it's like the it's it's the it's the cat you gotta save right it's the this is what i am on all our review shows all the shows i'm on with ben is like i represent the executive's point of view well sure if you don't who will yeah it's very brave spot for you to stake out adam um the there are many elements of this scene that are very difficult to pull off like the making making the omelette and we should say we should say for people who haven't seen it so yes uh um the touch after having been out all night following this row and this devastating you know failure comes back into the kitchen mark antony is asleep on the like a cat on the uh on the counter on the chef's table yeah yeah and uh and uh the and the touch proceeds to make an omelette to just to just feed feed his staff his staff of one his his his cat mark anthony is the food safety rating of this restaurant just a mr yuck face outside given given where given shaloob's hairy arms and where the the staff sleeps at night [Laughter] and that sync that doesn't work you can't open a restaurant without counting on the naturally anti-microbial properties of wooden cutting boards which my audience loves to remind me about yeah because hey is this seasoning the cutting board goose you just season it with an employee oh god you bring it here you bring it to my home my home in my bedroom where my wife sleeps yeah i didn't i didn't catch which of the two omelette plates he put the vinegar on though was it the one on the right or on the left you're implying that he he made like a chemical bomb for for uh shalub the really hard thing about this scene is that all three actors eat what amounts to an entire meal so if you need to reset they have to eat a meal again dude that's not i mean i'll grant you that but the much harder thing than eating a third of an omelette is for the touch to while he's like you know he's also ostensibly you know co-directing this film by the way so he's like not only starring in the scene he's directing it he's like making sure you know that he's hitting all his marks and his blocking and he's you know he's in the frame and all that kind of and then he cooks an omelette start to finish in the film in what in a stainless steel pan okay not even a cast iron a stainless pan he cooks not scrambled eggs but a omelet that flows out of the pan like water it slips right out it's beautiful i question whether or not those were real eggs or or movies stunt eggs movie eggs made out of like the corn flakes that they used to simulate snow or whatever yeah it's actually the one digital effect in the movie that's right because everyone knows it's not possible no no it's possible actually the movie proves how it's possible which is that you put half the bottle of olive oil into the pan before you put in the eggs and that's the secret i'm wondering if that pan was also pretty hot i'm like because cause i know i know that uh i in my experience i get less sticking to the pan when i let the the pan heat up for quite a while before i before i drop the eggs in so and there is enormous controversy about why that is oh really yes because like like people say that it's like oh well it's it's about like the micro pores and metal filling up due to thermal expansion of the metal and then people are just like wait a minute but when you take a piece of metal and get it hot it expands in all directions it doesn't just expand inward and then an like me comes in and says well actually the bottom is getting hotter than the rim so the rim is constricting the expansion so it's causing it to sort of force forget about the rim goose right that's right you're going to notice on the whole thing and then if you check your your google mentions you might find portions of the internet that are arguing that it's a secret conspiracy of the jews to make the pan indeed indeed but i'm not going to click on that one i'm going to click on the conversation at hotrims.net oh yeah that's that's where i uh that's where my email server is you know what you should you should do some research on the website for uh people who make just the outside of all pans rimjobs.com audience this is the kind of quality entertainment that you can get in your pod feed twice a week from the greatest trek family of podcasts do you know uh the trivia of how many times they shot this before they nailed it because to me the money shot the the craziest part is the pan away from the pan when uh when touch goes and gets another plate with the egg still on heat and like you've got to know you've got to know within fractions of an angle on the knob of the oven what you're working with there temperature wise otherwise when the pan comes back you're looking at a fire it's true because basically you know so so shalub comes in very late in this process and his reconciliation with his brother brother is wordlessly signified by shaloub sitting down and and uh and uh the tooch going and getting him that remaining third of omelet that's in the pan that for some reason is not burned secando's like what do you think about pivoting into a breakfast restaurant this is what he's not saying you will note like that i mean maybe it wasn't burned but that omelet was cooked the through because that's how the italians do it okay like they do not do they're not french it's this is not france okay i think custardy about yes they cooked all the way through and so i think that's why does that make it a frittata is that uh is that what that would be called i don't know if it would technically because it wasn't baked is is is not a frittata baked or is that merely my americanized sense of it the executives wanted this scene to end with shaloob going like i i thought there was going to be seafood in this omelette and i'm digging around in here and i'm just not finding my shrimps yeah if you if you know that this technically counts as a frittata just leave a comment on stormfront let us know [Laughter] i'm sure someone will let us know about that but to your point adam actually did you notice that like the eggs are blown out really blown out in the pan uh which is to me just to say for uh it's overexposed like they didn't quite plan for how bright this well i mean everything in this kitchen is blown out like i i mentioned earlier like the reservoir dogs type of lighting that they used is like so many movies in 1996 looked like this and it's why i i've saw this movie for the first time last night with you and it was so nostalgic to see it because it looked like a dozen other films it looks like the friends set that kitchen looks like the set of friends it does man why why were they lighting that way then i mean i mean it's an indie movie from the late 90s aesthetic yeah so why wouldn't it be dark and grainy it should look it should look like a movie from the 70s it should be like what the i can't even see what's happened i can't even it's an over correction goose that's what it is yeah i mean i think that this movie is kind of pitched as as as a comedy slash drama like it's it's not like a real it's it's not a knee slapper but uh but it does have kind of comedy lighting i would say it's not it's not super dramatically lit i think that's a really good point i think you're right it's sort of it's lit like a it's lit like a romantic comedy right um it's not lit like uh it's not lit like the godfather they didn't like many drivers vomit that was a choice they made like everything else everything else is lit super hot except for mini drivers vomit which by the way did she just get over served oh i thought it was implied that she is with child what oh no but no but they're chased they said they established at the beginning they're not boning yet i i asked my wife if that was if if the implication was that she was pregnant and she laughed at me so well i guess it's not the morning but the thing that my problem with that scene is that when you know no one sounds like they're coughing when they're vomiting that is not what vomiting sounds like i'm a famously loud vomiter like i really i would think yeah there's a lot of sound involved and that's for that reason i found that scene unbelievable well you're very tall so it's got there's a long big tree yeah a lot a lot of yards to be covered there's there's actually some stops involved it's not an express [Music] yeah there are there are locks in the river you got to wait until some more ships show up because they're not going to fill up the lock just for you right right yeah exactly come on man come back you're going to pack a lunch [Laughter] oh anywho so that's the film did you like it boys i love this film i love uh i love this pace of film this is uh not a piece of film that is uh really done anymore and i uh i really you know i think uh maybe that's that is a a pretty subjective matter of taste but um i like how it just tells its story in a very matter-of-fact way and doesn't try to unfold it at a clip to keep you interested and uh there's some self-confidence in that that i really like and i also like that the movie is not um it's not a happy movie it's not a movie about a a struggle to overcome something that yields super enviably successful results um and i think that uh like that's a real kind of story you know like the hey we like gave it our best shot and it didn't work out uh is uh it's it's tough but it's it's real but isn't that isn't that the happy ending of the film that in in failing to save their business they actually achieved what they were set out what they had set out to achieve which is to make exactly the kind of knight that they made for all of their lucky guests right yeah yeah i guess so i mean and that's what you should have told the bank loan guy like look i know you see what i'm doing here is a restaurant but we're just trying to make one great night yeah why didn't they involve why didn't they invite paul to the dinner yeah yeah then maybe he would have given them an extension on the loan that's the that's the happy ending that i think you expect from a film with a title big night you know like they finally impress the guy they get the big win in the end ben when you saw this film for the very first time how long did you hang on to the hope because seeing it last night i hung onto the hope way into the movie like all the way to the end maybe into the next morning like thinking eventually like by virtue of when this film was made we were going to get what a sweet man you are adam frannika what a sweetie they're happy everybody went home and told their friends about how great the food was and that like people would start streaming in for lunch it's a wonderful life ending of like they they open up the door after eating the omelet to open the next day and there's like a lineup and the newspaper articles out there and like it's changed everything i was 13 when this movie came out and i saw it in the theater and um so i imagine that i have to sneak into it it is weird i don't know why the choice to make it an r-rated film was a little bit interesting because it's really just only a little bit of language and they could have just had them curse in italian and they could have this could have been a pg yeah there wasn't even a booby in there no you sell more tickets when it's r right especially if you're an indie movie that's what they say right i guess so yeah but but yeah i mean i i so i don't remember exactly what my mindset was at the time but i imagine that that uh that that the happy ending the bow tying up the film would have been what i expected given my age and uh incredible incredible amount of naivete at the time well it could have been i feel like if the film were made today as like a gritty you to the audience in indie film right it would it could have ended a lot darker i mean especially because ian holm is the heavy in this movie and you know ian holm has that gear in him to not just be moody at a piano to be but to be threatening and dark but he doesn't go all the way into that gear he could have destroyed them just emotionally it would have been you know but it's the tiniest little bit of where he says like i know your brother is a genius what kind of man are you right that's the only that's the oh that's he just digs the it's just the tip of the knife you know yeah and and at the at the end at the end the the brothers reconcile did they set their own chef on fire and kick him out is that what happened to that guy yeah so they tried to they tried to emulate a man yeah instead of fire him that's why you know ian holm is capable of that kind of threat because of what they did to that one chef [Music] he woke up that morning and chose violence yeah yeah um yeah i mean kind of a weird accent from me at home in this movie oh yeah he's not even from the mediterranean basin that guy he's just i know we're he's just from you know belgravia or something like he's from london very weird cultural appropriation did not like did not like so objectionable i ian holman olive face [Laughter] oh no oh no olive face is now gonna be a thing [Laughter] all the face could be like the name of this podcast oh man uh untitled as of this recording oh my god i mean it's a bit of a trend among food podcasts there's carb face you could be olive face because those things are very comparable um i i upon re-watching the film i i was amazed by a lot of its technical achievements those you know those one shots are unbelievable um the whole dinner thing is so it's just everything is so beautifully shot the the scene where ian holm um lights a few pieces of paper on fire and they kind of alight like birds you know and is that how he set his chef on fire in his restaurant like an accident doing that trick the chef float up into the air and you catch him in your hand that's beautiful that's beautiful but like there's there's like there there are emits from the sort of people watching this like a really sincere like oh sound that is it's got to be like real it's like that's not acting that's like a real human reaction and for it all to be on film the way it is and and and you know except for the eggs at the end perfectly exposed it's like i i don't know it's just it's incredible but at the same time there it's it's it's an opera and is very arch and broad in ways that bothered me this time around like certain i mean especially like the way those those those idiot americans are painted in the restaurant in the beginning yeah who's who's gonna have the bravery to paint the americans in a good light please that's what i'm here for you're right goose yeah i'm a man of the people god damn it i'm a man of the people yeah yeah in the uh in the greatest trek family of uh trek recap podcasts you you boys uh bestow and honor or call the drunk shimoda um we do which is sort of the we won't explain the back story there's a whole wikia where you can read about uh all of the in-jokes or memes as the k when did when did in jokes get rebranded as memes they're just in jokes um all of the memes that are in uh uh greatest track family of podcasts you can read about those on the internet but drunk shimoda is uh the person who's just kind of having the most fun in in in a show or a film at any given time or being wacky or something i wonder if we couldn't is is it uh the olive face shimoda wow yeah let's definitely call it that who's who's your olive face oh my olive face is mark anthony yeah no doubt like dude is just hanging out with his unbelievably glorious cheekbones you know the kind of cheekbones that like i wonder sometimes like i could have cheekbones that good i've never been as lean as marc anthony so who knows they could be he is a great singer but olive face [Laughter] he's legit olive facing it in this film and he is having a blast just hanging out watching all of the madness go by and he's like i think he's like legit he's like a shop cat like they portray him as like there really is yeah never even talks to him like nobody tells him to do anything it's never like hey go sweep up or or hey here's the question is he a slave oh jesus like did they did they bring him over from the old country and then take his passport away yeah jesus pretty dark huh yeah the stakes are the highest for him in this whole whole night what the  a condo maybe it's good that he and home ruined you yeah wither wither cristiano at the end of this film yeah yeah what does he where does he go and do this yeah well this is the this is the marxist reading of this film that i was hoping for is like let's talk about what happens to the working people do you have an olive shimoda ben olive face shimoda i suppose i'll give it to secondo for just the like like the the thing that uh was so remarkable to me about this man who carries all of this pressure on his shoulders keeps it from all the people that he loves is that he is also like chilling the most in this movie like primos is in the kitchen all day and secundo is like i'm gonna go test drive a cadillac i'm gonna go right after having sex with isabel isabella rossolini which happened like you know like 10 hours after he was making out in the car with um minnie driver he gets to do so many fun things despite all of the all of the gloom and doom that he's uh he's carrying around with him so um in some ways that's kind of aspirational to me like if if i'm stressed out i need to remind myself hey go test drive a cadillac dude yeah that's all i need to do the work is going to get done by primo and cristiano who will you clean up after it right and get no credit unlike primo who will get all the credit genius it's genius good good system adam pranika do you have an olive face shimoda yeah i mean you kind of brought it up tangentially it's uh campbell scott's bob character the the car dealership guy oh yeah who kind of parachutes into this film from a totally different movie i feel like and is a character from somewhere else some other movie even he looks like he's coming in from that thing you do yeah and i don't know there was like that quality about him of of just being kind of a witness to things yet still going to the party and enjoying it as much as anyone else the he drives away in a cadillac with like with one conscious woman and one unconscious woman which is pretty  sinister totally like his end of the night is wild his beginning of the day is wild he does not seem to be a like a very good car salesman which i like because especially after after his character is introduced you're like all right here comes the hard sell like touch cannot afford this car and here comes this who's gonna like break his heart by by sitting him in the driver's seat but no that wasn't it at all they just like go for a drive and bond as two people in crazy job situations and i mean you get a lot of him in the beginning and almost none of him in the end but like my i always found campbell scott in the in the frame because i was always interested in what he was doing he was such an outsider to this whole thing so uh i dug his participation in the story quite a bit i'll take it he also had a very beautiful flowing hair and a big forehead much like yourself yeah oh i definitely saw myself in campbell scott for sure also the uh the broken hands that he doesn't want to talk about yeah he has no memory of how he got that yeah well listeners um if you like uh star trek or if you don't if you just like listening to two idiots have fun hangs uh check out my friends my dear friends adam pranica benjamin r harrison over on the greatest generation where they are presently recapping uh star trek voyager and uh overall or you could go to their other uh podcast which is

Cinnamon rolls with marshmallow glaze,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m4YbL7dAfw8/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLAilNpmDnpgMt2qOuiW4h9trbnlFA,m4YbL7dAfw8,"10 minutes, 17 seconds",Thanks to Kove Audio for sponsoring this video!

some uncommonly delicious cinnamon rolls really buttery and tender but also fluffy and they hold a real tidy shape in the oven i'll show you the standard sugar glaze but i'm also going to show you an unconventional frosting inspired by marshmallow fluff i love this frosting my wife hates it we report you decide to make a yeast dough that is extremely buttery but also has a strong enough gluten network to rise we need to follow a kind of weird procedure i've got a mixing bowl and that's a third of a cup of milk 80 mils and i'll throw a little pinch of sugar in there for the yeast even though they probably don't need it they do need me to heat this up a little bit which you could do in the microwave but my stove has the advantage of being right here i'm just looking for body temperature or something a little north of that i'm only making half a dozen rolls today and yet i'm putting in a whole packet of dry yeast which is a lot seven grams more than two teaspoons you could use half that but i like the flavor i get from extra yeast and i will let them rehydrate and wake up while i grab butter 2 tablespoons of butter 30 grams i'll melt that in the microwave real quick and then in goes a quarter cup of granulated sugar 50 grams that sugar will lower the temperature of the butter thus making it safe for my egg if you were gonna bake a full dozen you could just use the whole egg but i'm making half that so i'm just gonna use the yolk in my dough pure yolk makes the rolls taste a little better anyway and i have plans for that white in goes three or four grams of salt which is like half a teaspoon of this morton kosher i think cinnamon rolls are far better with a noticeable amount of salt in them and lastly a little glug of vanilla which you can skip the frosting will have vanilla in it too get all that stirred up and smooth my yeast is all frothy so it's time for flour you could use all-purpose flour but i think bread flour is better and lately i'm loving this double zero pizza flour that recently arrived at my grocery store hashtag not an ad just a fan double zero is a super fine grind of flour and it makes these rolls noticeably smoother but any flour is fine the extra protein of the bread flour will help these rise in spite of all that butter and also give them a heavier and silkier mouth feel literally just as much flour as i can stir in there if you want precise measurements watch somebody else i think it depends on what kind of flour you're using anyway so i say just go by feel as much flour as you can easily stir in to this much liquid which for me ended up being just under a cup that i will simply leave to autolyze and pre-ferment for about a half hour over here with my fatty liquids i might as well stir in some flour too again just as much as i can stir in which ended up being maybe two-thirds of a cup there's so much fat in here that the gluten in this flour basically won't be able to develop at all but at least i can get the particles hydrating a bit which will cut down on kneading time plus all the greasy liquid here will be much easier to integrate with the other dough when it's in paste form like this okay i'll just cover everything in a damp towel and come back half an hour later clearly a lot of fermentation and gluten development has happened if we'd mixed everything together at once the huge amount of butter and sugar in this recipe would not have allowed that kind of rise i'll dust more flour on there and dump in my greasy paste use my flowery hand to scrape off the spoon and get to kneading need until this is homogenous dusting flour as necessary to keep it workable kind of groovy at this stage yes lots of popular cinnamon roll recipes have you mix everything together at once but you will note they probably have proportionately less butter than mine here i've tried doing the direct mix on a dough this rich and it just doesn't rise you do it this way you get the best of all worlds i want enough flour in here so that the dough is still a little sticky but i can form it into a reasonably smooth ball perfect maybe two cups total of this double zero bread flour in here maybe 250 grams cover and let it rise again until doubled an hour or two during which time we can clean up and maybe listen to a podcast hey this guy has a new podcast available everywhere and we can crank it on the new mini speaker from cove the sponsor of this video i was filming a recipe where i cooked a steak and a pan big sound from an adorable little package this connects to your phone or whatever via bluetooth 5.0 or a simple cable if you want great battery life great big sound and get this you can buy another one and chain them together with the push of a button now you've got true stereo sound that you can use to fill the whole room the speakers are water resistant and they have a built-in microphone with a 30 foot range so you can talk to your phone pretty sweet buy one or two cove mini commuter speakers with my link and code in the description and you will save 67 or more link in the description use code a mini 67 for 67 off the cove mini commuter thank you cove so after two hours this has about doubled don't be concerned if you don't get a huge rise at this stage again there's a lot of fat and sugar in there pull her out to a board and a little dusting of flour so nothing sticks and then roll this out to a rectangle that's about a foot wide 30 centimeters the closer you can get it to a perfect rectangle the less waste you're gonna have at the ends the bottom long edge i want to roll way thinner than the rest this will be the flap that i used to seal the roll let me get some more melted butter ready another couple tablespoons we'll use this for a couple of things now and this bowl is already dirty so filling a third of a cup of brown sugar 65 grams or white sugar with a little glug of molasses because that's all brown sugar is and i actually want more molasses than brown sugar normally has so heavy hand with the molasses the eponymous cinnamon i like a whole tablespoon for six rolls which is a lot but i like it spicy this is pre-ground and pre-ground is generally less powerful so you need more with it a teeny little pinch of salt is good and then this is important just enough melted butter to make this the consistency of like damp sand i'll stir this up real good and then see if i need more if you put too much butter in the filling it'll all melt out during the baking and just run all over the pan but i need a little more in there just to make the filling hold together if there's no butter at all the filling is powdery and it just falls out of the roll before you can even bake the thing there that consistency is a good compromise take some melted butter and grease up the inside of the dough sheet avoiding that thin flap at the bottom we want that to be the opposite of slippery dump on the filling and pat it as evenly as possible don't bother getting it all the way to the edges on the sides because we're just going to trim off that excess anyway and keep it off that flap at the bottom that's our seal and accordingly i'm going to get it wet plain water this will glue the whole roll together and keep it from bursting open in the oven time to roll starting with the long thick end don't stress about rolling this super tight it's even better if you don't give the layers some room to puff up in the oven get the seal on the bottom so gravity presses it down a little bit and at this stage you could just put the whole roll in the fridge slice it and bake it for breakfast in the morning i've got some leftover melted butter so i might as well rub it suggestively around the whole cylinder this will make the edges bake up even tastier and there we go time to slice trim off that end first and then you can get really clean even slices i'm going maybe an inch and a half thick four centimeters aiming for six rolls and there we go grab a baking sheet lined with parchment if you've got it and then very gently lay on the slices cut side up this would actually be a lot easier if i had chilled the roll overnight so if you do that you definitely want to cover these and let them warm up and proof at least a half hour before baking which i'm going to do anyway they're a little puffier after a half hour proof which is good and then they go at 400 degrees fahrenheit 200c convection if you've got it while we wait here's that weird frosting i was telling you about my reserved egg white goes into a saucepan along with another third of a cup of sugar 65 grams heat on medium and then whisk continuously if you aren't whisking when this reaches the critical temperature you're going to suddenly have scrambled eggs oh i forgot we need a glug of corn syrup or honey or some syrup that is not all sucrose like the table sugar is if you don't use the syrup the sugar recrystallizes and gets super grainy just keep whisking and you'll see the egg protein start to coagulate and thicken and two minutes later i've got a mayonnaise-like consistency so i'm done i'll turn off the burner and in the residual heat i'll melt about a tablespoon of butter just melt it in real gently so it doesn't break time for a splash of vanilla whisk that in and there you go marshmallow glaze it's italian meringue but a little thinner and richer which makes it better for a thin coating it has a strong marshmallowy flavor which i believe is basically the taste of sugar plus protein the rolls have been baking for just about 10 minutes and they're almost done even though they look kind of pale if you over bake these the filling just melts and leaks out and you can see that's starting to happen over there also if you over bake them the centers start to push up like little spires and eventually that causes the whole roll to fall apart plus i think you want the texture to be soft and a little doughy so when the edges are just a little golden that's it out they come and let them cool until they're firm enough to pick up maybe 10 minutes meanwhile i'll mix up the more conventional glaze if you want to see that which is just a pile of powdered sugar a little glug of milk and an even smaller glug of vanilla stir stir stir and really it takes a tiny amount of milk to get this all dissolved into a smooth thick glaze and you could glaze the rolls on their parchment paper but hey this is already dirty so let's do this professional like on a rack this is my marshmallow glaze over here and my preferred way of doing this is to just dunk in the top get it completely coated in glaze and as it drizzles down the sides on the rack it'll spread in attractive ways alternatively you could just put one on the rack and drizzle with a spoon side to side or you could do the little spiral pattern or if you're four and a half years old you could just try total chaos i can just mustard it mustard it sure that's the conventional glaze by the way made with the powdered sugar and milk which looks about the same as the marshmallow on at this stage but it tastes pretty different and it dries to a more crispy texture with a matte finish i like the marshmallow one better myself now honestly i know these don't look particularly remarkable but the texture and flavor of these is way better than any homemade cinnamon roll i've ever had before including all the ones i've made before that pre-ferment step just makes all the difference in the world try it if you don't believe me,3

""The Invention of the Restaurant: Paris and Modern Gastronomic...",2022-11-24 14:47:05.183328, welcome to bloomington indiana like many large college towns this town has a fantastic restaurant scene here's a story about restaurants that you might have heard before the modern concept of the restaurant was born in paris around the turn of the 19th century the revolution cooks who had previously been employed in the kitchens of great aristocratic households well they suddenly found themselves out of work when said great houses lost their heads insert guillotine sound effect in the sudden absence of any more princes to serve these incredibly skilled cooks created a whole new industry serving instead the general public out of a storefront instead of a private kitchen in the western world at least that is the origin story of the restaurant and serious works of scholarship repeat that story all the time is it true kinda not really says dr rebecca spang professor of history here at indiana university specializing in the history of 18th and 19th century france and i wrote a book called the invention of the restaurant in a new and updated edition in bookstores now and linked in the description so there are a number of problems with that old story about the birth of restaurants the first being that the first recorded restaurants were not in france the first known restaurants weren't even in europe they were in asia specifically present-day china song dynasty like half a millennium before restaurants showed up in paris they had them in china i mean they didn't call them restaurants because restaurant is a french word but they were restaurants in what we would call the 12th and 13th century a very vibrant urban culture with hundreds of thousands i mean the biggest cities in the world at that point were in that part of the world and writers from that culture describe menus of endless length um and great sophistication and menus are one defining feature of true restaurants neither the chinese nor the french invented selling prepared foods to other people despite the fact that both the chinese and the french have a tendency to claim they invented just about everything no civilizations all over the world have ancient traditions of cooking food and then selling it or otherwise distributing it outside the home i mean the great majority of people in the course of human history didn't have their own kitchens didn't have dining rooms uh so either people were you know peasants eating what they had perhaps cooked in the single room they had or more likely if you're thinking about an urban setting people did have to eat from street vendors from taverns indeed the modern food truck is simply the latest incarnation of a truly ancient business concept street hawking and yeah modern food trucks have menus because they've been heavily influenced by the restaurant industry but historically speaking that probably wasn't the norm it was more like here's some food i cooked do you want to buy some yes or no those were the two choices on the menu yes food no food dr spang says it's a similar story if you look at the history of other pre-restaurant eating establishments imagine you're a traveler i'm traveling right now i'm visiting bloomington indiana because i used to live here a long time ago and i get back to visit every now and then really like it here anyway imagine you're a traveler in a historical context there's no hotels for you to stop at when it gets dark at night so what do you do instead well you try to keep to heavily trafficked paths and you might come across a house that has some extra rooms in it and if you've got a little bit of coin in your pocket you could rent one of those rooms for the night and get yourself a meal you would have sat down at an inn with everybody else who was staying in the inn and all the food would have been put on the table at once and it would have been what we today would call family style there's no menu it's whatever the innkeeper cooked that night you can either eat it or not same deal with drinking establishments which urban areas all over the world have had since forever taverns pubs historically such places might have also offered some food but not a menu there's one joint of mutton in the corner you can either have some with your ale or not that isn't a restaurant even though modern pubs like the irish lion here in bloomington have basically evolved into sit-down restaurants with vestigial bars attached to them same deal with tea houses coffee houses very old institutions but not restaurants at least not originally le petit cafe in bloomington is run by this adorable old french couple who settled here decades ago and despite the name it's a restaurant not a cafe historically in france a cafe is a coffee house a restaurant is a place where you sit down and order a meal you get a choice and then you get up and you leave all right where a cafe you can hang around you drink your coffee maybe you drink something else but the emphasis is not on the food um right they might serve food but the point of going there isn't for the food even though lots of cafes today have restaurantified and become all about the food we'll talk about the origins of true restaurants in a moment but if you're all about the coffee consider patronizing the sponsor of this video trade coffee i think one reason i hated coffee as a much younger man is that most of the ostensible coffee houses in my world were just sandwich shops that also made bad coffee and most coffee i got at home was bad because most coffee at the grocery store was stale not so now when i buy from trade coffee i take their quiz online i tell them what i like and they connect me with a roaster who sends me something super fresh straight to my door not some global commodity blend but in this case beans from a place in guatemala where they do the so-called natural process of drying the beans when they're still inside their fruits which gives them this crazy complex fruity flavor i just love totally different from conventional wet processed coffee but whatever you like trade can connect you with a roaster today who will send you something uncommonly fresh and great and then trade will send you more so you get a variety and you never run out cancel shipments or change the frequency anytime right now trade is offering a total of twenty dollars off your first three bags when you go to drinktrade.com slash regucia that's more than 16 cups of coffee for free with my link in the description twenty dollars off thank you trade anyway historically speaking inns are not restaurants cafes are not restaurants pubs are not restaurants bistros are not restaurants bistros were boarding houses in paris where you could rent a room and also get your meals for your rent so what exactly are restaurants according to dr spang the great innovation of the first restaurateurs is both in their menu but in how they serve it so there are separate tables for different parties right on the model really of a cafe which is an institution for the earlier part of the 18th century separate tables printed menus so you can pick what you want and they serve pretty much at any hour right meaning it's not a situation like at the inn where dinner is whenever the innkeeper gets dinner ready if you miss it you miss it at a restaurant like the excellent farm here in bloomington you show up within a reasonable window of time they sit you and your party at your own little table away from everybody else they give you a menu with tons of options on it you pick a few and then they cook or at least finish those dishes to order just for you and they deliver them to your table like your king for a day that is a restaurant and they had establishments meeting this basic definition like 800 years ago in song dynasty china but then there's this whole thing where song dynasty fell and china kind of de-urbanized arguably de-modernized for a while between that and the eventual european colonialism a lot of modern restaurant culture in east asia is a hybrid of eastern and western tradition and the western tradition developed independently in france in paris in its own surprisingly weird way dr spang says it started before the revolution in france think about the word restaurant where does that word come from in french it comes from the verb which means to restore to refresh so the first restaurants or really they were called the first restorers rooms are opened in the 1760s and then in the 1770s in paris to serve restorative dishes specifically restorative bullion bone broth just as bone broth has been a health craze in recent years so it was in pre-revolutionary france along with some other trendy health foods the first restaurants also served rice puddings water from the king's well uh wine with special designations all of those things in the 1760s 70s would have been very very special indeed and the establishments that served these trendy expensive therapeutic edibles operated a little bit more like health spas health spas have an ancient tradition of highly personalized individualized service oh come this way monsieur i can see you're so tired and weary come over to this quiet table where you can be by yourself and rest here is a list of all of the therapies we offer a person of your refined taste would certainly want to pick something specific right they're selling restorative bullion specifically to those delicate urban individuals who didn't feel inclined to eat a big heavy meal the first restaurateurs advertise specifically that they cater to those who are not in the habit of eating an evening meal so any but right see the first restaurants are places where you go out not to eat but to delicately sip your bouillon now why would you do that like if you don't feel like eating why do you go to a restaurant you go to show to your friends to the people at the other tables that you are so sophisticated so um sensitive would have been the 18th century word that you can't really tolerate the sort of heavy meals that other people are eating all right so it's a sign of social distinction social sophistication what happens in the course of the french revolution is that that kind of marking of social distinction is no longer what we in the 20th 21st century we call politically correct so the restaurateurs have to change things up and instead of saying that they cater only to the finest people to those with delicate appetites instead they say ah we make all dishes available to all honest frenchmen um so it's a complete inversion of the kind of audience to which they were trying to appeal so yeah that's the true and much weirder origin story of the western restaurant industry according to dr spang's research the innovation that really stuck wasn't what they served at the first restaurants but rather how they served it individual tables show up when you want get a menu choose from many options have it prepared to order pay your bill and get out is there any truth at all to the old story about private cooks losing their jobs when their masters got the chop and then all they could do was turn around and sell chops to the mob who'd done the chopping there were a few very famous individuals who had been um chefs not in manners but again in [Music] princely households in paris who left those households um went into the public food trades and wrote cookbooks so the famous one is somebody called beauvier but he actually had left the royal household already in the 1780s so he's not pushed out of his work because of the french revolution you could say that he's just part of this commercialization of food culture that happens in the course of the 18th century and that commercialization happens in part due to the revolution also in part due to some of the factors that led to the revolution one of those being the rise of the urban middle class the bourgeoisie who didn't understand why the hereditary nobility and royalty should have all the fun there's a reason we still refer to people who like the finer things and who are capable of paying for them as being bougie i suppose i'm pretty bougie at this point i should acknowledge booziness went on the decline in france immediately after the revolution it became quite unfashionable and indeed dangerous to flaunt one's wealth and then this short guy named bony came to power and got into a war against basically all of europe and if you had money or food you wanted to be seen shoveling it to the army not in your own face there's a period of about a year in 1803 when the treaty of omeon creates a short-lived peace across europe this is the time when british travelers flock to france to see what the revolution has changed and this is when they start writing and say oh my gosh you'll never believe it they have these establishments called restaurants i guess they must have been created by the revolution not having paid attention to the servers of restorative bullions who'd been there since the 1760s and 1770s but the brits loved the restaurant concept and they absorbed it and then the brits and the french exported that concept all over the world via their respective massive empires and back home within france all kinds of other older eating establishments kind of morphed into restaurants establishments that in an earlier vocabulary would have been called estamine or all start adding the word restaurant because that becomes the familiar word and that of course is the word that foreigners know um so they take the word and then sometimes they take the the style of service as well and all of that explains why basically every place in the world now has restaurants and people in those places have turned around and exported their versions of the restaurant concept as far away as bloomington indiana your table is ready right this way monsieur,3

Thanks to Immi for sponsoring this episode! Go to https://thld.c...",2022-11-24 14:47:05.183328, hello it's adam ragusia and here's how i've failed recently i was filming a recipe where i cooked a steak and a pan and then i took the steak out to let it rest and while it rested i cooked some dark leafy greens in the residual heat and the residual meatiness of said pan that's one of my favorite techniques because big pieces of meat need to rest before you eat them but vegetables do not so you cook your vegetables while the meat is resting ideally in the same pan so there's only one dirty dish and your meat and vegetables will both be perfect at the exact same moment plus your vegetables will taste like meat which is all i've really ever wanted in life anyway that's what i was doing i was frying the curly purple kale in the meaty pan and i didn't have quite enough liquid in the pan so the garlic and the ginger that i also had in there was starting to burn on the bottom so i had to act real fast which normally wouldn't be a problem except i was also trying to film all of this with my camera and my lights and all of that business and anyway i did not have enough time to reposition my camera for a certain shot and the resulting footage is at this really extreme angle like i believe in film school they would call it a dutch angle the horizon is it like a 40 degree incline in this shot and i normally fix slight leveling problems in post production i shoot in a higher resolution than my publishing resolution and that allows me to zoom in in on footage in post-production and when you zoom in you can rotate the footage to make it level but here the incline was just too extreme i would have had to zoom in way too much in order to get it level and my shots are generally too tight as it is so i just had to leave this crazy hugely inclined shot in the finished video i'm hoping that viewers think that this is intentional an intentional artistic choice on my part it's what i would call in my own head an mtv angle because back when i was an impressionable youth watching mtv back when it was still a music channel all of the vj interstitials between the music videos were shot at these really extreme wonky angles because this isn't your parents basic cable channel man where everything is straight and level man this is mtv and our camera operators lean to the side because that's what the kids today want to see yeah i'm hoping that you will think that the kl shot was an mtv angle but it wasn't it was just a mistake and i think that we should all be in the habit of confessing more of our mistakes to each other so that we can see that we are not the only miserable failure in town everybody else is dying inside all the time too it's not just you so i'll be talking about my failures at the beginning of this the new adam regucia podcast which is sponsored today by amy the delicious instant ramen that is not terrible for me i love this stuff the noodles are made chiefly of pumpkin seed protein rather than wheat they do use wheat gluten so the noodles still chew like real noodles but there's a whopping 21 grams of protein lots of fiber and only six net carbs and surprisingly low sodium the flavors of eemi are incredibly tasty and very meaty despite not having any animal products at all in them there's no shrimp in the tom yum shrimp there's no chicken in this one the meaty flavor comes from yeast extract which is an amazing underrated vegan ingredient that i love and i'm not even vegan you cook it just like any instant ramen and it's ready to slurp in seven minutes you

the ingredients of a hit show podcast youtube series tv show whatever personality subject and moment a personality whom people like and want to spend time with subject matter that they're really interested in and that personality bringing you that subject at exactly the right moment when you want it the right moment in your life in your day in history whatever personality subject and moment these are the ingredients of a hit and that is not my observation is the observation of a fellow named eric newsom who was a programming executive at npr for a while national public radio here in the states he was involved in the creation of hit podcasts like ted radio hour and invisibilia eric left that job to go work at audible for a while and now i believe he's consulting and he has a book that i recommend it's called make noise a creator's guide to podcasting and great audio storytelling by eric newsom eric newsom was still a vice president at npr back when i hosted and produced a podcast called the pub the pub is still on all the podcasting apps if you want to go listen to it but you probably don't it was a show that i made for a non-profit newspaper called current which itself is a trade paper for people who work in the american public broadcasting industry so people who work in viewer and listener supported tv and radio here in the states the american equivalent of the bbc people who work there this paper is the niche trade publication for them and i made a podcast for that paper so i made a podcast that was four people working in public broadcasting and it was called the pub sounds thrilling i know anyway the weird thing was the pub got kinda popular for a while not by the standards of success by which anything in the real world would be judged but for something in a highly niche market it did surprisingly well i did the pub for a few years and eric newsom when he was at npr was one of the figures whom i covered as a journalist i reported on him and what he was doing at npr on my show the pub so that is how he and i came to know each other a little i got kind of tired of doing the pub after a few years my interest simply shifted away from public radio and tv and i felt that i'd said everything of value that i had to say in that world i was eager to pass the mic to somebody else and so as i was thinking about quitting the show i called up eric newsom for career advice which i probably shouldn't have done because it was a bit of a conflict of interest given that i was supposed to be covering him but i think that he had actually left npr by then and and i knew that i was leaving the pub so i figured hey what the hell anyway i called eric newsom for career advice i told him that i was thinking about leaving the pub and i asked him what he thought my next career move should be and that's when he dropped that whole personality subject and moment thing on me i'm not sure if those were the particular words that he used but that was the essence of it a hit show results from the confluence of those three things and i realized immediately the subtext of what he was telling me eric was saying implicitly adam if you leave your modest hit of a podcast the pub don't be sure that your audience will follow you sure they like you if they didn't like you they wouldn't be listening but you are only one leg of the stool they like you talking about the thing they care about at this particular moment when they want to hear you talking about that thing they care about they don't like you they like the show which is at most only one third you all of that eric nuzum said to me without actually saying it so eric if you're listening please forgive me for misquoting your non-quotation if i did misquote it but i don't think i did i think that's what you were telling me and it scared me it made me less confident leaping into the next phase of my career which eventually led to where i'm at now which is nearly 2 million subscribers on youtube nearly 400 million total views of my videos videos where i'm talking about food not radio or journalism and it's far more successful than any possibility i had ever seriously hoped for and why is it successful why do people like the videos i post i can only assume it's a combination of personality subject and moment change one of those three variables and maybe that wheel would not have dug in and found its traction i think there's probably a lot of wisdom there for people who have been somewhat successful at anything not just making shows i certainly knew guys in high school who were super popular and successful at being a dude in high school and they probably assumed that they would go on being popular and successful after high school and they definitely did not because their success was a combination of who they were what they were doing and when they were doing it their personality stayed the same the who remained after high school but the what and the when changed and the winning formula was broken it's very natural to think that when you succeed at something you are the reason for that success and surely you were part of the recipe but there were many many other ingredients if i examined my own success on youtube i could list a lot of ingredients that have nothing to do with me sir maybe some people like me but what they like even more is pizza and in fact they knew and liked pizza long before they'd ever seen my name and even longer before they'd learned how to pronounce it it's ragusa by the way my first big hit recipe video did not go viral because of me nobody knew or cared about who i was then it went viral because people like pizza people like new york style pizza and they wanted to learn how to make it at home why did they click on my video about pizza instead of all of the others that were out there well one reason is british imperialism british imperialism is why english is the global lingua franca it's the number three language in the world by number of native speakers a very distant three after spanish and the big one which of course is mandarin but english is by far the top second language in the world english is the number one number two english is the language of international business and scholarship and transportation and all kinds of other things and that is because of british imperialism it's the legacy of that i am neither british nor an imperialist or at least i try not to be an imperialist but thanks to the lottery of birth i grew up in a former british colony the united states and thus the global second language is my first language thus i publish videos in comfortable confident native english and that right there gave me access to an enormous global market of particularly educated affluent viewers whom my sponsors want to reach that is an unearned advantage that i had over the 95 percent of humanity whose native language is not english and sure there are almost 400 million other native english speakers in this world and not all of them have very successful youtube channels yet so there are other ingredients to my success but the legacy of british imperialism is a big one and that's one that has nothing to do with my magnetic force of personality or my cooking all of this is to explain how nervous i am right now doing episode one of the new regucia pod i don't assume at all not for a second that lots of people will listen to this show just because lots of people consume another thing i do does not guarantee that they will be hungry for this whatever i plan to do here perhaps i keep shoehorning food metaphors into this little essay because i'm aware that food is the subject that brought you and i together food is the one that brought me to the dance i think i just mixed metaphors in a sentence about metaphors and i can't decide if that's excellent writing or the exact opposite of that anyway in an effort to make the new regula pod successful i will now implore you to do a few things should you wish for this to become successful and therefore go on existing as a thing that you can listen to every saturday which is the tentative release schedule by the way every saturday if you're watching this on youtube do me a solid and subscribe to the podcast feed on your podcatcher of choice i use overcast but apple podcasts google podcast audible stitcher spotify whatever this show should be on all of them at this point the adam regucia podcast search for it and subscribe i will put some links in the description of the youtube video version of this episode head down there and click on one of those to subscribe to the podcast i will be cross posting the episodes to my main youtube channel for now but i've not yet decided if that's going to be a permanent arrangement i have decided that i'm going to do a lot more audience q a here on the pod ask me questions about food life how to break up with your boyfriend how to make a pie whatever you want my answers might be trash but at least they'll be entertaining i hope i will respond here to the questions that i find interesting and where can you leave your questions well for now i'm gonna say go on over to the apple podcasts app leave a rating and a review hopefully a positive one and put your question in the review say something about the show actually review it please and then ask your question in your review for now that is where i will gather questions to answer in the apple podcast reviews for this the adam regucia podcast i'm still not really sure what this show will be but i'm sure that i will talk to other humans on it from time to time and now is one of those times the creator is behind the hottest hot new youtube channel about middle eastern food they are coming up next

know it's got a great title nicely done salma and obi if you watch any of their recipes you probably know obi obi is the one who generally appears on camera on middle eats but his wife salma does almost all the research in the recipe development i adore middle eastern food and i love these too you should subscribe to mid elites on youtube right now who are obi and salma um we're both egyptian right yep and i'm a scientist oh visa i'm a software engineer um basically we started doing this about start of the pandemic really we just wanted a way to share the food that we usually cook for our friends with them so they can make it themselves at home and then it kind of evolved from that well let's just teach everyone how to do middle eastern food um yeah what's your favorite thing that you make oh we've got very different favorite dishes so my favorite dish is an egyptian dish which is rice with crispy bread vinegar and garlic sauce tomato sauce and then lamb and there's lamb stock on it so it's rice with bread which is a bit weird but it's super flavorful i can't choose what i like that's it you have to i have no choice that is a very tough one should have prepared us for this do you know i would like oh falafel definitely falafel yes but the egyptian one what makes an egyptian falafel different um so an egyptian falafel is made with fava beans split fava beans instead of hummus and sorry chickpeas because chickpea hummus is chickpeas in arabic um but yeah that's the egyptian one basically and it tastes very very very different yeah and it's got like tons of greens in there as well and then it's covered in coriander and sesame so when you bite into it you get loads of crunch loads of spice but then a super fluffy interior it's a whipped batter basically it's not it's not like a dense falafel it's very very airy that sounds like a falafel that would not just end my day which is what they normally do to me um well it's funny because like every time you know i i i don't know about you guys but like when i have meals that are just really really heavy on on on fats on lipids like i just get all kinds of horrible stomach problems and like and every time i complain about this on the internet i i get i seem to get somebody from egypt saying oh don't ever come here yeah yeah that is true that is like the the running joke in egypt is that people are so unproductive because the first thing they eat in the morning is fava beans and they got to take a nap straight away that explains the state of the economy there um i wanted to talk to you guys about p-day oh um which for people who don't know is this turkish pizza-like thing which i completely fell in love with when i was going to school in bloomington indiana and there's a restaurant on fourth street called anatolia that i totally recommend everybody go to if you're in southern indiana and uh yeah p day what rp day what is i think it is plural yeah it can't maybe i don't speak turkish so peter is a turkish thing but it is also um you can find it in like the southern caucasus um so like you get it in georgia you get it in armenia you get it in um other countries in that area and basically it's a dough boat with cheese and other toppings in there the famous one you might know is georgian kachapuri or i think that's how you pronounce it which has an egg in there and loads of cheese but then the pea the turkish ones you know you'll get some of them with cheese and meat some of them with vegetables some of feta cheese spinach all sorts of things really it's kind of what's in the middle what's in the dough oh what's in the dough flour water or milk depends on what you want to use and um just a bit of salt it's yeasted as well and a tiny bit of sugar i forget in your video if you all did yogurt in yours did you no i think we did i think we did milk i think we didn't milk in ours um but there was so many different recipes from all over the region so when we're researching we try to find what most people are doing and approximate you know a recipe from that and the yogurt ones look fantastic and they look super soft but milk worked perfectly for us so we didn't bother with yet yeah the thing with yogurt because i love i love making flatbreads with yogurt but the thing is that if you use too much the ph goes too low and it messes with the gluten and you can't you can't it just loses its extensibility it just starts to tear um and i wondered if i was this is purely self-serving i was wondering if you all had figured out a solution to that problem i mean that's the first time i come across that but this is a scientist so she'll she will literally probably what kind of scientist sama uh biomedical sciences so um i look into the microbiome really yes get more specific uh so it's so right now my work is purely computational just because of the pandemic and everything so i didn't have much access to the lab but i'm specifically studying the um gut microbial signature of in ulcerative colitis it's a form of inflammatory bowel disease yeah so based on that so based on research that's already been known we know that most diseases have different gut microbial signatures and um based on um if we try and restore the balance in the gut microbial communities then we could probably alleviate some symptoms or things like that so that's what we're trying to figure out here wow so do you do you buy the hype that like everything about how we feel is coming from our guts actually i am starting to buy into that because everything seems to be connected one way or another to the gut well is it being caused by our gut microbiome is our or is our gut microbiome simply a place where we see um signs of it right it's manifesting signs there but it's not our health is not emanating from this general area down here i mean it is because your immunity actually depends or your immune system is also trained like it works together with the gut microbes so some things you can't digest on your own and the bacteria does that for you and that's why the whole fibrous thing are important when you cut down when you stop eating fibers and you kill off the good bacteria that survive on these kind of things and when you do that then your body doesn't get the right amount of metabolites it needs and the other bacteria start like eating through the lining of your gut and that's when inflammation happens and things like that so it's all it's all connected can i ask you the stupidest gut health question i've always had but been embarrassed i'm gonna be stupider than my ones there's no stupid question i would say there's never a stupid question sometimes there is um okay so beans and similar things that contain you know indigestible oligosaccharides and that kind of stuff right like so they always say that like you know if you start eating beans um or cruciferous vegetables or whatever and like you're having lots of gas like keep eating them and eventually your your system will adjust but what sense does that make because what causes the gas is like the the buggies in your gut that are eating the starches that you cannot or sugars or whatever um hydrocarbons that you cannot digest yourself so if you feed them more aren't you going to grow that colony in there and thereby they'll be eating even more and creating even more gas that seems like it would be this seems counterintuitive to me it it does so it really depends on the i would say the starter culture that you have in your gut so it's different it's so it's your personal sourdough yeah i guess oh that's that's an image thanks opie yeah but i i guess it's different depending on each person and the like the community you already have in your gut and there's so much that we're still learning about this so nothing is is exactly understood like there is no exact equation because there is like it differs the gut microbes differ from one person to another it does vary the main umbra like there are a bunch of microbes that we know the like they fit under a big umbrella but then there are few species that differ not few but quite a lot and it's different between like a healthy gut microbiome can differ between one person to another but there are some microbes that really stand out or are associated with diseases so there's still a lot to learn about this so one thing that could be healthy for another for one person would be unhealthy for another well give it given the the preliminary state of the research is is there anything that you guys do knowing what you know or knowing what salma knows differently in terms of your own diet i mean i'll step back because i'm not exactly considered a healthy prime example of a human so i'll step back but i think um someone you were telling me before that there are a lot of bacteria which work in collaboration with each other so one bacteria might i mean i i don't say this is how it works but one bacteria might produce gas and process something but another bacteria might feed off of that gas or something else they have a symbiotic relationship so it may be and this is completely me making things up but it may be it may be that the gas being produced is actually the food for another kind of bacteria and once you build up enough of that you know enough of the microbes that can make the gas you build up a colony of the other bacteria i have no clue but it's the it's the short chain fatty acids so fiber fiber is like the most important thing and what people tend to forget people tend to think fiber equals greens so they just focus on having veggies but they don't really know that the most sort like wheats and beans and legumes and things like that have a very very high amount of fibers and it's fibers that fuel the microbiome the bacteria in the gut and you have a certain group group of bacteria that break down these fibers into what we call short chain fatty acids and then um they break the break them down these short chain fatty acids are then broken down further but by another group of bacteria that then um produce butyrate which is a very important uh short chain fatty acid which is required for you know just keeping the energy up in the gut and feeding the bacteria and keeping it all good and healthy because otherwise they'll when they starve when you don't give when you don't have fibers then they start eating the lining that protects your gut and um so i've been trying at least to eat a lot of fibers you know i used to go oh no carb low carb all that stuff and then i realized oh that is pretty bad that is not good that is probably really upsetting my gut so yeah fascinating so youtube yes you guys first of all you got to do a video about this stuff you got to start getting in some gut health i'd be fascinated to learn about that but i guess i shouldn't give you any tips because your channel is doing tremendously well as it is yeah it's doing it's doing pretty good i think um we're we're we're currently at about 185 000 subscribers which i think the metric isn't subscribers that you really care about it's more about the reach and like the views and stuff you get so yeah i always tell people that subscribers are cumulative a lot a lot of people don't will subscribe to something and then like never watch anything there again so it's more an indication of how long you've been big rather than of how big you are and but you guys are getting great views i mean have you thought about quitting your jobs or you both have like meaningful important jobs though i mean as long as my as long as my boss doesn't see this yes i've definitely thought about quitting my job i think about it 50 times a day yeah i mean we would love to do this full-time or at least i would um you know it's the kind of thing that i think adds a lot more value than me just sitting in my day job i mean i'm a software engineer but other than that it's not that interesting it's not that exciting and whereas this food like you get messages from people who are like you're reconnecting me with my culture or i visited this place with you know like my my my grandma who passed away or or this relative used to make something for me or i never knew you know i'm adopted from this country or that country and i haven't tried the food and you're helping me try it and i think that to me is just amazing it's better than any job out there but there's a downside too right i mean to me like for a guy like me like if you tell me that you know yeah you're egyptian but this is how you know the turks make p-day i'm gonna be like sure okay fine but like i i bet that with in terms of the intra middle eastern food politics of it that like you probably get some people saying that is not how we do it and how dare you misrepresent oh yeah this represents my culture i mean we get that from egyptians actually so and and we're egyptians but it's just it some it's very hard for some people to understand that different houses do things or different families do recipes differently um i don't know why but yeah i mean it does happen all the time well i think maybe people make an assumption that you know if they they look at you and they know that you are they they feel that you are removed from their culture they see you as an outsider right yeah and therefore if they see you doing something different with the food they assume that the reason for that difference is because you are an outsider and that's not always the case right like because i'll run into this all the time where you know i will very cautiously like i just did this uh um i just uh the uh paella recipe and i knew i was asking for trouble right um so i just researched the  out of it right like i just i mean and i and i i i can read spanish so i was like looking at all kinds of traditional recipes and their native language and uh and uh yeah but people still they'll say like oh that's not how we do it and the thing is and i have what i have to hold my tongue but what i what i want to say is like actually a lot of you do do it that way and i have the primary source documentation to back up that claim so the reason that i'm doing it differently might not be because i'm an outsider it might just be because there's like different ways of doing it but definitely people in your neighborhood are doing this right now dude and i'm sorry that i seem to know that and you don't that seems wrong which is why i'm not going to say it out loud but it's true yeah yeah 100 for every single recipe that we do selma does a ton of research we're talking about like a good 10 to 15 hours just of thorough watching videos looking at blog posts understanding reading recipe books looking through all sorts of things and we're talking about like for example we did a moroccan breakfast recently someone had to watch a good i don't know 10 hours of people making bread and they don't even speak um regular arabic or like normal arabic and morocco they speak a blend of arabic and french so it's really hard to figure these things out and of course we got people saying oh yeah you never use butter you never use oil but then you get people whether in the videos themselves are like no no use oil use butter and in the end of the day every single person does it differently and what you'll find in even countries like egypt even countries like morocco the vast majority of families they probably won't even make most of the food from scratch so we do everything on the channel from scratch as much as possible so that anyone can make it and we do it a way that works well but in egypt you'll find most people oh yeah they get this pre-rolled they get this pre-breaded they get this pre-fried and they just heat it up because you know modern convenience right that's how things are done um and most of the differences you find are either like from different villages different towns different cities maybe even different streets and in some places the difference between identity of you know this this village's version of the dish versus this one it's lost and it all kind of like amalgamates into one recipe and in other places it's so different like um in in some countries you know in the levant you will literally get one village or one road will do it this way and this other road will do it this other way and we gotta try find like like something that meets in the middle to not upset people but it's really nice when people come back and they're like oh yeah my mom does it the same way as you or you know like my grandma does it and it tastes just like my grandma's one or things like that and then i think that's really cool it's like in the end of the day some people might be like yeah this is not correct but does it taste right does it taste authentic i think that's the cool part yeah but that that's what happened with the fessen jun the iranian dish because it's really hard to do uh research for iranian recipes because most of the videos are in persian and you know there's no way i can understand that and they're not translated um and we had and like all the um videos that i had seen that were in english just something seemed so off about them you know there was just so much pomegranate molasses like why would you're too little no no no no no so much there was like a cup and a half of like pomegranate celestia that is just diabetes in a you know in a dish and um and i actually like spoke to one of my co-workers and uh i asked her she's she's half iranian and i was like does this seem right to you because it does not seem right to me and she's like no that's not how you are completely right uh your you know my grandma does it that way and she only adds like three tablespoons at most and it's it's it's things like that so it's just so difficult to to find the right balance uh but when you do in the end it it feels good and then when that recipe went out um we got a lot of comments from from a lot of persians saying like yeah that looks very authentic i'm glad to see that you completely ground down the walnuts because most of the recipes out there like that the ones in english had like bits and pieces of walnuts yeah yeah like that doesn't seem right like i don't want to lumpy sauce you know but uh it's it's good it's very gratifying when when you do get comments like that well by by making it big on youtube with a channel called middle eats do you fear that you have um built a house for yourself that's too too big or too small like is it too broad or too narrow so so the journey that we've been on so far has been to make um authentic and existing original dishes as authentically as possible so if there is a step that we don't understand we will sometimes include it and i know this is something that you hate like when you will not hate but you you like to argue against it's that things that you know people seem to do for tradition we tend to do them mainly because they're part of the original recipe in the future we definitely do want to branch out because i mean there is modern middle eastern cuisine the food we eat isn't necessarily the food that we make right now on the channel there are you know all sorts of strange things going on in the middle east of cuisine you know there's loads of western influences in middle eastern cuisine as well and so we definitely want to do things along along like middle eastern line but maybe branch out do more like um and and you know the four-part word is fusion here but like do more dishes that are you know outside of the the regular spectrum middle eastern food and then like there are other things we've got to do too i mean someone's a fantastic baker um and i'm not just saying that like you know but people say oh yeah they're fantastic baker and they make betty crocker stuff she's make wedding cakes she made like she made a birthday cake last weekend she makes like loads of um amazing she's a scientist it's science it literally is it literally is i think people don't realize how scientific cooking is it's a process it's a fault in particular there's a reason i only make flatbreads because i can fake it like i don't need to actually know how things work yeah and so maybe in the future we'd look at branching out and doing more things maybe not necessarily under that brand name but you know me and selma with our experience on youtube i think we could build something again but um now we're still just focused on the middle east brand at the moment and i also think that the middle east brand i think we're just scratching the surface oh yeah no you could easily you could fill a lifetime yeah sure yeah i mean there's a lot that people don't know i mean we have discovered so much about middle eastern food by just doing that because all what we've known was you know egyptian food um above yeah foods from the levant but nothing too you know um detailed like like we have been getting into and i think it's just amazing we've discovered so many new dishes that just blew our minds so yeah but then again you're in the uk right so do you ever just want to like make a shepherd's pie um i mean we don't we don't cook middle eastern food on a daily basis that's not our it's just so much work so middle eastern food is takes just you know there's a lot of washing up that goes with middle eastern cooking so many pots and pans and it just takes so much time you know because it's just the way um house or like the way things are structured you know there's always a stay-at-home mom she's always cooking all day and that's the way it is but uh we go for convenience during the weekdays or most of the time you know the only times that we used to cook middle eastern food was when we had our friends over you know reminisce feeling homesick okay let's invite everyone for a big middle eastern meal and we would be happy everyone would be happy and i mean regardless i mean generally we we cook um just general western food you know we got pizza we cook pastas we cook you know steaks we have steak like every month we do we do just the regular stuff um and there's plenty of people doing that on youtube i think with us the the our niche is middle eastern food and there aren't many channels doing what we do not in english yeah exactly yeah there's there's millions of them not really it's probably thousands of massive channels in arabic um because it's such a big thing in the middle east to watch food cooker food videos but um for us we want to really make bring the middle east and kitchen into you know and the average home in you know somewhere in the u.s we had last year in the texas snowstorms we had someone message us and say that they had cooked some egyptian kosheri which is egypt's national dish they cooked egyptian crusher before the snowstorm and they just kept eating it throughout the whole snow so they had no power and they were just eating it cold and i found it cool because it was just like some random town in texas or something like that right and i was just like oh yeah it's really cool we got kosher into some random household in some random town in texas and i think it's it's really cool that you know we're not doing shepherd's pie we're not doing pizzas we're not doing the things that people generally have heard of but then we're getting random people from all over the world cooking random dishes that you know only a middle eastern would know of yeah like also the someone from germany message saying that they um they do molokreia which is like a jute uh leaf stew kind of thing um what kind of leaf jute jute leaf so you know mallow the plant the mallow plant it's literally the leaves of mallow it's called juice mallow as well um and the leaves um or cocos or something like that and the leaves are like ground like chopped up really fine and they have a almost um okra texture so it's a bit slimy and it's made into a stew it's eaten all over the middle east in different ways um yeah yeah and i mean it's one of my favorite dishes but i wouldn't have that on a weekly basis i mean it's so heavy on garlic and and like it's a heavy meal you feel bloated afterwards but you know i just find it amazing and it's a lot of effort because you have to make like proper chicken stock for it and like it takes a good three hours to make it you know and i just found it so surprising you know and when someone was like oh i make this on a weekly basis now and i love it it's one of my favorite dishes and um it makes me happy you know to to raise that kind of um awareness because what do people know about middle eastern food besides shawarma hummus falafel kebabs that's it right i mean those are all really good things though like don't yeah no no they are they are but it's it's i feel like it's a it's a label like this is this is all what middle eastern food is when it isn't yeah i am constantly confused and delighted by the magic of kabobs because i don't understand why they're so good because it's just on a stick like you didn't cook anything like sticks like why does the stick make it taste so good it doesn't make any sense it's the fire and the onions yeah yeah there's there's this whole technique of like making of marinating food in onions or onion juice in the middle east different countries use maybe the onion pulp the onion juice or the whole onion shredded and it adds moisture into the meat where it doesn't dry out like you know if you cook a burger and you cook it well done it's going to dry out right whereas a kebab they're not really that dry so the kneading of the onion into the meat just adds moisture back in very strange i'm sure like somebody's gonna be like this isn't how it works but it gives us the effect and that's all that matters right yeah and you can get a really good sear and loads of meaty flavor like you can do with like a burger or something like that but it's still super super moist i think that's you know the reason why it's so delicious and kebabs from different regions taste completely different you know like egyptian kebab tastes very different than levantine kebab and iranian and iranian kebab turkish kebab so so different best kebab that's a good one if you have if i had to choose one kebab dish for the rest of my life it would be um bati kebab which is a turkish adana kebab and then it's got cheese on top of it it's put in a dora a flatbread kind of like a tortilla lavash bread and then there's cut up into slices tomato sauce and you dip it in yogurt you just take the dipped kebab so good it is a very good one that sounds like something that would end my day yeah it does it does it does end your day well you all are just lovely and i'm so happy that you you're you're finding success and i'm i'm i'm eating it up anything else that we should talk about before we say goodbye um let me just think uh i guess it's just i think with us we we we're trying to just focus a a part of what we we're we're trying to make middle eastern culture more than just you know what you hear on the news and what you might know about it um you know middle east is a really rich region with a really rich culinary history we're talking about the middle east and kitchen can go is is written down you know from like these books a thousand years old almost uh and and those recipes in a part still exist so it's really cool that there's people like max miller on youtube who you've probably seen cooking uh with max miller he he does a lot of historical recipes and we're having really good fun discovering these things rediscovering um old foods and you know trying to trace things back um and yeah it's it's been great you know showing it off to people and yeah we hope to see more people joining and following and cooking the dishes from all over the world well listeners you know what you need to do middle eats on the youtube hit em up yeah yeah that would be great we will have all of you there we'll show you loads of delicious recipes and yeah we'll get you cooking middle eastern food in no time and they're the best subscribe to middle eats on youtube if you will be observing ramadan coming up soon you can get all kinds of ideas for meals to slam when the sun goes down as i record this they just posted a recipe called egypt's answer to lasagna it's called macaroni bacia mel which is exactly what it sounds like awesome stuff and that's it for the debut regucia pod again if you want to ask a queue for q a leave an actual review and rating for this show on apple podcasts and put your question in there feels weird to deliver a show outro without music i have no music for this pod yet because i'm not sure if i want it to have music my whole thing is to give you the goods without the fluff and music would be fluff on a food podcast this is all very ironic because i am a composer by training and i originally got into radio because i thought that it would be a way for me to slip my own music into things and then i got famous on youtube for being the guy who does not lard up his recipe videos with music and stuff and people would even write in the comments oh it's so nice that you don't use music and so yeah ironic this is the end of the show despite the absence of music i'm sure a tagline will develop in time some kind of signature sign off uh for right now i'll just say uh yeah thanks for listening thanks for watching if you're watching but please subscribe to the actual podcast if you're watching on youtube and yeah talk to you next week,3
Pan-fried vegetable ravioli,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/blfy-bOODuM/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLBTfqLhBRm6hyE_WVZgk3bwr1r_RA,blfy-bOODuM,"8 minutes, 51 seconds","Go to https://thld.co/sheath_ragusea_0322 and use code RAGUSEA at checkout to get 20% off your order!

My previous ravioli video that shows...",2022-11-24 14:47:05.183328, i've finally figured out a vegetable ravioli filling that i like something really bright and fresh that does not use meat or cheese as a binder i got it by imitating tibetan style dumplings that i've had vegetable momo they're called momo are traditionally made with a simple water and flour dough which you could totally do here but because i'm doing italian style ravioli i'm doing an egg pasta dough two eggs in a bowl for a dozen big ravioli and if i have an extra yolk candy i use that but today i don't so i'm using a small glug of olive oil it's not the same but has a similar effect of enriching the dough now it's just a matter of mixing in as much flour as i can which will probably end up being about a cup and a half maybe 200 grams at most i just mix in as much as i can with an implement because this is the really sticky messy part and when i can't do anything more with that i'll start hand kneading just giving the dough as much flour as it will take it's easier to do this on a flat surface but if you want to keep the mess contained for now you can do it in the bowl pasta dough really doesn't have to be thoroughly needed at this stage this kneading is more about just getting the flour particles in there so they can hydrate that's probably good enough i could get a little more flour in there but for ravioli especially i don't mind if my dough is still a little sticky to the touch that'll make it easier to work later the real trick is to cover and let the dough rest for 20 or 30 minutes before you roll it out during which time filling a shallot a small zucchini a carrot and a few garlic cloves i'll cut the root ends off of those and then rather than smashing them i will roll the cloves between my hands this loosens the skin so you can just peel it off while keeping the cloves whole and intact i also want the shallot hole so i'm just doing a shallow cut to peel off the outer skin i want these things whole because i'm going to grate them grated veg is the perfect texture and shape for a dumpling filling and the zucchini is really the key ingredient that sticky mucilaginous slime in there is the binder for the filling and i'm sure any other kind of summer squash would work instead now the carrot grating gets you pieces that are fine enough to hold together in a coherent filling but not so fine is to end up like a mushy goo any other kind of onion would work just fine for this i like shallots because they're small i'll switch to the small holes for the garlic i don't think the grater is the best tool for garlic i'm just using it because it's here there that's the filling now we just got to cook it down in a little olive oil you don't have to use a pan this wide i'm just using it because i'm going to need a wide pan later for the particular presentation i'm doing on these ravioli i'm going to pan fry them i'll just stir those veggies as i cook them gently for five minutes max i'm not trying to brown anything i just want to soften and concentrate these done heat off i'll give them a pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper stir taste for seasoning and we're done the flour in my dough has hydrated the gluten proteins have autolyzed and at this point rolling the dough will be all the kneading that it requires today i'm doing one big sheet of dough on my counter with a rolling pin and some flour for dusting if you don't have a big easily cleaned working surface like this in your kitchen i've got another gnome machine method you can do with just a little cutting board where you use a pint glass to roll out one little bit of dough at a time that video is linked in the description the rolling pin is more efficient for making a large quantity of ravioli even though i'm only making like two portions today for demonstration purposes roll and turn roll and turn turning ensures that your dough won't get hopelessly stuck to your work surface with a rolling pin i think it's basically impossible to roll pasta dough too thin so just get it as thin as you can and that's it that looks ready to contain my filling almost as capably as my boxer briefs from the sponsor of this video sheath these brilliant skivvies were invented by a u.s army veteran who grew weary of uniquely male friction-related discomfort whilst marching around iraq see there's distinct compartments for the zucchini another for the garlic cloves and then everything is held up and away from them thighs all is contained yet ventilated the semi-synthetic fabric is super smooth and soft and breathable and cool to the touch but for cold weather you can even get a full body sheath base layer there's tons of different designs and colors products for women too click my link in the description use code ragusia at checkout for 20 off your sheath don't settle for a containment that just mashes all your fillings together sheath underwear dot com slash regucia for 20 off with my code ragusia at checkout thank you sheath okay so i'm just going to use an upside down pint glass to punch out rounds for circular ravioli press hard and then twist to cut the rim of the pint glass is the opposite of sharp which means it might take a little extra pushing and twisting to get these out but the upside is it's not scratching my counter at all the cutting board really wouldn't be big enough for this once you've got out as many rounds as you can you can gather up the trimmings and ideally you'd want to let that rest a little while before rolling it out again let the added flower hydrate and let the gluten relax i don't have time for that so i'll just do the best i can no way i'm gonna get this as thin as the first rolling but whatever punch punch one two three four five six twenty three ah i need one more it has to be an even number each of these is either a base or a lid 24 circles means 12 ravioli now i can deposit little balls of filling gotta remember to only put this on half the circles and i really am balling it up before i put it down i don't want little strands of vegetables sticking out into the edges where they might break the seal speaking of which i'll definitely need a little dish of water handy to wet the edge before i seal on the lids when you roll out all of your shapes in advance like this yeah that's super efficient but it also gives time for the surface of the pasta to dry out and these would be impossible to seal together without a little extra water as glue just peel the ravioli up off the counter immediately after you've sealed it or it'll be glued to the ground once sealed ravioli are very freezable i would not boil them first i would just lay them on trays in a single layer so they don't freeze together throw them in the freezer overnight bag them up once they're hard you can make 100 ravioli on a weekend and then monday night just throw them frozen into the boiling water they'll thaw and cook in minutes these are good to boil now though you could go back with the pint glass one more time to clean up the edges each ravioli should be a little wider now than our original mold because we stretched it out as we sealed the edges together this final punch out probably has the added benefit of reinforcing that seal though i've got a hole in one of them and there's really no way to fix that now this is why i usually prefer to roll out one bit of pasta at a time the dough stays wetter and more flexible that way it doesn't go dry and brittle like this sorry i steamed your face there extra salt whenever i make fresh egg pasta i always think the water needs twice as much salt as i would put in for dry pasta and then i'll drop in the ravioli a few at a time so they don't stick to each other even the one with a hole in it it won't be pretty but it'll cook up just fine these should take like three minutes before they've all visibly puffed up lightened in color a little bit and started floating eagerly to the top like little buoys it's hard to mess up boiling fresh egg pasta anywhere between two and four minutes seems to yield nearly identical results to me i'mma drain these pretty thoroughly normally i would hold back some pasta water in the pot for sauce but today i need these dry because i'm gonna pan fry their surfaces you don't have to do this you could just toss these in some tomato sauce or something but i like to melt some butter in a wide pan oil would be fine moderate heat and as you lay the boiled ravioli and you got to move them either swish them around or shake the pan or both if you don't keep them moving they'll stick hopelessly to the pan i love this method but you can only fry one portion at a time five or six big ravioli in a pan fortunately this only takes a minute so you could fry multiple portions in rapid succession get them as brown as you want before flipping them a little bit of browning goes a very long way if you take it further than that they start to taste a little doughnut-y at the last minute i might throw in some fresh parsley or sage leaves to fry a little bit that's parsley you could eat these just like this maybe with some cheese on top but if you want a saucy or texture you could turn the heat off and deglaze with just a little white wine in this case or stock or reserved pasta water just a splash of liquid to deglaze the pan and that would also be good as is but you could wait for the bubbling to pretty much stop and then melt in a little more butter unlike the browned butter this butter has intact casein proteins that'll form an emulsion with everything else that's in the pan get you a nice velvety sauce if you use unsalted butter you might need to stir in some salt now give the sauce a taste before you spill this out onto a plate gorgeous if you fry the surface of ravioli it makes them a little tougher to cut through but that chew is delicious in the mouth and check how well that filling is holding together with only the zucchini as a binder the texture of that filling is just so smooth and fresh i love it and thanks to little tibet in bloomington indiana for giving me the idea with your delicious vegetable momo i've eaten a million times call these marco polo ravioli,3
Why a tire company is the judge of fine dining,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gsHnfeS1UgQ/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLAFw_SRZGOdKEsDdKUfecLCKmG5GA,gsHnfeS1UgQ,"10 minutes, 15 seconds","Thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this video!

squarespace question how did an anthropomorphic stack of tires end up as the global authority on fine dining yes the michelin guide that famously assigns one to three stars to only the finest and snootiest of restaurants all around the world this is made by the same people who make tires oh i'm sorry brits by tyre of course i mean tire michele is michelin though i will be switching between the french and american pronunciations for the purposes of rhetoric and humor michelin and nishlan are the same company this is funny because when most of us today think about car tires we think of the blue collar automotive repair and maintenance services industry honest and essential but low status in contrast the kind of restaurant deemed worthy of a single michelin star let alone three is generally a haunt of the elite international business class the global aristocracy eats here and man do they pay for it the kind of people whom i imagine eat at these places the closest they ever get to a tire is when they reach their hand out of the window of their peugeot to tip the valet so again how did the inedible rubber cousin of the pillsbury doughboy end up telling the bourgeoisie where to dine well we have to go back way back before the automobile became a mere utilitarian object ubiquitous across all classes in developed countries indeed you could say that cars are really tools of the lower classes these days since the super-rich can afford to live in ultra dense urban centers like manhattan where they have everything they need at their fingertips and great public transportation the rest of the normals out there don't have that so they have to drive cars in the late 19th century there were just a few hundred automobiles in all of france this is according to historian herbert lotman author of the michelin men driving an empire lautman writes these early utus remained rich men's toys unable to stray very far from the vicinity of a reliable repair shop even if it didn't break down all the time you would be a fool to drive your water very far from your maison even if you got where you were going there's no guarantee someone would be selling petrol there for you to get back home there's no guarantee you would find where you were going because there was no numbering system for french roads and maps were kind of unreliable oh and get this if you blow a tire you're going to be stuck on the side of the road for at least a day this is because the first generation of pneumatic tires were glued to the wheel rim to replace the tire you'd have to glue on a new one and let it dry overnight this is until french brothers edouard and andre mishlan came up with the basic design everybody still uses to this day where the tire is held in place by tension not glue the michelin brothers were heirs to a family farm equipment factory and their first tires were for bicycles not cars the younger brother eduard he actually ran the factory out in the provinces the older brother andre he stayed in paris and handled marketing and public relations at which he was a stone-cold genius today andre michelin is hailed as a pioneer of indirect marketing he understood that the market from michelin tires would be tiny until rubber wheel based transportation became way more practical and enjoyable and accessible to the masses michelan is very much the french counterpart of the american industrialist henry ford these are men who fully believed that if they could just advance mass production along with mass consumption well then they could make everybody rich especially themselves and i suppose they were right from here on i'm drawing heavily from this book by american historian stephen harp making michelin advertising and cultural identity in 20th century france the myslam brothers did a number of things to promote the automobile lifestyle in france and thereby stimulate demand for their product they sponsored races which were inevitably won by the vehicles with michelin tires because michelin tires were legit way better than their earliest competitors when michelin got into the airplane business they offered prizes for various feats of early aviation they promoted a national road numbering system in france they made better maps and they still make maps to this day and they made the michelin guide the first edition of which published in 1900 they gave it out for free it was a list of all of the establishments in france that a motorist might need repair shops petrol stations hotels and restaurants the growth of this new automobile lifestyle in france was very much interrelated with the growth of gastronomy in france and the birth of the french restaurant industry which is really the birth of the western restaurant industry that's a history we'll talk more about another day but it all has roots in the french revolution the notion that the common man could ennoble himself by accessing and learning to appreciate the finer things in life things that had previously been reserved for the hereditary aristocracy a noble table embiggens the smallest man that promise of the early restaurant industry is very much the same promise of the automobile industry that it was going to empower the common man to become his own lord to get behind the wheel of his own life it is of course ironic that this dream of industrial egalitarianism in france was built upon the subjugation of people in french colonies like vietnam where they grew the rubber trees for the tires but anyway as stephen harp observes in his book michelin tires quickly lost their competitive advantages in the early 20th century from the uk came dunlop tires i apparently have dunlop tires myself from the u.s came goodyear and goodrich and firestone tires but michelle was able to maintain its position in the french market by making itself a symbol of french nationalism and indeed more than a symbol an instrument of french nationalism michelan became the number one funder of the natalist movement in france which tried to persuade french women to have more babies make more frenchmen and the guide itself became an instrument of nationalism because it empowered and encouraged parisians to go out venture forth into the provinces and michelin's promotion of french gastronomy was also an instrument of nationalism france had come to define itself as the western capital of fine food and drink california had the movie industry france had the restaurant industry and the guide became the academy awards of cooking to the uninitiated one star might seem like a terrible review until you learn that the vast majority of eating establishments get absolutely zero stars even really great places get zero stars in recent additions michelin has tried to introduce non-star designations to recognize places that have awesome food but they don't rise to the level of michelin-starred cuisine which is generally super fancy and super fussy in publishing guides for places beyond france michelin became an instrument of french imperialism judging restaurants in new york and tokyo by the standards of french fine dining thereby influencing chefs all around the world to internalize those french standards check this out this is the most recent edition of amishland guide and in the preface where they explain their methodology they reassure you dear reader that their highest awards are considered at a european level this of course implies that restaurants outside of europe are inherently inferior and they would need to be graded on a curve in order to come in anywhere close to the european restaurants in fact michelin currently awards its maximum of three stars to about 30 restaurants in france but only 13 in the united states and three in china these are countries far larger than france and countries where i assure you there is no shortage of good stuff to eat now in fairness to michelin they do not claim to review every single high-level restaurant in a place like china as they do in western european countries here in the states michelin only reviews restaurants in new york chicago washington dc and california and there is definitely michelin star level food happening in portland and new orleans and boston but michelin isn't even trying to review it yet as a result the michelin guide is not nearly as influential and famous here in the states as it is in europe maybe it is in new york but overall i would say that the real oscars of cooking in the united states are the james beard awards even though the james beard awards go to chefs not to restaurants and that is a meaningful distinction but anyway all of that explains why the tire guy is the european arbiter of fine dining whether

cut of beef we cook the greens in the meaty pan while the steak rests and garnish with pickled mustard seeds my new favorite thing they have the texture of caviar and you can make them the day of but they get better as they age in the fridge for a few days i just bought a bottle of mustard seeds in the spice isle at my mainstream grocery store but you can buy whole mustard seeds for much less money here in the states if you go to an asian grocery first thing i'm gonna do is just cover them in plain water and bring them to a boil while i wait i have a shallot and red chili i will dice both of these to pickle with the seeds they'll taste nice and provide some color seeds have come to a boil you can see they've already plumped up a fair a bit i will drain them and then even give them a little rinse blanching the mustard seeds helps purge some of the bitter compounds inside them the same things that make mustard greens and other cruciferous vegetables bitter some people even repeat the blanching process a few times i'm not going to bother a little bitterness doesn't bother me and there's reason to believe those compounds are good for you antioxidant now i will more than cover them in vinegar i'm using rice vinegar because my whole dish today is using east asian flavors and rice vinegar is usually my all-purpose vinegar anyway some people use a mixture of vinegar and water i like my pickles tart with that i will put in a handful of sugar you could skip that or use less these actually came out a little too sweet for me i'll give them a couple of pinches of salt and then bring to a boil i can resume dicing my vegetables i'll get that shallot all cut up i just want the pieces to be roughly the same size as the mustard seeds once cooked now this second boiling in vinegar i like to do for 10 minutes at most i find that gets them plump while still preserving their caviar-like crunch i'm sure the time will depend on the kind of mustard seeds you're using and you can simply taste them to assess their doneness if i need to add more vinegar or water to keep them submerged i will but in general i'm trying to minimize the liquid to concentrate the mucilage coming out of the seeds i want a thick creamy condiment for my steak for the last two minutes or so of cooking i'll throw in my vegetables i don't like for them to boil too long and get all mushy but a little boiling will help extract some flavor and color from them very quickly heat off and we're done here i'll give it a taste it's a hair too sweet which i can't really fix it needs salt that i can fix you could use this right now hot i'm going to throw it into a container let it cool and then chill in the fridge if you're just making refrigerator pickles you don't have to be fussy with your sanitation your chemistry you just make them taste good to you they'll last in the fridge for at least a couple of weeks and basically get better and better time to actually make dinner i'm gonna peel and mince some garlic and ginger for my greens you could skip this or just do one or the other the greens will get a ton of flavor simply from the beef but garlic and ginger make pretty much anything better greens i was going to use a bag of pre-washed pre-trimmed mustard greens to go with my mustard theme but i saw this purple curly kale at the store and i just had to have it i love purple and curly greens are so good at grabbing sauce and bringing it to your mouth i'm just trimming the stems out of each of these leaves you don't have to get the whole thing out just the really thick part sometimes i throw the stems in the compost but today i want to eat them fiber is good for me since i'm doing a very quick cook on these greens i'm going to slice the stems very thinly this will allow them to cook super fast in the hot pan and i'll need to set them aside in a separate bowl because they're going to go in before the leaves which i will hack through somewhat indiscriminately this may seem like an astounding amount of greens but for a meal like this you really need like two whole bunches for three or four people because they cook down enormously most of the volume here is just air you may have noticed a pattern with today's ingredients dark greens and garlic and ginger and mustard and lean fresh red meat these are all foods that studies have associated with modest increases in testosterone seeing as i'm turning 40 in a couple weeks i have been tracking my hormone levels with the sponsor of this video let's get checked let's get checked offers all kinds of tests you can order over the internet and do at home everything from sexual health to cholesterol and thyroid and diabetes stuff it is my own damn business why i want to track my testosterone and i don't feel the need to always get a permission slip from a doctor or the dumpster fire that is the american health insurance system the pricing with let's get checked is reasonable and transparent this whole operation is run by real physicians who review the results the labs you mail your samples to are accredited and if you've got a serious problem a nurse will get in touch but you can always just see your results online my tea appears to have been going down that may be from aging or from regrettable lifestyle choices or just some random short-term variation i need to do several tests over time to get a clear picture of what's happening and if i really do seem to have a problem i'll talk to my doctor about it right now i'm just trying better diet and exercise if you want to test your hormone levels without having to leave home visit trylgc.com adam ragusia use my code adam30 you'll get 30 off your test with my link and code in the description thank you let's get checked so the cut of steak i'm using today is known in american butchery as sirloin it's kind of the transition between the expensive tender cuts of the animal's back and the tough cheap cuts of its hindquarters british and australasian butchers generally refer to cuts from this area as rump steak the biggest muscle in it is the gluteus medius there's actually a little bit of tenderloin there and then there are a few other muscles that start to run down into the hip you'll find sirloins butchered all kinds of ways what i like to do is cut out the individual muscles cut along that intermuscular or seam fat and then trim it off get rid of it along with any connective tissue in there if you're not sure where the seams are between the muscles just pull the seams will tear naturally up to a point if i separate all the muscles out i can remove all of the gristle and blubbery bits of fat that a lot of people would eat around anyway on their plate and this means i'll be able to cook each muscle a little differently some will need more time than others post trimming that's maybe around a pound and a quarter of meat just over half a kilo enough for three or four people i'd say what we americans call sirloin here is relatively inexpensive it is a true steak meaning it's cut against the grain of the muscle fibers and in my opinion sirloin has the best flavor of any true steak that is a very lean and b still pretty tender big beef flavor with fewer calories i'll get my widest pan heating over high flame if you have a very powerful electric stove you'd probably want medium or medium high i'll get my ventilation pumping there's gonna be some smoke enough salt and pepper for both sides of the steaks i'll rub it all around in just a second today i'm also doing a tiny little bit of chinese five spice it's very strong so just a little bit drizzle with a little oil and then i'll rub everything everywhere i actually wish i'd put on a little more oil than i did this meat is so lean it needs a little extra fat on the surface to get a nice golden crust i'll put the biggest pieces in first because they'll need more time i'm pressing to make sure i get good contact with the pan and whenever possible i very much favor the constant flipping method of cooking steak flip every 30 seconds or so i'll poke to get a baseline reading of what these particular steaks feel like when they are raw on the inside i think near constant flipping does cook the meat a little more evenly but more importantly it gives you situational awareness if the pan is too hot you're gonna see the meat just starting to burn before it's too late to turn the heat down which i did do here that little bit with a piece of filet on it is already done so out it comes another reason i like using a wide relatively thin cut for this particular recipe is the pan is mostly covered in meat and that will minimize the uncovered area on which the fond is likely to burn at stake searing temperatures i want to cook my greens in here in a minute and if there's a ton of burned fond that's going to make my veggies taste bad plus burned meat is potentially carcinogenic alrighty when the center of the steak feels like it's just firming up relative to that baseline poke i did at the beginning that means i'm getting into medium rare territory which is what i want it's also a good sign if i see pink juice starting to surface as i get down to the last big pieces i will turn my heat way down or else everything is going to burn a decent crust on those that would have been nicer if i'd used more oil okay my kale stems go in first they need a couple minute head start to get soft and again because that meat was so lean i think i need some more oil in there for quicker cooking i use extra virgin olive oil for nearly everything by the way my heat is on about medium stir stir stir and when i can see those pieces starting to soften i'll stir in my garlic and ginger and immediately after i'll start putting in my leaves if you gotta push on them for a second you can get them cooking a little faster no worries if you can't fit them all in yet depending on how wet the leaves were you might need to splash in some water to help deglaze the pan and keep the aromatics from burning also just to serve as a thermal interface to get the leaves cooking down these leaves had just enough water on and in them already now that they've shrunk a bit i can fit in the rest and i'm gonna hit these with a little thai fish sauce but you could use soy sauce or worcestershire or again even just water it's been four minutes since the leaves went in and they looked just about done to me i'll taste for seasoning they don't need any more salt because the fish sauce was salty i am going to summon forth the upside down bear even a little honey really knocks back the bitterness of dark greens and makes them glossy we are done off the heat now the meat is perfectly rested and ready to carve i'm doing thin strips at an angle mainly just to make it pretty and easy to eat this is not like flank steak where you have to slice it thin to make it chewable you can serve these steaks whole i just love cooking meat and then cooking my veg in the same pan while the meat rests because thick cuts of meat need to rest but vegetables do not they are best hot and fresh right out of the pan so it's synergistic and the greens are so hot they'll actually reheat the slices of beef here's my mustard seed caviar straight out of the fridge i like the temperature contrast but you could heat it up or simply eat it right after you boiled it i obviously have way more mustard seeds than i'll need for this meal but that's fine i will eat them on nearly everything i cook for the next week or two they're awesome on eggs honestly those are better than caviar in my opinion and unlike caviar they are inexpensive good for you and totally sustainable i've got a few cilantro leaves on there by the way but they're hardly necessary i do not cook a lot of steak at home anymore for many reasons but i will definitely be doing this one again an excellent post-workout meal,3

reach for is chicken legs if you have skinny legs you are said to have chicken legs this is ironic because your typical modern broiler chicken has tom platt's level legs big grammy thighs dorian yates calves chickens do not have chicken legs why the widespread false impression to the contrary well it's because the part of the chicken that we think is its leg is actually its foot and chickens do have skinny feet hello i'm adam ragusia i make internet videos about food that a surprisingly large number of people seem to like watching and i have a large reserve of acoustical foam in my house so i figured why not start a podcast i was supposed to be a podcaster i was a radio reporter for many years and i was around for the initial podcast explosion and i had my hand in various pods even as i was teaching at a university full-time and it is because i am a pod person that i made my first cooking videos i made them because i needed to teach video and i knew nothing about video some would say i still do not but anyway i made some fun food videos for practice because all i knew about was audio stuff and then one of those videos blew up randomly about four years ago and now here we are all of this is to say that with the new podcast i am back and it feels good to be home in the pod i am happy to have hardly any plan about what this show will be all i can tell you is that i'm planning to release an episode every release schedule to be determined the episodes will start with a little riff about whatever is on my mind that week and i'm calling it little aspirationally knowing me it will probably get absurdly long pretty fast and then after i do that riff i will have a conversation with somebody anybody interesting who eats like imma talk to obi and salma from the cooking channel middle eats which is exactly what it sounds like because it's really hard to do research for iranian recipes because most of the videos are in persian and you know there's no way i can understand that and they're not translated um and we had and like all the um videos that i had seen that were in english just something seemed so off about them you know there was just so much pomegranate molasses like why would you too little no no no no no so much there was like a cup and a half of like pomegranate and ourselves that is just diabetes in a you know in a dish i'm gonna talk to them i'm also gonna talk with my friends ben harrison and adam pranika who make a couple of star trek recap podcasts over on the maximum fun podcast network the three of us are going to recap and review movies that heavily feature food or cooking we're starting with stanley tucci's big night is the food safety rating of this restaurant just a mr yuck face outside given given where given shaloob's hairy arms and where the the staff sleeps at night and that's the thing that doesn't work you can't open a restaurant you're not counting on the naturally anti-microbial properties of wooden cutting boards which my audience loves to remind me about because hey is this seasoning the cutting board goose you just season it with an employee oh god you bring it here you bring it to my home my home in my bedroom where my wife sleeps yeah i didn't i didn't catch which of the two omelette plates you put the vinegar on though was it the one on the right or on the left i love those two boys they're the best the cool thing about food is that it connects directly with nearly every other aspect of life so i'm hoping that the podcast can be a place where we talk about things a little farther afield of what we normally discuss in the videos i think that we'll find more room here on the pod to talk about music and movies and art and youtubing and life and family and relationships and work and health and fitness and that's why we started this whole thing with a bodybuilding metaphor about chickens or was it a chicken metaphor about bodybuilding in any case yes chickens do not have skinny legs the drumstick the bone with the giant lump of dark meat at one end that lump is the chicken's calf muzzle the drumstick is the shin or lower leg of the chicken and it has yates level calves the skinny little sticks you see chickens walking around on are not its legs but its feet chickens like most birds are digit-grade animals meaning they walk on their toes not on their feet our feet our human feet are parallel to the ground and they kind of roll across the ground as we walk making us plantagrade animals chicken feet are perpendicular to the ground and they hang out in the air like a pair of very skinny legs which they are not so the next time a gym bro says that you have chicken legs say thank you as i shall thank you for hitting subscribe wherever you have found this recording there

Most of the botanical...",2022-11-24 14:47:05.183328, late winter in the grassy parts of the world you will very often see tufts of green bursting up way ahead of all the other turf around them little green explosions of early spring and they taste like onions though i think those are technically garlic doesn't matter the point is there are wild alliums all around me three onions free garlic all around us right now and it's all edible assuming that it hasn't been drenched in some noxious yard care chemicals or something it's all edible and these wild plants in my grass are particularly useful this dreary time of the year when all of my herbs are either still frost bitten or just barely starting to grow green again i'll be inside cooking something sweet potato home fries in this case parboil drain then saute until crispy it'd be nice to have a bright hit of green on that plate so i walk outside i tear off a tuft and there unlimited free chives i mean these ones are not technically chives i don't think though chives do grow wild as well and regardless the small or immature greenery of any wild allium can be used just like chives these wild ones are a little tougher a little more fibrous than chives from the grocery store so i make a point to slice them extra thin that takes care of it delicious fresh oniony garlicky flavor and super pretty too one reason these wild alliums come up ahead of everything else this time of year is that a lot of them or most of them grow from bulbs just like this amaryllis that's about to bloom again amaryllis is actually related to alliums and you can see that it's about to bloom again it's growing from a bulb also related to alliums are daffodils plants like these that grow from underground bulbs are harbingers of spring because the bulb is full of last year's sunshine it's an energy store filled with carbs the plant can use to get a head start on the next growing season wait you're telling me these little blades of onion grass have tiny little subterranean bulbs on them like the bulb of an onion or garlic yes that's exactly what i'm telling you most of them though probably not as big find an older more established specimen grab it securely near the ground and pull slowly but firmly so nothing snaps check it there's the bulb smaller than a modern domestic variety but still totally edible and quite tasty actually i think it's a bit stronger and more peppery than domestic onions and garlic maybe not great for eating raw but those pungent sulfuric compounds at least tell me that i am actually eating some kind of edible allium and not a deadly poisonous plant that just happens to look like an edible allium wild alliums can look almost identical to a number of plant species known commonly as death camus and they are as bad as they sound here's one of the few case reports i was able to find where somebody got sick eating what they mistook for a wild allium 50 year old navajo guy in northeast arizona went for a walk in the woods with his daughters and dug up what he thought was a wild onion turns out it was ziggedinus paniculatus a member of the lily family known as foothill death campus it's filled with toxic alkaloids and as such it tastes extremely bitter the daughters both tasted it and then spit it out because it was extremely bitter because evolution works we generally don't like the taste of things that are acutely toxic to us but the dad swallowed half of it before he realized that it was not an onion and he got real sick within hours like violent vomiting ataxia which is loss of muscle control parasthesis which is pins and needles running up and down his arms he literally stumbled into the emergency room with scary low blood pressure they gave him iv fluids and had him swallow activated charcoal and luckily he was able to go home the next day his family found the plant and sent it to the university of arizona at tucson and yeah it was foothill death canvas which poisons grazing animals all the time if they're poorly fed and desperate enough to eat something super bitter that arizona dad got off relatively easy so the lesson here is smell the plant before you eat it tear it open unleash those enzymatic processes that make those pungent sulfur compounds that we know and love from onions and garlic smell it only onions and garlic smell like onions and garlic nothing else does the death kinda smells and tastes nothing like this another lesson here especially if you're a dad or a mom is maybe buy some life insurance which you can do with the sponsor of this video policy genius my wife and kids would be in serious financial trouble if i got hit by a bus or ate a poison plant right now my labor pays the bills around here and i have dragged my feet getting life insurance because the process can be really complicated and daunting not so at policygenius.com slash adam regucia i just put in some basic info and tell them what i want i just want term life insurance which is the cheapest i just want to make sure that if i bite it in the next 20 years my kids will have enough cash to get them grown up and through school in minutes you can compare personalized quotes from top companies to find the lowest price and coverage you need you could save 50 percent or more on life insurance by comparing quotes with policy genius they have licensed experts who work for me not the insurance companies and when i'm ready to apply they handle all the paperwork and the scheduling for free hit my link in the description policygenius.com adam ragusia get your free life insurance quotes to find out how much you could save thank you policy genius anyway yeah make sure you smell it before you eat it make sure that it smells like onions or garlic is this onions or garlic well when the plants are this small i don't think that distinction is particularly meaningful or important it's hard to conclusively id them until they grow big enough to flower but these i believe are allium veneel which is known as wild garlic or onion grass or field garlic crow garlic it tastes kind of garlicky but you're not going to be peeling any individual cloves with papery skins so whether it's onions or garlic i don't think really matters allium veneel grows natively all across afro-eurasia but here in the americas it's actually invasive also in australia too apparently it doesn't really cause much of a problem in yards other than making you smell like onions when you mow the lawn but ranchers hate the stuff if cattle graze on too much field garlic those flavors show up in the milk and the meat which could be kind of awesome but i understand why some consumers might be put off also if livestock eat a ton of field garlic they can get a little sick remember those pungent sulfur compounds in alliums are a chemical weapon designed to repel animals mostly insects but allium the neo apparently has a high level of sulfides that can be a digestive irritant in farm animals and for that same reason experts advise against humans eating wild garlic in enormous quantities which you probably wouldn't do anyway there are of course many other wild allium species that are commonly foraged here are some of them and i think i have some of them growing in my lawn as well particularly i think allium canadense or however you say that it's this one over here unlike the tubular greens of the wild garlic this has flatter like u-shaped leaves but they still smell and taste like onion allium cannadense means canada onion but it's also called canadian garlic or meadow garlic because the distinction between onion and garlic doesn't really matter with plants this little and like i said the wild alliums are most useful to me as a kind of emergency last minute fresh herb like a couple of years ago i was shooting this mushroom risotto recipe and i realized that i had not gotten any kind of fresh herb to garnish it with which is really really important for the thumbnail so i just walked outside to the front yard snipped off some of whatever species that particular tuft is and boom or bam as a great man used to say when applying finishing herbs here in the american south this supply of free fresh herbs in the yard runs from gosh the second half of winter all the way until it gets really hot in the summer and the plants kind of die back but then in the fall they spring back up out of the bulbs again they grow in recognizable clumps because the bulbs underground spin off other bulbs which spin off into other bulbs etc etc if you see just one or two little fine green hairs sticking up those plants might have just recently taken root from the seeds that blew off of the flowers and into the wind from a plant that did not get mowed before it could flower but if you find a clump that looks pretty big and beefy like that one that's well established meaning it's been there probably for many seasons so the ground is full of big delicious bulbs storing energy as sugar and starch you can rip the whole clump up and fish out the individual bulbs i want to stress again that even if the plant itself is non-toxic it could be contaminated with toxic chemicals in the ground water and such so you probably want a forage in ground that you know and trust here's a really nice way to cook any small pretty vegetables not just yard garlic leave them whole or maybe cut them in half to preserve their shape throw them in just enough water to boil slash steam them i might add a little more water as i go but my goal is to have most of that water evaporated by the time the veggies are just fork tender then you turn off the heat nothing should be bubbling anymore and it's safe to melt in some butter the butter will form an emulsion with the remaining water which has concentrated onion garlic flavor in it and you just get this beautiful silky glaze on them chop up some of the greens to use for garnish and yeah those are some michelin star caliber yard onions right there they taste delicious though a little bit bitter compared to domestic alliums bitterness is one of the first traits that people breed out of vegetables when they start farming them but it's not bothering me here at all it's a nice fresh counterpoint to the sweetness of last year's sunshine stored in those little bulbs go find you some free food in the yard or the front garden brits would call it a garden,3
Fresh berry soufflé with berry sauce,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fyFppQJUUls/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLA_tXjckBqGvhj9eg2LOwtUxazimA,fyFppQJUUls,"8 minutes, 50 seconds","Thanks to Helix Sleep for sponsoring this video!

...",2022-11-24 14:47:05.183328, berry souffle with a fresh berry sauce perhaps the fanciest dessert i've ever made and not that hard as with any souffle the downside is you cannot make it in advance but you can take it up to a certain point in advance eat dinner chill for a while make the souffle and then have it with a night cap with my recipe here the berry sauce is both the garnish and the flavor and color for the souffle base so it's pretty efficient these are six ounce 170 gram boxes of berries two of them for just two portions raspberries and blueberries are a good combination and you could take a few of the prettiest ones out to reserve for garnish at the end a tablespoon of granulated sugar in there 12 grams and then i'mma get my potato masher and mash these up but you could use just about any means of destruction at your disposal fresh raspberries are super delicate so this probably isn't even necessary for them but the blueberries have stronger skins they need a little help popping open i will say you might want a little more sauce than this recipe makes i'm just trying to be efficient because fresh berries are expensive but you could totally throw an extra box of whatever berries you want in here and another big pinch of sugar it'd be fine so my heat is on medium and now i need to stir it pretty constantly to keep anything on the bottom from burning and help everything just break down i'm looking to see the plant tissues in there fall apart you'll see the sauce loosen up a bit at first as more juice gets released and the color will deepen lots of color cooking out of the blueberry skins i think i simmered that for about five minutes and it's okay if it seems like there's still good stuff locked in the solids because now we take a bowl and a sieve dump everything in and grind with a wooden spoon push and scrape in circles until you have just a ball of seeds and skin left make sure you scrape off the sauce clinging to the underside and now you should have about a cup of a sauce that tastes like artisanal pop-tarts give that saucepan a rinse just to get out any chunks get two eggs and a bowl big enough to whip them in crack them into said bowl and now i'll separate out the yolks these eggs are real fresh so this is going to be a two-hand job the yolks are clinging to the whites yolks go into the saucepan which should have cooled down by now with the yolks we'll have another two tablespoons of granulated sugar 24 grams grab a whisk and mix those up you'll definitely want a real whisk for this recipe not a fork or anything then my starch will be two tablespoons of corn starch 16 grams you can make souffle with a butter and flour roux but the cornstarch gets you a lighter more marshmallowy consistency that i want here there's not enough liquid in the pan to disperse all that starch so i'm gonna grab about two thirds of my sauce two thirds of a cup like 160 mils and gradually drizzle that in as i whisk it's just important to get all the starch granules dispersed in a thick slurry before you add in too much liquid if there's too much water all at once the starch will clump up that's pretty smooth and the last thing i'll put in there will be a tablespoon of butter 14 grams heat on low the classical way of cooking a souffle base is to cook your butter and flour roux bring the liquid up to a simmer and whisk that gradually into the eggs and the sugar preferably over a double boiler with this recipe i've found it's pretty safe to just put everything into a cold pan and heat it directly over low flame as long as you whisk non-stop and you don't take your eye off it if you stop whisking and or if you heat it up too fast you risk getting scrambled eggs if you get the butter melted in and you've been whisking for a couple of minutes and nothing is happening you might need to up the heat a little bit but be careful slow and steady wins this race after five minutes of whisking all of a sudden there's my egg proteins coagulating you can see it gotta keep whisking so they don't clump up in curds a minute after that there's my cornstarch gelatinizing that happens at a higher temperature and you have to wait for it luckily it's easy to see and now we're done get that off the heat let it cool everything thus far can be done well in advance when you're ready to bake it's time to beat the egg whites until they are as fluffy as my hybrid foam and spraying mattress from the sponsor of this video helix sleep i'm so confident in this mattress that i'm going to drop my very expensive camera straight onto it from ceiling height the camera's okay and so is my back which used to be in a fair bit of stress on our old mattress i sleep far more comfortably here despite the fact that this mattress shipped to

sleep mattress plus two free pillows they're the best pillows thank you helix sleep so with my egg yolks i'll put in a tiny pinch of cream of tartar but you could use a few drops of lemon juice or something that'll stabilize the foam as will a little pinch of salt and the dessert needs a little salt anyway beat that until you get the egg whites pretty stiff and when they start to look glossy and leave trails like that now for about 40 grams of sugar you could use granulated sugar but powdered sugar gets you a finer texture and a much smoother prettier top on the souffle that's a third of a cup of powdered sugar and i'm beating it into the egg whites in two batches because it's a lot of sugar and too much at once could collapse the foam now just beat this on full blast until you have pretty stiff peaks like those last thing just a little splash of vanilla too much will mess with the purple color a couple ramekins would be the standard baking vessels but i'm gonna use a couple of tea cups because they're prettier and they have handles melt just a little bit of butter and then lightly grease the insides classically trained chefs always talk about how you must use vertical strokes on a souffle mold and i'm always like well how else could you physically do it with a brush now we take a little bit of this meringue and just whisk that mercilessly into the cooled souffle base we're gonna collapse that bit of foam it doesn't matter we just need to lighten up the base a bit so that we can more easily fold it into the rest of the meringue the classical way of doing this really works cut and fold cut and fold nice and gently trying to get to a homogeneous mix in as few moves as possible we don't want to deflate the foam too much though honestly souffles are so light that you really can't afford to lose a fair bit of air here the thing is still going to rise glossy and gorgeous that is time to pack in the batter all the way to the brim and push it down to make sure you don't have any big air pockets that could throw off the cooking all the way to the top and then smooth it off these are standard teacups about 200 mils i tried doing a bigger portion in a tall coffee cup and i could never get the center cooked enough the dimensions just weren't right here's another classical trick that really works take your thumb and scoop a little lip out of the top right around the rim i've tested this it's worth it it keeps the souffles little muffin top from drooping over the sides as it expands how many of us know about that problem in our own lives last thing i'm gonna take a damp paper towel and clean these cups a bit because the baking dish is the serving dish my oven is at 375 fahrenheit 190c not convection obviously google your teacups to find out if they're oven safe but if they're normal stoneware they probably are that glaze fired in a 2000 degree kiln it's gonna be fine in that oven for like 20 minutes while you're waiting you can clean up and pour the remaining third of a cup of sauce into an attractive little serving spout if you have one that sauce is maybe a hair tart and under sweet on its own but on the souffle it'll be the perfect counterpoint i've been baking about 18 minutes and things are looking pretty gorgeous when the tops are just a little golden brown the inside is generally perfect those need another minute or two but i like to pull these when they're still pretty wobbly which you can assess by just tapping the cup a bit i think souffles should be a little gooey inside if it's solid it's just a sponge cake souffle start to deflate or fall the instant you take them out of the oven and the steam subsides so the trick is to eat them right when they're just cool enough to not burn you i'll let these sit until i can touch their handles you could spank on a little powdered sugar if you want maybe put a few of those reserved berries on top and then a pretty common way to apply sauce is to dig a little hole in the center see inflated but still gooey then pour your sauce into that little crater kind of like filling a jelly donut in addition to tasting absolutely delicious the sauce helps visually as gorgeous as souffles look on the outside they always look disgusting inside and the sauce kinda covers that up you can see how the edge pulls away from the cup because we buttered the inside i am really happy with this recipe that is sexy food a perfect date night situation and again not that hard though i would recommend trying it at least once before the big night if you've never done a souffle before that is just fruity velvet on a cloud,3

Brian Lagerstrom's...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.183328," Young people often ask me what they should
make for a big family function, and I tell them, ""Some kind of beef stew, like beef bourguignon,
with mashed potatoes."" Why? Because both things are easy and cheap to make in huge quantities,
you can do all the work way ahead of time, and both finished dishes can just sit around
for hours until people are ready to eat and nothing will degrade in quality. It doesn't
matter if somebody is late, you don't have to rush people to the table at just the right
minute. People can eat whenever they want, they can serve themselves, and everybody loves
it — at least everybody who eats beef. This particular recipe does a few unorthodox
things designed to make your life even easier if you are cooking for a big occasion. And
I think the result tastes way more difficult and expensive than it is. Start on either
the day before or the morning of your feast. First thing, I'll put a big, deep roasting
pan in my oven and turn on the broiler/grill — the top element. If you don't have a broiler,
just turn your oven on full blast and let the pan get real hot while you cut up your
meat. If you can get it, may favorite beef stew
cut is boneless short rib. This must be a byproduct of some other cut my grocery store
does because they're not very expensive and it braises better than any other cut I know.
Tons of fat marbling, tons of flavor. I won't cut those up at all — those are perfect-sized
chunks as it. But considerably cheaper and far more common
is a big, thick beef chuck roast. Shoulder meat — the classic beef stew cut. For an easy stew, I think you want to start
by trimming out the inter-muscular fat — the thick bands of solid white fat running between
the four or five distinct muscles that make up this cut. I just try to follow the fat
with my knife, separate those different muscles, trimming out the fat as I go. Sometimes you
can literally just pull the muscles apart along the seam and then you just shave off
the fat and gristle on either side. If you take a little time now to trim out
the big fat hunks, the pieces themselves will be more palatable and you won't have to skim
fat off the sauce later. It's easier to get it out now. The intramuscular fat, we want
to keep — the fine white flecks inside the muscles. That's delicious and it won't all
melt out into the sauce. As you can see, I'm cutting this into huge chunks. I want big,
hearty chunks in the end — the meat will shrink in half, at least, over the course
of the cooking. Post-trimming, I've got about four pounds
of meat there — a little less than two kilos. That should feed at least eight people, with
all the vegetables and potatoes. And I will season it with salt and pepper and then coat
the pieces lightly in oil. According to my experiments it makes no difference whether
you season the meat now or season the braising liquid later. The meat will absorb the salt
no matter what over the hours in which it is braising. However, this is going to be a huge stew and
I have trouble eyeballing my seasoning with quantities that big. Therefore, I am simply
using the raw, dry beef chunks as a visual guide. It's just gonna help me eyeball how
much seasoning I need. When it doubt, be conservative, because we can always add more to the sauce
at the end when we can taste it. At the oven, my roasting pan is rocket hot
and I will simply dump in my meat. It should sizzle on contact, and I will try to spread
the chunks into an even layer. The oil will help it brown from the bottom and from the
top under the heat of the broiler. In my tests, the broiler has done a better
job of browning meat quickly than your normal roasting or baking settings. I don't think
any oven setting browns meat as well as you can by frying it off on the stovetop. But
if we do it in the oven we can do it all in one batch, the splatter and the smell is more
contained, and we only have to heat up one appliance, not two. Plus we're gonna brown
this some more at the very end — you'll see. Here we are after 10 minutes, and I don't
want to take much longer browning these. If I give these high heat for too long, the inside
of the meat will cook and go gray. I want it to stay pink to the end. So now, for flavor
and thickening, I'm stirring in enough flour to coat all the meat. It ended up being about
half a cup of flour. Mixed with the rendered fat in there, this is a crude but effective
way of making a roux. And for flavor I need to let that flour brown a bit, so back the
pan goes under the broiler. Five minutes later I can see and smell that
flour browning. So I'll reach in and squeeze on some tomato paste. I want that to brown
a little too, for flavor and color. But it tends to burn real fast, so three minutes
later, I'm calling that good enough. At this point I can turn my broiler off. I'm done
with it. I'm not calling this beef bourguignon because
I don't want any trouble with the people who gate-keep that term, but I am using red wine,
about a third of the way up the side of the meat. I'll braise beef in straight white wine,
but I think red wine tends to be too strong and bitter in the end if you don't cut it
with water or stock. Water or stock until there's liquid coming two-thirds of the way
up the side of the meat. By the time the beef and vegetables release their water, we'll
have just enough liquid in there for a thick stew. I think this is optional, but any source of
concentrated umami could give you a boost. I'm throwing in some Worcestershire but you
could use some soy sauce or even fish sauce, MSG, a handful of dried mushrooms, whatever.
You could also just throw in a stock cube or two. Don't forget these are very salty,
but by the time we add in our vegetables it shouldn't be too much salt. I'll just stir all that up. I think the quantity
of meat you cook with this recipe is determined by the size of your roasting pan. You can
cook as many very large chunks as you can get to lie in a single layer in your pan.
This is a 9x13-inch pan, 23-33 cm, but you could do even more beef with a bigger pan.
I will cover it in foil, tightly, to trap steam, and in it goes to the oven at 275ºF/135ºC.
According my experiments, that is the highest temperature you can use while still being
sure your that meat will be very pink inside at the end. You can simply forget about this now for at
least four hours. It will need no babysitting. Between the low temperature and the foil,
hardly any water will evaporate and that will keep the meat as safe as I am on the internet

It's a tiny expense for what you get. Link and code in the description. Thank you, Surfshark. Oh hey, this is very optional, but as soon
as I've got my beef braising I'll grab a whole head of garlic and slice off the tippy top
of each clove — I want to open up a little escape hatch for each clove. Then I'll coat
this in oil, wrap it in foil and throw it in the oven to slow-roast. That's gonna be
for my potatoes, and at such low temperature it should take as long as the beef takes. While my beef is braising I can prep my vegetables
at a leisurely pace. I've got a pound of carrots. I like to peel them but you don't have to.
And one advantage of not peeling them is that if they get overcooked, the peel kinda holds
the piece together. So there's pros and cons either way. But I'd suggest big hearty pieces
because they look cool, especially when you cut them at an angle, plus big pieces are
less likely to go mushy. I'ma do a couple stalks of celery today. Celery
is controversial in my house but I love it, and it's particularly good for the flavor
that it contributes to the sauce. If you want that flavor without the chunks of celery,
just use some celery seed. I've also got a handful of garlic here that I will smash and
peel. Lately I've been putting smashed whole cloves into my stews. They're super sweet
by the time you're done cooking them and they're good to eat whole. Alright, my beef has been in for four hours
and it's almost as soft as I want it. I can poke it easily with a fork. Now is a very
safe time to put in the vegetables. There's really no danger that I'll reach a point where
my vegetables are tender but the meat still needs way more time. You could throw in any kind of onion but today
I'm reaching for a frozen bag of pre-peeled pearl onions. These are classic in beef stew
for a reason. They hold their shape and make delicious little juicy morsels when coated
in sauce. No need to thaw them first. I'm just gently patting those in because I don't
want to risk breaking up my beef chunks. And if it seems like now there isn't enough liquid
in here, that is good, because tons of water is gonna come pouring out of this veg as it
cooks. I'll just cover that up, and throw it back in for an hour or two until the veg
is tender as I want it. Meanwhile I can do my potatoes. I've got about
five pounds of potatoes, a little bit more than two kilos. And for mash I often like
a mixture of waxy potatoes and mealy/floury potatoes. More often they're called baking
potatoes here in the States, and their skins are disgusting when boiled — like wet paper
bag. I will definitely peel these before cutting into big chunks for even and rapid cooking.
These red, waxy potatoes I will not peel. Their skins are much thinner — the texture
is unobtrusive in the mash and I think they make it look real pretty. In that goes to a big pot, cover with water,
bring to a boil and cook until you can very easily pierce the pieces with a fork. It's
also a good sign if you see the skins starting to peel off by themselves. These took 20 minutes,
and I'll just drain them through the pot lid. Colanders take up way too much space in the
dishwasher. You could just hold these as-is for awhile,
or finish up the mash now by throwing in just enough butter to make you feel shame. Yes,
that's a whole pound, 454g, but you could use less. And I'll throw in a little splash
of milk to start with. I can always add more but I can't take it out. Same deal with the
salt — just one big pinch for now, especially considering that's salted butter I've got
in there. A bunch of pepper, and I'll just cover this for a sec while the butter melts
in the residual heat. My burner is off. Now you could mash this however you like.
Personally I like whipped potatoes and this is an especially easy method when you're making
a very large quantity of potatoes. Give that a taste. Needs more salt. And here
is my head of garlic that's been slow-roasting in the oven all day. Since I snipped off the
tops of the cloves, I can just squeeze this like toothpaste in there and now I've got
this insanely strong, sweet flavor permeating my mash. Optional but very nice. If you want
your mash to be thinner, loosen it up with a little more milk. Keep in mind it'll be
a little stiffer when it cools to eating temperature. And now that's done. Personally I prefer egg
noodles with beef stew, but cooked noodles get mushy if they sit around for too long.
That mash will remain perfect all day. Just turn the burner on low underneath it to warm
it up. Ok, I'm going to use an additional thickener
in my beef stew and that will be unflavored gelatin. This replicates the sticky, glossy
sauce texture they get in a French restaurant by using demi-glacé, which is traditionally
made by simmering roasted veal bones all day. This stuff is made from lord-knows-what animals,
maybe pigs. If that bothers you, look for kosher or halal gelatin. I've got two quarter-ounce
packets in there, 14g. And I will bloom those in just enough cold water to get it dissolved. You can skip this step. I often just scatter
gelatin right into hot sauce. It'll clump in hot liquid, and you can stir the clumps
until they dissolve. But my beef is so soft, I do not want to risk breaking it up as I
stir in my gelatin, hence why I bloomed it first. This now will not clump and will require
hardly any stirring. My stew has been cooking for about six hours
total. I can taste my veg and it's perfectly tender to my liking, but if you want it softer,
cook it some more. I'll taste the sauce, because this is my last chance to make any adjustments.
I will never stir this again. A ton of pepper, some more salt. Remember the sauce needs to
be salty enough to season all these vegetables, so I want the sauce a little too salty on
its own. I think it could use some brightening and maybe some sweetening — both can be
provided by a little balsamic vinegar. If you don't want to use any wine at all, just
use water or stock and maybe double this amount of balsamic at the end. You'll get a similar
effect. Balsamic is basically wine concentrate, as far as cooking is concerned. Lastly I'll just deposit my bloomed gelatin
in dollops so that I don't have to stir it very much to get it evenly distributed. The
beef chunks are jelly-soft at this point, which is delicious, but if you smash them
around they're gonna shred into string. So rather than stirring, I'm kinda folding or
turning this. I find a big spatula is the best tool for sliding under the pieces and
gently turning them over. Just get the gelatin and all the veg and everything evenly worked
through the sauce. You might ask why not put the gelatin in at
the beginning? Well, because gelatin breaks down in heat over time. A few minutes of boiling
does not matter, but a whole day of cooking could make a difference. It might loose some
of its thickening power. And because we were conservative about the
amount of liquid we introduced in here, we do not have to fish all the beef out so we
can reduce down the sauce. It's already reduced and concentrated. And since we trimmed the
fat out of the meat at the beginning, we don't have to skim grease off of this sauce or run
it through a gravy separator. Though you could now throw this in the refrigerator until tomorrow,
just to hold it. And then you could pick off any solid bits of cold fat that settle on
the top. Regardless, whenever you're about ready to
eat, you can do the final step, which is to turn the broiler back on — that top element.
This will reheat the stew and brown the top. This gets you outrageous flavor and a nice
crispy texture on some of the meat and veg surface that will contrast beautifully with
the soft texture of everything that's below the waterline — heterogeneity! Keep an eye on it so nothing burns — I took
mine out after about 15 minutes. Let it cook to eating temperature and the sauce will thicken
up even more. Hey, that's a two-pan dinner. If either dish gets too cold before you actually
eat, just turn the burners on low underneath them. It'll be like a chaffing dish on a buffet
line. You could serve this buffet style. People can just spoon on some mash, take whatever
chunks they like. If they hate celery, they can leave it behind. Make sure to give them
a serving spoon that is not slotted, so they can spoon over some extra sauce. And I'd give
them some fresh herbs to scatter on. Any herbs could work but I'm reaching for the leaves
from the celery I used — it's one of my favorite finishing herbs. And there you go. It's a day of work, but
it's easy work. Most of the cooking is totally passive. You've got a ton of very fancy food
for very little money, and very little stress because serving this is not time sensitive.
You're not hustling people to the table, being like, ""You must eat NOW before the crepes
go mushy (or whatever) and then you won't be IMPRESSED by me,"" because everybody knows
that's the real goal, not — like — making other people happy, or something. If you want a stew that's a little fancier
and more chefy, might I suggest the beef bourguignon recipe recently posted by Brian Lagerstrom.
It's linked in the description. I don't usually watch other food YouTubers because it just
psychs me out, but I watch Brian sometimes and his bourguignon recipe inspired me to
come up with this stew. I wanted to see if I could make something similar but even easier.
His stew is pretty easy too. Make his or mine and treat you friends and family to the kind
of feast they actually want.",3

what temperature in the oven should you marinate the meat beforehand should you season the meat before you brown it off and what's the best thickener these are questions i have puzzled my entire adult life because i'm just that kind of gluttonous dork and i decided it was time to finally a b test all of these questions to my own satisfaction if you'd like to watch then come along for all these tests i'm using the same exact mixture of celery carrots garlic and onions the meat is beef shoulder cut into huge chunks you gotta remember they're gonna shrink at least by half so if you want thick boys start double thick here first is my baseline recipe for the coming comparisons this is my reference stew unseasoned meat goes into the hot oil brown that off pull it out veg goes in the same pot get some color on that and get it softening a squeeze of tomato paste brown that for a second meat back in red wine a third of the way up water another third of the way up enough salt and pepper for the whole pot stir that around cover and simmer like half a day until the meat is jelly unsurprisingly delicious a classic for a reason first test marinades i've been known to defend the honor of marinades against skeptics before but i've always been skeptical of this marinade lots of time-tested beef berganyon recipes tell you to soak the raw meat with the mirepoix in red wine for a day or two which i did afterward it got a very dramatic purple stain on it now the recipes generally tell you to strain dry off the meat so you can sear it and i'm getting some very different and very nice smells guessing those aromas are from wine compounds trapped in the surface of the meat normally they can't brown because they're surrounded by water from the wine i will say though i'm having a real hard time judging how much i've browned these they're all stained black are they done let's go with yes then you throw in your strained veg and do everything the same as before using the wine from the marinade water seasoning simmer until soft and that tastes exactly the damn same as the reference recipe no difference in flavor whatsoever that i can detect the browning of the wine which sounds like a bible story but anyway the browning of the wine and any different flavors that that created just did not come through in the final dish and the individual beef pieces are no more deeply flavored than the non-marinated pieces this is no surprise at all to me the meat cooks in the wine all damn day that is plenty of time for flavor exchange and penetration and all of that the marinating is just redundant marinades are really good at fixing flavor into the surface of meats that you then dry off and then grill really quick or something like that in this context i don't think marinades do anything for you and i actually think the marinade hurts the texture there's enough acid in wine to denature meat proteins during a super long marinade and the result is this mealy mushy texture that always reminds me of cat food or at least my impressions of what cat food must taste like based on cat food commercials here's my hypothesis as to why french farmers wives used to marinate their buff like this back in yeolden days maybe it helped preserve the raw meat for a few days until they were actually ready to cook it kind of a short-term pickle and or the resulting chemical tenderization allowed them to cook the meat to an edible softness in much less time and if you do it in less time that saves on fuel your typical western european peasant generally did not have giant roaring fires all the time they cut down all their trees in europe firewood was really expensive chemical tenderization may yield gross texture but at least it gets you meat that you can gum down with your horrible pre-modern peasant teeth nowadays we can tenderize with long slow cooking and those results are far more delicious in my opinion my conclusion is there is zero reason to marinate my beef burgundy on in fact there's less than zero reason to do it next up let's test seasoning should you season the stew meat before you brown it or can you just season the braising liquid you know testing my meat reminds me that i recently tested my testosterone with the sponsor of this video let's get checked want to see how my beef stacks up i'll show you in a sec in all seriousness here's why i am enthusiastic to work with a home medical testing company like let's get checked this is not part of the ad this is just something that i've been wanting to say to you so recently i wanted to get a simple test done i went to the doctor the doctor sent me to a specialist and the specialist sent me to a lab that actually did the test there were months of waiting in between each of those appointments and then when i finally got it done no one could tell me how much any of this was going to cost you just have to wait until the insurance company tells you something it's like a fun reverse lottery you have no idea what's going to happen or how much is going to be expected of you anyway i finally got the test done i finally got the results and i am still getting bills from that experience random bills in the mail i have no idea if they're right or not sometimes they're from entities i don't even recognize and the bill that was the biggest went to the specialist who literally did nothing dude literally just said okay we'll go to this lab that was it but that's just how things tend to go in our trash can health care system here in the united states i should have just ordered my own test online and now the ad you can go to letsgetcheck.com and order a sexual health test or all kinds of basic tests like i said i was curious about my hormone levels now that i'm old man ragusa the pricing is reasonable and totally transparent no surprises they send you a foolproof kit i basically just pressed a button to get the blood that i needed you drop your sample in the mail and your results are available at your secure online account within days all results are reviewed by a doctor and if you've got a real problem a nurse will contact you for a phone call all the labs are accredited these are real doctors and nurses let's get checked as legit and again they're not paying me to say this part i just want to make it clear that adam believes in science and in doctors i also believe in my right to gather information about my own body without getting a mother may i from the aforementioned trashcan healthcare system indeed my hormone levels are normal for a dude my age but there's a few things going in the wrong direction compared to my last test so i'm gonna show these results to my doctor and see what she thinks get yourself checked hit my link in the description and use my code adam30 for 30 off any test you want adam30 for 30 off use the link in the description thank you let's get checked now back to our tests this meat i will season with salt and pepper before searing off and then stewing this meat i will not season directly i will season my wine and not my meat put that in your meme and smoke it simmer both until they're soft and here they are side by side is there any difference at all in the final braise absolutely none that i can perceive this is also not surprising to me at all half a day is plenty of time for everything in that pot to come to some kind of equilibrium in terms of saltiness any seasoning you sear into the surface is just going to dissolve into the wine and then over the time you braise it it's just going to diffuse back into the meat just like it would if you'd seasoned the wine where there's no real difference in result i figured just do whichever is convenient for you and indeed it may be more convenient to braise the meat in the oven instead of on the stovetop but does it taste better some people say it does this stew i braised at 350 fahrenheit 180c and it was done like an hour sooner than the reference stew i did on the stovetop it smells amazing look at all that surface browning you get in the oven even with the lid on but the meat is a little overcooked inside to my taste it's more gray than it is pink people always ask me why i don't use pressure cookers and here's one of the main reasons if you braise beef really really low and slow eventually it'll be just butter soft but still pink on the inside it won't happen with a pressure cooker a pressure cooker works faster because it's able to achieve much higher temperatures and so you're able to get soft meat but it's gray on the inside and so is this meat comparatively it also doesn't taste quite as great as it smells let's try that again at lower temperature 250 fahrenheit 120 c that took way longer about eight hours to get the tenderness that i want there's no surface browning so it doesn't have those amazing smells but lordy that tastes way way better and the meat is pink on the inside and 250 fahrenheit is such a low oven temperature that i didn't have to babysit that stew at all i never had to check it to see if it was evaporating off too much water it basically didn't evaporate anything at all the one that i cooked at a higher temperature i had to top that off with water a couple of times to keep it from burning and i want to emphasize the stew i baked at 250 tasted way better i ended up eating that entire sample for science the lower temperature just seemed to preserve a lot of the flavor it didn't all evaporate off in the form of delicious smells and the brightness of the wine was preserved and if we wanted that awesome surface browning we could just flip on the broiler slash grill at the last minute right of course with that kind of lower temperature cooking you get less evaporation and therefore less thickening really all of these stews could use some thickening and the most obvious thing to reach for is starch i'll make a quick roux of equal parts oil and flour let that brown for a few minutes i would normally do this at the beginning of the stew making process not at the end but in goes some of my braising liquid make sure it comes to a boil to gelatinize the starch and let's taste that on some meat very tasty but it's got that gloopy gravy consistency that i associate with unpretentious home cooking sometimes i like to be pretentious if you hadn't already noticed and to that end i've been experimenting a lot lately with unflavored gelatin as a thickener basically this replicates the demi-gloss they'd use in a fancy french restaurant or at least it gets you the texture of that whether you simmer it out of roasted veal bones or you shake it out of a brown packet it's all the same protein gelatin is gelatin and that gets you a much sexier glossy look with a smooth and sticky mouth feel i just love i love them both roux on the left gelatin on the right who says we have to choose combine the two i'm sure they use both flour and demi in our restaurant beef bergenion and indeed that's just awesome so that's what i learned in my little tests here i have attempted to assimilate all of that knowledge into a new beef stew recipe that i'm really really happy with gets you a lot of bang for buck both in terms of literal money and in time and effort i will show you that recipe next time,3

like approaches to each of these very basic delights if you know nothing about how to cook an egg in a pan i have endeavored to make a video for you and this is it first thing you'll need is a pan and the main reason i keep one non-stick pan around is for eggs yes people had fried eggs prior to the invention of teflon in 1938 but it's just way harder to do in other kinds of pans save that for the 201 class in a good non-stick pan you could use no fat at all but i think most people use some anyway because it makes the egg taste better and eggs can still stick in here without some grease i think butter tastes better than oil plus butter gives you lots of sensory clues about how hot your pan is if the butter just kind of melts and looks smooth like that your pan is not hot enough yet unless you're going for a very soft pure white egg if it foams gently that's a great starting temperature for eggs if the butter browns your pan is pretty hot for eggs which is good for some things and not for others i think a gentle foaming is a good place to start and on my stove that's just south of medium but every stove is different in my experience you can cook eggs straight out of the refrigerator or you can cook them at room temperature it really doesn't make much of a difference first step is to crack it which takes some practice if you hit it too hard well that happens obviously if you don't hit it hard enough you have to really dig in with your thumbs to break it the rest of the way and when you do that you risk sending a shard up inside the egg that breaks the yolk the yolk is like a water balloon in there and just because it didn't happen that time doesn't mean it can't happen i think that same risk is why it's bad to crack on the side of a bowl or some such you're just sending spiky bits of shell up inside the egg where they could stab the yolk a bowl also just tends to make lots of little shards that are hard to fish out better to crack on a flat surface and in she goes you can see that this egg is not terribly fresh nor is it terribly old see how there's a little plateau of elevated white circling the yoke that's the white that was attached to the upward facing side of the yoke when it was inside the shell and it's still attached it's just slumping over the sides like long hair over your head if this egg was really old the white would have broken down to the point where you would not see that plateau the white would be super liquid and sitting really flat and this is a little liquid you can see where it's running out in little messy offshoots a really fresh egg doesn't do that the white is viscous enough that it holds a really tidy shape in the pan it doesn't spill out every which way you can see that the bottom layer of white is very well cooked at this point it's got a slightly golden edge around it it's firm enough that i can slide this egg around and it holds together that inner ring of white is still kind of gooey not quite set yet and that yolk is still cold one of the great things about cooking eggs is you can just touch them to assess them that yolk is not just raw it's literally still cold from the refrigerator if you cook a sunny side up egg like this you're going to get a white that is so firm you can't really cut it with a fork and or you're going to get a totally raw yolk on top some people like that i kind of like that but say you want it a little more evenly cooked through butter in a nice gentle foam crack in the egg oh by the way this is when a lot of people would sprinkle on a tiny pinch of salt when that top is still liquid enough to dissolve the grains a little bit that way you get more even seasoning on top if you're into that i usually just salt my eggs at the table anyway to get the egg to cook evenly now you slap on your lid your lid okay so i don't have a lid for this pan and if i really like sunny side up eggs i would buy a lid for this pan because a tight-fitting lid is much better at this than a piece of foil but the foil will do it just traps some steam in there that cooks the top of the egg and you can tell because after a few minutes the yolk gets kind of cloudy if i touch it it's warm but still very soft and runny which is how i almost always want it but if you want it firmer just keep cooking it until you can feel that it's firmer time to slide that baby out in most cases i think it's easier to slide the egg right out of the pan onto the plate it can be tricky to get a spatula up under there as you will soon see so now we've got a somewhat more evenly cooked egg though the bottom layer is still so heavily cooked that it's a little brown and it's hard to cut with just a fork i like that but lots of people don't if you want an egg that's really soft and creamy and pure white on the bottom you need really low heat the butter is hardly foaming at all that means the pan isn't even hot enough to evaporate the water out of the butter in the egg goes and the bottom layer of white is setting but it's not fluttering around there's no steam making it bubble and dance around the edges that's what we want for these purposes no fluttering cover so the top will steam and this is going to take a while with such low heat that was about 8 minutes but the result is a really soft custardy white that you can easily cut with a fork the yolk is warm but still very runny very nice you could go in the exact opposite direction and do a crispy egg i think oil is better for this the milk solids and butter would likely burn at the temperatures we're going to use i'm on medium heat now but as soon as i crack that in i can see i need to go higher for a crispy egg i want to see that skirt of white fluttering in the breeze lots of steam making the white bubble and dance around and stand back because steam bubbles are going to explode and this is going to start spitting hot oil at you there's a reason i've got the camera up on a tripod for this one instead of sitting down on the counter i love a crispy egg but they are legit dangerous to make don't let any kids around the stove when this is happening once the egg's about done you can turn the heat down and safely inspect close up i can see the yolk is looking a little cloudy even though i never covered it that's just because the heat in the pan was way higher it reached up to the yolk if anything that yolk is overdone to my taste to assess the bottom you just lift it up it's so firm and crispy it's like a potato chip of egg since there's excess oil in the pan i will lift this out with a spatula so i can leave that grease behind you know early in my youtube career a dude in the comments scolded me for getting a little golden brown on my eggs he tried to argue that browning on eggs is objectively bad it's not something that anyone with good taste would ever want and i was like dude tell that to asia that is super tasty but here's probably my favorite way to do an egg with a nice bright solid yolk on top a basted egg put a little more oil in the pan than you would normally use yeah you can do this with butter but i like to do it with extra virgin olive oil or one time i did with chicken fat which was awesome cook the egg as aggressively as you want as you can see i've got no fluttering around the edges i'm going for a soft white bottom and then instead of covering the pan to steam the top you just spoon hot oil over the top it helps if you tilt the pan to make the oil pool up at one side one time i did this on the internet and a dude in the comments was like you clearly have no idea what you're doing you're using a metal utensil on a non-stick surface dude it's not like i'm grinding a knife edge into the pan it's just the round belly of a spoon that's not gonna hurt anything plus this isn't just any nonstick pan it's from the sponsor of this video mizin let me thank them for a sec all non-stick pans lose their coating over time but miesen's pan has three distinct layers of non-stick all bonded to a durable layer of plasma primer underneath they say this pan will last two and a half times longer than a traditional non-stick and i believe it just like all mies and pans you can immediately tell how heavy and solid this is i don't understand how they sell you so much metal for so little money but there it is the comfy rubber handle slides off so you can use this in the oven when beginners ask me what pans to buy i say misen even when i'm not being paid to say so because i've become a true believer other pans in this price range feel like they're made out of aluminum foil as i've said you can cook eggs in carbon steel even stainless with some practice misen has tons of options on their site go there via my link in the description and use my code regucia you'll get 20 off your first order on this non-stick pan or anything 20 off with my link and code in the description just use my name ragusia thank you mizen so yeah with the basted egg you just have a lot more control you can see what you're doing you can spoon oil over particular areas of the egg that you want to cook more the yolk ends up much brighter not as cloudy as when you steam the top and as you can see the oil just rolls right off but you do have to lift the egg out of the oil which is surprisingly tricky on a gently cooked soft white egg i gotta just dive in eggs do not respect hesitancy same basting technique is gonna work at higher temperatures too i'm on medium heat now and you can see my white fluttering a bit spoon that hotter oil over the top and you get a nice bubbly fried effect all over if you're into that really good both of those basted eggs but to me there is one clearly superior way to cook a whole unbroken egg in a pan it is my favorite way of having eggs and it is eggs over easy gently foaming butter egg in the pan and first step is to cook the white until it's pretty solid it's been there two and a half minutes the bottom is set and that inner ring of white is just starting to set up that is my cue that this egg is just solid enough to flip without breaking it i slide it down to the edge of the pan so it's already up on its side i don't have to flip it much farther if you flip it too high the yoke will break on impact and there you can see i flipped it a little too low a little too gently but no harm done i'm not gonna lie that takes practice and i still screw it up all the time but eggs are cheap and all the mistakes are edible for a runny yolk it really only needs like 30 seconds on this side and you could just slide it directly onto the plate or you could flip it back around again some people think this top side is going to look nicer at this point the egg is solid enough to be flipped with a spatula if i'd used a spatula on the first flip i would have shredded that egg to ribbons that to me is the best way to have an egg though by the time i got my camera in position the yolk had overcooked a bit i'd call that over medium not over easy which is still good but with certain egg dishes you have to get it out of the pan the second that it's done or maybe even a few seconds before it's done as in the case of scrambled eggs crack a couple eggs in a bowl and people usually stir in a little salt one tiny pinch per egg is enough for me and then it's common to put in a little splash of milk or water when you beat this up the extra moisture just loosens everything up and makes it easier for the egg to expand and fluff up with steam in the pan either that or the extra water simply gives you more steam probably both scrambled eggs usually come out better with more fat in the pan and with the heat a little bit higher that's a not so gentle foam again i'm looking to create some steam that will give me a fluffy curd and i like to start scrambled eggs the way you would start an omelet stir constantly until it stops being stirrable until it just sets up on you the only difference is now you destroy the omelet just scrape the egg off the bottom then you get these big fluffy ribbons or sheets of curd they're still a little runny on the inside and if i want them to stay a little runny on the inside i have to get this out like 10 seconds ago it's already too late by the time i move my camera and reset my shot it's all over my curds are totally set with a little golden brown on them perfect for my wife but i like them runnier i assume the reason scrambled eggs are so time sensitive is they're getting intense heat from all sides unlike a sunny side up egg that's the same reason the over easy egg is more time sensitive heat from both sides please note by the way these are american style scrambled eggs french style scrambled eggs are more like a stirred custard we'll do those another day but just to give you frogs a thrill you can see me try to make a folded omelet i'm using a 10 inch pan and in a pan that big i need three eggs a minimum for an omelet with two eggs the omelet is so paper thin i always tear it same deal as before a little salt a little milk and it helps to really beat this very smooth beating it loosens up the protein structure so the eggs will flow much more readily into a solid thin sheet one time a dude in the comments castigated me for beating eggs with a fork instead of a whisk he said the fork is juvenile how do people like that function in the real world okay lots of butter for an omelette lots of butter even in a non-stick pan an omelette can still stick on you and i'm being sure to get butter up along the sides because egg is going to go up in there i'm doing an american style diner omelette so i've got my butter and aggressive foam a fancy french omelet you would cook at a much lower temperature i think stir stir stir wipe down the side and stir for as long as this mixture will remain liquid this helps it all cook rapidly and evenly the second it stops flowing into its own gaps i'll smush it all down into an even layer it's just plastic enough that i can do that though it won't be for long real quick now is when you can put in some fillings some fresh herbs are very nice i'm going to turn the heat off those eggs are done i'll grate on some lovely spanish cheese lauren bot i forget the name but man the spaniards know from cheese and i want to fold this before the top looks totally set it should still be a little gooey on top sometimes the bottom is solid enough that i can just grab one end but not today psy watch jacques papan if you want to see a professional do this i do suspect that one reason the traditional tri-fold shape developed is that it gives you not one but two chances to get it right there you go i'd be very happy to get that at a diner but the fancy french omelets that i've seen are not golden at all and they have a much smoother softer curd we'll try one of those another day and again this would have been perfect if i hadn't had to take 20 seconds to reset my shot it was a little gooey in the pan but it's pretty solid on the plate with eggs that get cooked from all sides you just gotta get them out before they are done to your liking but hey worst case scenario is you've got scrambled eggs and scrambled eggs are awesome plus you won't be juggling a camera while you're doing this it's gonna be way easier for you give eggs a shot they're great,3
Why Americans and Brits say 'cider' to mean very different things,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-R41YFcX8e4/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLCEjmUcKqEMhfFb64M7V9JWcP51Tg,-R41YFcX8e4,"12 minutes, 10 seconds","Thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this video!

squarespace in most of the english-speaking world this delightful relatively low alcohol fizzy drink made from apples is known as cider here in the united states we call this cider this is also made from apples but it has no alcohol at all and it is not fizzy we have the fizzy boozy stuff here in the united states too in fact it's actually been the fastest growing segment of our alcohol market now for over a decade but we do not call it cider instead we call it hard cider this we call cider and this we call apple juice and when it comes to food and drink this is one of the most divergent features of united statesian english no other anglophones anywhere else in the world distinguish between these three products in the same way that we do with the possible exception of a few confused canadians under our dubious influence why do we call this hard cider what exactly is hard about it and what is even the difference between american apple cider and apple juice come friends let us seek these answers together historically even apple hasn't always meant apple not in english not in lots of indo-european languages the word we use for apples today was once a generic word for pretty much any fruit and in this sense fruit is a generic word for any edible bulbous growth on a plant not just the ones that meet the strict botanical definition of fruit all of this is to explain why the french still use their word for apple to describe potatoes palm de terre apple of the earth that's what they call potatoes in french and because french is generally regarded as high class within anglophone society english-speaking chefs will often list mashed potatoes on their menu as palm puree and i've always wondered why palm puree describes mashed potatoes and not applesauce and now i know anyway in english they used the word apple to describe any fruit as recently as the 17th century this is despite the fact that malus domestica here had been very popular in britain since at least roman times the wild ancestor of the apple is native to central asia alma is the kazakh word for apple hence almaty appletown but the romans spread domesticated varieties all over their empire subsequent germanic settlers in england loved apples and then the french-speaking normans brought even more varieties to britain following their conquest of 1066. indeed apples were referred to as palm in english well into the modern period apples and pears and apples loved britain perfect climate there for the trees and the brits grew so-called dessert apples for eating like this it's a dessert apple one you just eat and they also grew cider apples for juicing according to the oxford english dictionary here cider and its etymological ancestors have basically always referred to some kind of alcoholic beverage going back to the hebrew word shekhar leviticus 10 8 and the lord spake unto aaron saying do not drink wine nor strong drink when you go into the tabernacle strong drink or intoxicant in hebrew was shekhar latin christians translated that to sikara which became cedro in italian and sidra in spanish and or something in old french and then the normans brought that to england where it became cider the oed's first record of the term apple juice is from early modern english i can't find any middle english term to describe the non-alcoholic product and maybe there's a reason for that apple juice wants to become alcoholic that is arguably its natural state where i grew up in central pennsylvania there was an orchard down the way from us that sold unfiltered apple juice pressed from late season apples this is what we call cider in the united states unfiltered or cloudy apple juice and because the stuff we got from that orchard was also unpasteurized it had not been heated to the point of killing all the microorganisms in here my older brother tony would just take these jugs and he'd put him into his bedroom closet and let him ferment you did nothing to them just held them there at room temperature in his closet and after a few weeks the tops would start to kind of buckle from all of the co2 pressure building up in here and then he would drink it it was probably a relatively low alcohol sparkly cider for the record kids i don't recommend that there's also a lot of bacteria that could propagate in there but anyway apples are naturally covered in yeast if you take unwashed apples off the tree and you smash them into juice and don't boil it or do anything else to it within a couple of weeks it'll probably be a weak alcoholic beverage and historically people would have allowed that to happen to make this a safer drink like we said there's also potentially some bad bacteria on the apples and the alcohol can help control those the result is a nutritious tasty drink that may be safer than the average peasant's local water supply and it has a low enough alcohol content that you can give it to children which they did all this is to say is that until very recently cider has always been a word that meant apple beer well technically i guess it's closer to wine than it is to beer though most stuff on the market is carbonated and maybe five to ten percent alcohol like beer so i think in effect it's closer to beer over here at maryville college the beer brewing chemistry professor dr nathan duncan is making his first hard cider as we americans would call it hard cider he's got pasteurized apple juice there this is from honeycrisp apples not from concentrate i read online that this is a good way to make cider if you're making it for the first time they heated it at the processing plant to kill any microorganisms including the yeast so he's got to add yeast back in so for this one i am going to use a british ale yeast that i also read online that some people say makes really good ciders that are well-rounded so i don't know it's just an experiment and here it is a few weeks later this is just fermented apple juice it's starting to clarify over time the sediment down here that's yeast some of it it's also some of it is just pulp because like i said it's unfiltered apple juice which again is what we americans call cider unfiltered apple juice though thanks to the yeast this has now become what the rest of the anglophone world would call cider now with this it's running a little bit below it's like 1.008 he's talking about the sugar content dr duncan can inductively reason that sugar is now alcohol and so this is probably about five percent alcohol yes brewing pet ants he knows that's a very rough estimate it is in fact a very bland cider it doesn't have a lot of doesn't have a lot of flavor to it i'm going to see if i can get it it smells right it does yeah i think it needs a little more time indeed it smells way better than it tastes alcoholic ciders are generally made with apples that are not very good for eating they may be very harsh very astringent from their high tannin content but those qualities give depth and body to the fermented cider and when english colonists arrived here in the land they called new england they found a climate very hospitable to orchards and they planted both dessert apples and cider apples it's a true story that when the pilgrims sailed to the new world they braced a broken beam on the mayflower using an iron screw from their cider press they knew what they planned to do with their new orchards alcoholic apple cider which of course would have been a redundant term to them alcoholic apple cider became a staple of the typical anglo-american colonial homestead later waves of german immigrants they brought beer that was their thing but for the english americans cider was where it was at they gave it to their kids they used it to make apple cider vinegar which was an essential product for food preservation and for cleaning and they converted it into much stiffer drinks sure you can distill cider into brandy but why bother during a frigid new england winter when you can just leave your cider outside if you really want to freeze it it takes liquid nitrogen temperatures to freeze ethanol however the water freezes at zero degrees and the liquid that remains unfrozen is going to have a higher concentration of ethanol because the ethanol doesn't freeze very well in the water eyes the resulting high alcohol hooch is called applejack and boy did they love that in new england and the parts of the midwest where new englanders resettled but it was among those same people those descendants of english puritans where the temperance movement was most fervent and that movement eventually led to prohibition the period in the early 20th century when alcoholic beverages were banned all across these united states beer managed to stumble through prohibition and the industry emerged alive on the other side maybe it's because the german immigrants didn't have the same english puritanical juju in their culture i don't know but for reasons that historians still really really argue about the hard cider industry did not survive prohibition it was completely wiped out by it it was dead on the other side from its ashes though came a new product sweet cider unfermented apple juice and then the industrialization of america's food system gave us another new product highly filtered and refined cider which came to be marketed as apple juice and so people called the cloudy equivalent cider to distinguish it as i understand it you brits have both of these don't you you've got what you call clear apple juice and cloudy apple juice here we call this apple juice and we just call this cider because by the time these products really emerged in competition with each other there really was no alcoholic cider on the market here in the united states though i'm sure that people with orchards still made it themselves at home and when we americans inevitably remembered how great alcoholic cider is and we started making it again at a commercial scale then we started calling it hard cider to distinguish it from sweet or soft cider which we by then we're just calling cider alcoholic beverages of course are hard and non-alcoholic beverages are soft according to the oxford english dictionary this is a unique feature of american english they have examples of that hard soft convention going back to the colonial period i would guess it's descended from an older feature of british english where they described harsh tasting drinks as being hard alcohol itself has a harsh taste so maybe that's why americans started calling boozy drinks hard drinks maybe because the alcohol they were producing was less refined less smooth and there you go there's the pretty straightforward explanation as to why we americans call this cider and we call this hard cider just because something is simple and straightforward doesn't mean it's not also valuable right i mean consider squarespace there's no simpler or more straightforward

thank you johnny appleseed the mytho-historical figure who planted apples all across this continent where of course they are not native did he do that so that future generations could eat or did he do

The 'right' color of raw beef,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/82KT_nb26-4/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLDm2GWAV62r1mhK9Bw5TNmKjplaDA,82KT_nb26-4,"9 minutes, 33 seconds",Thanks to Sealed Air for sponsoring this video! Learn more about vacuum packaging here: https://assets.mediafly.com/l/4Rh8TGG4Gzsu #cryovac #sealedair,2022-12-01 14:47:05.183328," This video is an ad for Sealed Air. Which
of these steaks looks fresher to you? Well, according to decades of meat industry research,
you probably think this one is fresher because the color is cherry red, whereas this one
is kind of purple. Consumers consistently demonstrate a preference for the red color.
But here's the thing: That difference in color is not a reliable indicator of freshness.
I mean, both of these particular steaks happen to be fresh and high quality. But if anything,
the purple color that we see on the vacuum-packed steak that is closer to the natural state
of the tissue. When an animal is slaughtered and bled out, the inside of the meat looks
like this. It looks purple. It doesn't look red. This is the original color. Even a dry
-ged section of meat that is months old — when you first crack it open, it's purple on the
inside. Not cherry red. Purple is good. Now, let's make something very clear. I am
being paid right now to tell you this. Sealed Air is a company that makes vacuum packing
equipment and materials for meat producers, among other industries. However, the reason
that I agreed to work with Sealed Air is that the message that it is in their interest for
me to deliver to you — well, that's a message that I've delivered here on this channel many
times before, without direct compensation for doing so. And I've done it because it's
true. It's 100% accurate and it's important. Vacuum packaging is good. A lot of giant producers
use vacuum packaging, and the stuff I usually like to buy from small, independent ranchers
— that's almost all vacuum packed, for good reason. And we consumers need to get over
our irrational aversion to this beautiful color. This color is good, and vacuum packing
cuts might actually be less wasteful than other packaging. We'll get back to that. The color of meat is largely determined by
the quantity and the state of the myoglobin contained therein. Myoglobin is the protein
that stores oxygen inside muscle tissue. It's similar to hemoglobin, which transports oxygen
in our blood. Both the hemoglobin in blood and the myoglobin in muscle contains a chemical
group known as heme, and heme is built around iron. It's this heme group that binds to oxygen
and is responsible for the warm colors we see in meat. Pork is less red than beef because pig muscle
contains less myoglobin, maybe two milligrams per gram of muscle. Cattle walk around and
graze all day so their muscle is evolved for sustained, low level effort, which requires
large reserves of oxygen, maybe eight milligrams of myoglobin per gram of beef. Depending on
the cut and the age of the animal, it could have even more than that. Whether that myoglobin looks purplish or reddish
or even brownish depends largely on its exposure to oxygen. The form of myoglobin that looks
purplish is deoxymyoglobin. And within minutes of taking this out of the package, you can
see it oxidizing into oxymyoglobin. I shot a time lapse of this steak over a period of
three days. And I'll show that to you while Michael Rosinski explains what's happening.
He's the marketing director and a trained meat scientist with Sealed Air. ""Let's start with deoxymyoglobin. That's the
native form of the pigment when it's inside your body. Okay. So when that myoglobin is
then exposed to oxygen in the air, which is roughly 20.9% of our atmosphere, it turns
into that bright red color because of the oxygenation of that pigment. And it will stay
in that state for a period of time. But over time, that pigment will begin to change color
and turn into the brown color, the metmyoglobin."" If you ever see beef at the store with surface
browning, that's metmyoglobin. That's an indication that the steak was cut or the meat was ground
more than a couple of days ago. And you know, many times in my life, I have brought meat
home that had little patches of brown on it and I have lived to tell the tale. I am not
here to freak you out about that. There isn't necessarily anything really wrong with the
color itself. It's more that it's an indicator that other things could have gone wrong during
the time that it took to turn that meat brown. As the meat surface is exposed to air, thus
changing the color, aerobic bacteria and other microorganisms can grow and cause spoilage
— slime on the surface, funky smells. Also the fats in the meat oxidize, causing funky
smells — rancidity. Those things aren't caused by the browning, but they are corollaries
of the browning. Those processes start happening the second that you cut the meat, thus exposing
it to oxygen. Even if you wrap it up loosely in plastic
afterward, which is what a grocery store typically does, there's enough air in there that you
start to lose that beautiful purple color and all of those other bad reactions start
unfolding. With vacuum packaging, you can cut it and then you can isolate it from oxygen
all over again — put it under vacuum. And that vacuum delays all of those other spoilage
processes. The problem, of course, is that then the meat looks purple, and we consumers,
irrationally, do not like that. The industry is always working on ways of
extending that cherry red color of freshly oxidized meat that they know we like. They
can feed the cattle lots of the antioxidant we call Vitamin E. That helps. Refrigeration
can delay that color change. Shall we say, creative lighting in the meat case can make
it look redder for longer. Also the atmosphere. There's a big thing in the meat industry called
modified atmosphere packaging, MAP, and that's where they pack the meat in air that is different
from the normal air, like very high carbon dioxide air. That'll slow the color change.
But unless you treat the meat with nitrates that bind to the heme proteins, that browning
is inevitable and always has been. That's what we see on the surface of this old-fashioned
dry aged piece. You'd generally trim that away, perhaps before vacuum packing the resulting
purple steak and then selling it. Walker Stockley is with the sustainability team at Sealed
Air. ""Back before the days of Cryovac and vacuum
packaging, all the meat was sent to supermarkets like you see in the picture behind me — sides
of beef hanging on a rail. And then the butcher had to cut up the whole carcass. Those days
don't exist anymore. More than 95% of the beef is coming to back of store in a vacuum
package. The butcher is getting the benefit of the shelf life and the color protection.
And then it he's opening that bag and giving the consumer something that's shorter shelf
life."" And that's a really important thing for us
all to understand. You may think, ""Oh, vacuum packing, that's bad. It's wasteful — all
of this plastic."" Well, consider the alternative. The meat that you buy at the grocery store
— it all came vacuum packed. That's how it got there. Then your butcher took it out,
maybe cut it down into steaks and then wrapped it up again in plastic and put it on a big
styrofoam tray, maybe. That's not exactly less wasteful. Or maybe they took it out of
the plastic, broke it down into steaks and then put it into a case. And then you asked
for the steak, the butcher reaches in wearing a temporary disposable plastic glove — reaches
in there, pulls out the steak and puts it onto butcher paper that's shiny on the inside.
Why? Because it's lined in plastic. If you eat meat, there's going to be a lot of plastic
involved, no matter how you do it — unless you are, like, slaughtering the animal on
your farm and then taking it directly into your kitchen, which is great, but not realistic
for all of us. Depending on the particular product and its
supply chain, there might actually be less packaging waste when cuts are individually
vacuum packed at the slaughterhouse. And there is almost certainly less food waste when meat
is vac packed. This is something we've talked about here before. I'm quite convinced that the biggest environmental
problem is global warming and there's research indicating that the most effective way to
lower the carbon footprint of food is to produce and market less of it. That means those of
us who maybe eat a little too much food should probably just eat less of it, for any number
of reasons. It's also the case that we should stop wasting food. That's the big problem
in terms of carbon footprint. Properly vacuum packed meat can last weeks in the fridge and
years in the freezer. This is why small-scale producers have moved almost exclusively to
packaging systems like the ones that Sealed Air provides. You have to be running a super
high-volume business in order to sell oxygenated cherry red cuts of beef before they spoil.
Only the big guys can do that. And even then they end up throwing out a ton of spoiled
meat. So to conclude, there is no right color of
beef. Even brown can be great in the context of a properly dry aged chunk of meat. Bright
cherry red can be great if it's an indication that the steak was cut this morning, and it's
only been oxygenating in the case for a few hours. But purple is also great. Purple's
really great. This is the true color of preservation, and we need to get over any irrational aversion
we may have to it. Many thanks to Sealed Air for sponsoring this
video and supporting my work here on the channel. Check them out at the links below and read
all about the solutions they provide to folks in this industry. If you eat beef, my advice remains same as
ever. Buy better stuff maybe a little bit less often. Enjoy it more. And don't waste
a single gram — not in the package, not in the trash bag, and certainly not off that
cutting board.",3
Black and white cookies | NY-style dense cake with crispy icing,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8S5vkk2ZHV4/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLBoRVqpLpQg3y4lZ2UOelnoSQchpA,8S5vkk2ZHV4,"8 minutes, 32 seconds","Thanks to Magic Spoon for sponsoring this video!

If you’re watching...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.183328," The secret to black and white cookies is they
are not made from cookie dough. It's cake batter that you bake in dollops as if it were
cookies, and then the glaze is basically just Christmas cookie icing. You could use any
yellow cake batter recipe you like, but the classic New York-area black and whites I grew
up eating tend to be much closer to pound cake. Very heavy, very dense. In fact I'm starting with my pound cake recipe.
A cup of granulated sugar, 200g. A stick and a half of softened butter, 170g. I softened
that in the microwave on very low power for just a few seconds. And I will cream that
into the sugar until very fluffy. Oops, I forgot the other half a stick. I think it
helps to do this kind of thing in the narrowest bowl that will suffice. A narrow bowl allows
you to keep more of the mixture in contact with the beaters at any given time. It really takes a lot to get this as fluffy
as it needs to be, which is why I probably would not bother doing this without a power
tool of some kind. Gotta get it to where it kinda looks like mayonnaise. Something like
that. If it's not fluffy, it'll be kinda hard and crunchy once baked in cookie form, which
is not what I'm after. I want dense yet soft. To that end, I'll put in half a cup of sour
cream, 120g. You could use any soft fermented milk situation. I usually use buttermilk for
poundcake because it lightens it a bit. But for these cookies I don't want light. I want
heavy, yet soft. Sour cream is great for that, so is greek yogurt. And I've got the mixture looking mayonnaise-y
again, so time for eggs. Two eggs. Pretty standard for a poundcake of this scale. I'll
mix in my other wet ingredients with these. Lots of New York bakeries traditionally use
lemon juice or lemon extract here. I think that clashes with the chocolate icing, so
I'm doing a big splash of vanilla and then a little splash of almond extract, which you
could skip. Mix that up nice and smooth and fluffy, then
I can start beating in about two cups of all-purpose flour, 240g, a little at a time so that it
doesn't explode everywhere. Hey, did you know clouds of flour dust are highly combustible?
That's a thing. Look it up. A little more flour now, and I'll put in my
other dry ingredient. A quarter teaspoon of baking soda to neutralize the acidity of the
sour cream. I like acidity, of course, but that taste just isn't traditional here, to
me. And that could be enough leavening right there,
but to be safe I'm throwing in half a teaspoon of baking powder. You normally don't need
any chemical leavening in poundcake batter. The whipped-up butter does the trick. But
a cake can climb the walls of the pan as it bakes, which stabilizes the structure as it
puffs up. This batter will have nothing to climb, so I think some chemical leavening
helps keep the cookies from baking too flat. That's all mixed in and I'll do the last bit
of flour. You could put in even more flour — that'd probably get you taller cookies,
to a point. But you also gotta remember that black and whites tend to dry a bit over the
time it takes for the icing to set, and more flour means drier baked goods. That looks
good to me. I'll give it a taste, the raw eggs being a
minor health risk that I'm willing to take. You do you. Since I used salted butter, I
only want a tiny pinch more. If I'd used unsalted butter I'd probably start with a half a teaspoon
of the Morton kosher salt I use for most things. That's done. The first of two baking sheets,
parchment paper really helps when it comes to peeling these off later, especially if
you do big cookies. I'm scooping out like half a cup of batter for each cookie. The bakery I remember going to on Long Island
made black and white cookies the size of dinner plates, or at least that's how I recall them.
I was proportionally much smaller at the time. I'm spacing these really far apart, because
they're gonna spread a ton. Drat, it looks like I'm gonna get seven. I was shooting for
eight. One is the only odd-number allowed among baked goods! I would guess pro bakers pipe out this batter
to get perfect rounds. Unless I'm working at a commercial scale I usually think piping
bags take more effort than they're worth. What I can do instead is wet my hands with
water — that will allow me to shape these into something more round without the batter
sticking to me. I've seen people use the same water film trick to handle super-sticky pizza
doughs. It works real good. It the oven at like 350ºF/180ºC convection
bake. If you don't have a convection fan I'd go a little hotter. In my oven, I'm guessing
those will take about 20 minutes. In the meantime, I can sit down and beg forgiveness for all
the sugar I'm about to eat. Bless me, father, for it's been a couple weeks

Looking pretty good. You shouldn't expect them to brown all the way on top. I'll pat
this to feel if the inside is cooked. It's still a little squishy. I'll give that a few
more minutes. Here we are after maybe 22. They should still
look a little under-baked. If they're not, they're gonna be dry by the time we actually
eat them. Let those cool all the way down and solidify before peeling them off the paper,
which shouldn't be too hard. There, the bottoms are the tops — the flat side is the one
you ice. Speaking of which... You'll need a big pile of powdered sugar.
I would guess six cups — like 700g, at least. It may seem like a lot, but it's good to have
extra. You don't want to run out in the middle of the job. Corn syrup — you don't have
to use this, but just a little corn syrup will make the icing shinier and softer. It's
a different kind of sugar so it interferes in crystallization. I'm just eyeballing a
couple tablespoons. I want the icing pretty firm when it's dried, but not shattering into
shards when I bite through it. Now it's time to stir in just enough water
or milk to dissolve this into a glaze, and it'll take way less than you think. I mean,
what was that — a quarter cup, maybe? I'll stir that up and yep, that was a little too
much liquid. I want this very thick so I get a nice thick layer of glaze on top of the
cookie. A little more sugar to compensate. If there are lumps, I wouldn't bother getting
out a whisk. I'd just let this sit a few minutes and then stir it again. Everything should
dissolve. And you could put in a little bit of vanilla, but there's plenty in the cake,
and I want to keep the color bright. That looks perfect — very thick, but still spreadable. Again, I'm sure the bakeries would pipe this.
If you have something a little wider than a butter knife, that'd make this go a little
faster, but anything will do. My approach is to first drizzle the straight line down
the middle, and then flood the rest of the white half. Slap a lot of extra icing on.
If there's too little to spread you'll risk breaking up the surface of the cookie and
getting crumbs mixed into the icing. Any excess will just drip down off the side and we can
break it off later. The chocolate half will be much easier to
apply it you let the first half set up nice and firm, for maybe an hour. In the meantime,
we can convert the remaining icing into chocolate. I would guess three or four tablespoons of
cocoa powder, but again, it's the kind of thing you can just eyeball and then taste.
I think dutched cocoa is traditional, both for the flavor and for the darker color it
provides, but natural would be fine. You'll probably need a little extra liquid
to get it all dissolved or dispersed. Some people put in melted solid chocolate — very
dark chocolate, or even unsweetened chocolate. You can do that if you want a gooey texture
to contrast the smooth, crisp texture of the white icing. I just want the chocolate side
a little gooier, so I'll add a little more corn syrup to do that. That tastes good to me, but it's not as dark
in color as I want it. It's a black and white cookie, not a brown and white. So, I will
start stirring in a little blue food coloring. Blue plus brown pigment should equal black.
I don't want it literally black, but I do want it very dark brown. There we go. I'll just drizzle this down on the cookies
with a spoon at first. Now that the white icing is solid, it should form a solid flood
bank, keeping that chocolate from spilling over into the wrong side of the cookie. Again,
just drizzle on the straight line, flood the rest and then I'll switch to my knife to kinda
pull it the rest of the way down the side. Straight line drizzle, flood, pull. Straight
line drizzle, flood, pull. It's a dance craze! Now the hardest part — let that set overnight.
I really don't think they taste right until the next day. Sorry, honey. ""Can I eat one now?"" ""No."" ""Now?"" ""No!"" ""I want to eat one!"" So yeah, the next day you can just lift one
up and kinda snap off any excess icing, or if you want a little cleaner edge you can
go around with a butter knife down on the pan. We could have also let these drain on
wire racks, but that would have made a big mess. I think these are great — totally
tastes like what I grew up eating on Long Island when I visited by grandma. You can
see the density of the crumb there. The best part is the two-for-one tastes you
get — you can have bites that are all chocolate, all white, or different combinations of the
two. Textbook heterogeneity. A classic for a reason.",3

talking about the edible fungus that's referred to as a truffle not the chocolate that's named after the fungus people are obsessed with these and i mean for reference i paid about 35 for each of these little burgundy truffles and this is not even a very highly prized species the burgundy truffles are just what's in season right now in the fall it's what i could get a true black truffle or paragord is probably the most popular species that's a winter truffle and it's got a lot stronger flavor for me to get a nice black paragord truffle about this size from the same place online it would cost about sixty dollars for just a little one like that to get a white truffle about this size would cost about 250 dollars and that's when you can even get them look i'm not here to convince you these little funguses are definitely worth it i'm just here to explain what the deal is why truffles are incredibly hard to cultivate and why people go mad for them also why you need adorable little doggies to find them for you find it schmuzzles the dog's q word to go find truffles is chuzzles truffles are from a genus of fungal species known as tuber that grow around the base of trees healthy living trees this is really different from other mushrooms we eat that grow through dead wood and leaves and such those are scavengers of the forest truffles don't eat dead trees instead they live with trees that's why you can't grow them in big blocks of sawdust or compost inside like you can with other mushrooms truffles are a unique type of fungus they're mycorrhizal fungi so they obtain sugars from the roots of the host tree but then they also collect nutrients from the soil and provide those to the host tree so it's a symbiotic relationship ella reeves and her colleague katie learn there are research assistants who help look after this truffle orchard it's run by north carolina state university it's an experimental farm where they're trying to figure out how to grow these things in the appalachian mountains of north america where they are not native at least not this particular species the aforementioned black truffle tuber melanosperm they are native to regions in europe like france where there is a heavy limestone in the soil so very high ph already think about the rock of gibraltar that's a giant hunk of limestone right here on this eu map showing soil ph warm colors are high ph spain southern france northern italy a little into the balkans this is where your classic black truffles grow wild and are farmed with relative ease they like to grow around hardwoods these are filbert hazelnut trees in the north carolina orchard and here's how you farm truffles on them trees are actually inoculated in the nursery with the tuber melanosporum which is the truffle producing fungus and once they're inoculated and there's a pretty heavy population inside the roots they're planted in an orchard formation like you can see around and they need a highly limed soil so a very high ph to grow so that they can out compete the native fungi once down there the white mycelium of the fungus fans out and effectively extends the root network of the trees it sucks up water and mineral nutrients and it passes those on to the roots in exchange for carbs carbs that the trees photosynthesize with their leaves eventually once tree and fungus are both big and strong enough the fungus will be ready to reproduce and it will send up a fruiting body this is the part of basically all edible funguses that we actually eat the fruiting body it's this temporary reproductive projection whose job is to grow up and then send out the spores cast off the spores so they will go far and wide and make new funguses elsewhere cut it open and you can see the so-called marbling of this truffle and you can see the payload of brown spores ready to pop out from the time you plant the inoculated tree to the time you get edible fruiting bodies is an agonizingly long weight those hazelnut trees are popular for this in part because they get you truffles relatively quickly and by quick i mean you can expect to get your first little crop of edible fruiting bodies about seven years after you have planted your hazelnut trees and that's assuming that everything went right in the meantime the lab techs here at the north carolina state mountain research station can help you make sure that it's going right you can bring a soil sample or some roots from your trees and ella reeves and colleagues will try to make sure you've got the right fungus growing in there this might include isolating some dna and having it sequenced that's a nucleotide sequence she's looking out there jeans in this case this wasn't even a tuber species this was a contaminant it was it's very osprella well that's bad news and truffle farmers get a lot of bad news here's a super sad story in 1999 a guy named tom michaels planted some inoculated hazelnut trees pretty close to where i live here in east tennessee michaels is a phd plant pathologist he did his dissertation research on truffles he's already had a long career growing button mushrooms and when he finally tried truffle farming he naturally did just about everything right the climate and the geology around here is pretty close to those traditional truffle growing regions in europe so michael's was definitely doing this in the right spot and after nearly a decade of waiting he suddenly started getting bumper crop after bumper crop of real black paragord truffles right here in east tennessee tom michaels was then and arguably still is the only person to ever produce true black truffles on anything close to a major commercial scale here in the americas the new york times wrote a big feature about him he was a celebrity among american celebrity chefs and then his trees got this thing called eastern filbert blight and he had to cut almost all of them down same thing happened here at the experimental orchard in north carolina eastern filbert blight they had to cut all of these down but they are growing back could there be black diamonds down there well that's what lois martin and her truffle dog manza are here to find out we found up to 40 some truffles in this orchard two years ago last year we only found two and so we don't know what will what will happen how stressed the trees were the second planting would that's much larger denser that we have not found anything in yet and it's it's due manza is a legato roman yolo a breed used in italy to sniff out truffles manza and her human lois are among the very few professional truffle hunting teams available for hire in this hemisphere a well-trained dog like this should be able to sniff out any truffles down there the truffles want to be found the pungent aroma for which we prize them has literal pheromones in it the whole point is to attract animals who will come and dig up the fruiting bodies and thus distribute the spores far and wide even the inferior human nose can detect a really ripe truffle from across the room but doggies are way better at it especially for an early season check like this is you train them to associate the odor with a treat with a reward for centuries in europe they used pigs to sniff out truffles problem was the pigs would eat the truffles whereas dogs if they're well trained they will not eat a truffle there are some romantic ideas that if you feed the dogs some truffle that they'll they'll fi they'll find the truffles but the problem is then they may start eating the ones that are restaurant quality grade that you would prefer selling intact but manza would never do anything like that no would you you're a good doggy monster and hey has she got something over there we have something it would be a really big deal if she's got something especially this early in the season it would mean this blighted orchard is back it would mean there's hope for all the wannabe truffle farmers around here who've sunk untold time and money into a dream that so far only one guy tom michaels has been able to realize only to have it snatched away from him a few years later it would be a big deal if there's a truffle on those roots uh no ma'am forget it i feel yamanza i mean these do kind of look like surely there are people in this hemisphere who've managed to farm truffles successfully in northern california and the pacific northwest yeah there are people doing it but it's on a pretty small scale and the reason american chefs want a local product is these are only super fragrant for a short while they are casting off their volatile organic compounds into the wind like confetti by the time you get them from europe they might be only really good for a couple more days and the smell is what it's all about these hardly taste like anything truffles are all about those very powerful but ephemeral aromas i've heard it described as animal musk before um it's it's really like a it's like a a woodsy earthy earthy i think that's the word yeah well whatever it is the most common way of getting real truffle into food is to shave it paper thin onto something hot and steamy that's too thick the slices i'm doing better over here on the risotto you shave the raw fungus on top there's just enough heat and moisture there to unlock some more of the aromas if you cook them much more than that you drive most of the aromas away probably the most common way of getting truffle flavor into food is not with truffles but with infusions truffle oil and most of the stuff that's on the market is fake not made with actual truffles though they have put in the bioidentical compounds in here to make it smell of truffle and i don't know people get snobby about this stuff but i think it's real good and you generally don't cook it you just use it as a raw finishing oil on food the traditional way they make truffle oil is to take any leftover crumbles or otherwise unsuitable fragments of truffle and you just throw them into some oil of course fats are tremendously good at absorbing and trapping and then carrying aromas that's actually what lois martin is doing in these little baggies of hers she's got a block of butter in there to grab the smells cast off by this little guy that manza found on a different hunt notice it's brown and smooth not rough and black that is not a paragord truffle so we're smelling what we the tuber leoni eye which is also known as the pecan truffle and it's a native truffle to the united states we find it frequently in orchards even if they're planted with the european varieties at least that's what she thinks it is they're still waiting on genetic test results but this lab full of truffle nerds is pretty jazzed to smell a native truffle one that actually wants to grow in the americas and i would describe it as an early summer evening breeze so the obvious question is why bother growing paragords here in the americas if we have these native ones here that smell so amazing why not just grow those and eat those well the local ones are not as highly prized why is that the case well maybe it's because they simply aren't the european delicacy that everybody already knows and loves maybe it's because they aren't as expensive as the european ones i'm hardly expert enough to give you an opinion on that but i will tell you this i have once in my life had shavings of a white truffle that's the ultra expensive king of all truffle species i'm pretty sure the specimen that i'd been served was good and fresh and well prepared and i thought it was a huge letdown to me it just tasted like a weaker black truffle and google it like i'm not the only person to have that opinion though lots of people find nicer ways of saying it they say oh the white truffle is very delicate well if you want less truffle flavor then just use less truffle don't buy a more expensive truffle so that you can use more of it that doesn't make any sense but anyways that's what i personally think the whole white truffle thing is about i think people like them because they are rare and expensive they are rare and expensive because they are rare and expensive and now i'm sure you can head down to the comments and read all about why i'm wrong about that but if you really want to read up on truffles and the crazy people who try to grow them you gotta check out this new book by the food writer rowan jacobson it's called truffle hound manza and her human lois martin are featured in this chapter if you don't have time to read an

My guide to stuffing:...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.183328, i have been and remain an advocate of simple roast turkey with gravy but this is a more involved approach that i've been wanting to try for a while i fully de-boned this turkey before roasting it and i use the bones to make a turkey demi-glass which is delicious what i like about this method is all the hard work is done in advance on the day of your big holiday feast all you do is throw a pan in the oven and slicing up boneless meat could not be easier the sauce you just reheat you're done i'd suggest starting two days out from said feast though you could start the day before this is a big turkey 20 pounds nine kilos but you can do this with any size bird and i'll get some kitchen scissors and my boning knife but you could use any really sharp knife flip the bird around so that you're looking at its backbone there are only four places where the skeleton protrudes up through the meat the shoulder joints there and the hip joints down here other than those four points all the meat is just sitting on top of the bones so all you have to do is peel it off i've cut straight down along one side of the spine now i'll just let my knife follow the bones and you can feel them super easy just slowly peel the meat off of that central skeleton and i've hit my first joint the hip joint there lots of people have lots of ways of getting through the joints here's my crude but easy approach grab kitchen scissors get them around the joint grip down and then twist hard just kind of lever that joint around until you start to dislocate it when you open it up a bit you can get in with your scissors and start snipping away at the ligaments and other stuff connecting that femur to the pelvic girdle i'm through and that whole hip and leg quarter is now free up here i've hit the shoulder joint and i'll do the exact same thing get my scissors around the joint twist to lever it apart a bit and then i can snip or cut the ligaments attaching the humerus to the scapula both joints on this side are now cut so i am free and clear i can just keep peeling meat off of the ribs one little slice at a time following the bones with my knife we're cutting the breast meat off now and i'm gonna stop when i reach the very bottom which will be the sternum the breastbone that half of the bird is now free so i can keep using my dominant hand i'll simply rotate the bird to do the other side yes i'm doing this directly on my counter i'm gonna have to spray down this counter no matter what i do so i figure there's no point in trying to do this on a little cutting board everything is gonna spill out anyway again i'm just peeling the meat off the backbone until i hit a joint and i can't go any further there's the other hip joint i can feel it even though i can't see it i'll just get in with my scissors grab the joint and twist to dislocate it if you do not yet have basic knowledge of bird anatomy i would not recommend doing this break down a few whole chickens cooked and raw before you attempt anything ambitious as this i'm through the hip and now i can peel off the rest of the leg quarter real easy one more joint to go and honestly the wing or shoulder joint here is small enough even on a big turkey that you can dislocate it by hand this is how i normally do all the joints on a chicken just pop the joint and now that it's loose you can easily get your knife in there and cut through any tissue still holding the joint together start peeling that breast meat off of the ribs and the breast bone and now the british and french sides of the chunnel have converged just peel the meat off the sternum there maybe just break off the wishbone and the central skeleton or carcass is free i'll just put that over here with the neck and the giblets all great stuff for the gravy or demi-gloss there are a few bits of cartilage still hanging out around where the breastbone was i'll trim those out next challenge is to get the leg and thigh bones out first just cut straight down to the thigh bone and then peel some meat off the sides then i'll slip my knife in and under oops that's actually facing the wrong way get the knife facing out and then saw out toward where the hip was that end of the femur is now free same process on the knee and the shin bone there the tibia just cut straight down across the length of it and then start to peel meat off the sides until you can see what you're doing now i think i'll just grab the hip bone and start sawing underneath the knee peeling that off peeling the tibia off the meat underneath and then once i get down around the ankle i'll just lever those bones over and the scissors make it real easy to snip all that off save that for the sauce what's left are these tendons that are so huge on a big turkey they're like little bones they make most of the turkey leg virtually inedible but with this method we can pull them out i wish i could say you can grab them with a paper towel or your scissors but honestly pliers are the tool for the job grab the tendon by the end hold the meat back with your other hand and pull hard you can pull all those out like porcupine needles save for sauce same over here saw out under the femur that's free cut down along the knee and the tibia peel some meat off the sides grab the thigh bone get under with the knife and saw out toward the ankle scissors are great for snipping where those tendons join up down near the ankle bones are free use the pliers to pull out the tendons the wings honestly you could just cut off whole and throw them in with the sauce there's not much great meat on them i am deboning the upper portion by just cutting straight down along the humerus and peeling the meat off the sides in chicken wing terminology this is the drumette that's some good meat i'll slip my knife under the bone and saw out the winglets i'm not going to bother fighting for and certainly not the wing tip at the end all of that will just cut off whole and save for the sauce now i'll just look around for anything left that i don't want to eat any little bits of cartilage hanging around any super blubbery globs of fat if i'm gonna go through all this work i want the roast that i have left to be 100 edible and all these trimmings are great for sauce last thing is i'll just flip back these pectoralis minor muscles also known as the poultry tenderloin just fold them out and the meat will sit at a much more even thickness to that same end i'll butterfly the thickest part of the breast a little bit just one or two shallow cuts to that thick part to get it to lie a little flatter so that it will cook in the same time as the rest i know this looks like a failed experimental surgery right now but just wait till it's cooked we're done let's take a break maybe i'll scan my grocery receipt with fetch rewards the sponsor of this video we all tend to spend a lot of money around the holidays but you can

in code in the description thanks fetch rewards back to the scene of the crime i'm not the biggest fan of this but with everything wide open here it would be very easy to do a quick salt cure or dry brine on this meat just put on as much salt as you would normally use to flavor this much meat no more no less might as well put on some other seasonings while we're here lots of pepper and maybe some herbs dried thyme and sage classic for the holiday and also nice on this side would be some garlic powder and onion powder okay flip her around and that looks better already doesn't it but a 20 pound bird all flayed out like this is too big to fit on my baking tray i could cut it in half through the breast and have two mirror image halves but i'm going to snip the leg quarters off there's basically only skin attaching the breast to the thigh here so it should be very obvious where to cut and now i can put my dark meat on one tray and my white meat on another that's a bonus they cook really differently and now we have independent control over them again as much salt on the skin as you would normally use to season right before cooking no more no less it's mostly going to be absorbed into the meat during the curing process pepper two and i'll do some of those same herbs but no garlic or onion powder those things tend to burn under intense dry heat they'll be protected on the underside but not on top here last thing is to kind of tuck any exposed meat up under the skin when the meat is exposed in the fridge it goes leathery when the skin dries out it gets crispy and delicious in the fridge uncovered the point here is to dry out the skin like they do for peking duck normal food safety protocol is to put raw meat at the bottom of the fridge in case it leaks you don't want it leaking down onto your food but i'm pretty sure these trays are secure and if i put them on top my kids won't be able to reach them when they're groping around in the fridge for snacks them bones and they go to my roasting tray with the neck the skin any trimmings i'll cut a couple of onions in half and drop those in in the oven at like 400 fahrenheit 200c to roast and develop some brown flavor after like half an hour i'll squirt on a little tomato paste that will not make this tomatoey it'll just boost the umami in the end and darken the color a bit then i'll flip the pieces around a little tomato paste on the bones is a pretty common trick for demi-gloss i find that if i put it on at the very beginning it burns whatever you do don't let anything burn like see i'm starting to get a few black bits there that's bad with a demi-gloss all the flavors get majorly concentrated i should have pulled this out a few minutes earlier that was about an hour and normally i'd transfer these into a big stock pot but i'm gonna try simmering this right here in my roasting tray it's already dirty and i think it'll be just big enough the culinary school types tell you to start a stock in cold water this is because the albumin protein found in meat does not dissolve in hot water i don't think it makes a meaningful difference but i am using my filtered water from the fridge because everything is going to be concentrated and the knoxville tap water does not taste so great making water was way better i'll be able to get everything submerged as it all cooks down and softens this is super optional but for some umami boost i'm throwing in a handful of dried porcini turkey gravy is often boosted with mushrooms tastes real good some whole peppercorns in and maybe bay leaves will do something in there i doubt it bring that up to a boil reduce to a simmer i don't have a lid for this so foil two pieces i'll just let that go for a couple hours and here we are looking good i'll stir everything around and things are starting to fall apart so i can get everything submerged now gotta top off the water though to have a nice stock to make gravy you could honestly stop right there but i'm making demi-gloss which is thickened with gelatin not starch so i need to dissolve all the collagen in there into gelatin which will take a while i'm now about to go to bed so i'll give it one more stir top off the water and make sure it's just barely bubbling i don't want all that water to evaporate while i'm asleep because then everything would burn here we are the next day simmering roasted bones for this long tends to throw off some pretty intense smells don't be dismayed if it's kind of gross at this stage i used to do this on a hot plate outside until i got a decent kitchen exhaust system grab a bone and if it breaks real easy that's a sign you've extracted all you can i simmered this about 16 hours it's the day before the feast now i'm just fishing out most of the solids this will make it a lot easier for me to pass everything through a strainer in a sec before i take these to the compost i'll pour any liquid from the bowl back in now i'm going to bring this to a boil and reduce it down by maybe a third just so it's smaller and easier to deal with here's a cheat a packet of unflavored gelatin you don't have to do that we've got plenty of gelatin in there already but this is for a big feast i want lots of sauce to feed lots of people and a little extra gelatin will allow me to get that texture that i want without reducing it down quite as much that powder tends to clump so that's why i'm letting it boil for a while to dissolve and then everything is going through a sieve you gotta cool this down fast and there's lots of ways to do that today i'm doing the huge bowl filled with ice water and the smaller bowl nested inside sieve on stock goes through i was sure to stop boiling this before it thickened up very much at this stage if you reduce it down too thick a lot of it will stick to the remaining bones and such and you'll lose it plus if it's too thick the fat will not separate out as cleanly as we chill this down it won't be able to escape and rise to the surface you can already see that fat rising up stir this around let it transfer all its heat down through that metal bowl and into the ice water it's amazing how fast this cools down which is good because it's a high protein low sodium low acid solution that could be very hospitable to microbes 10 minutes later give it one more stir it's barely lukewarm i'll pull that out cover it up because fat absorbs smells in the fridge you can also put this in the freezer if you're in a hurry later that same day here we are the fat has surfaced and solidified or has it that's plenty cold but it's still pretty liquid which means this turkey is relatively low in saturated fat it's not like doing this with beef where the fat is a solid puck on top that you can just lift off this is still pretty easy though because the stock underneath is a very firm block of jello i'm not penetrating it at all as i scrape the fat off the top that's plenty clean and now you could totally just make the world's best gravy by frying an equal quantity of flour in this fat to make a roux let it brown a bit stir in the stock boil until thickened you're done but i'm not doing that this time i'm going to save this fat for a thing this meaty jello i will transfer to my widest pan or at least as much of it as i can fit in there i'm not making that mistake twice get that boiling down and concentrating until syrupy a meat glaze this concentrated cannot hold fat inside itself without a lot of emulsifying help so that's why we had to get all the fat out to make demi-glass now i can fit in the rest without any danger of this boiling over you don't have to stir this constantly until it starts to get really syrupy then you gotta move it stuff could stick to the bottom or the sides and burn that's looking very nice tasting very nice i think i'm gonna put like a glass of white wine in there i think that'll brighten this up give it some floral notes that'll be very festive and the sweetness will be nice but really really stir or do this at a lower temperature for a much longer time it'd be a tragedy to burn it and there's lots of sugar in there now that sugar burns a gelatin thickened sauce like this will be much thicker at eating temperature so when you think you're close you might want to turn the heat off a bit and then assess i'd say that's looking just right time to season there's no salt in this yet other than the salts that were naturally in the animal this is hilarious it is so glossy that my camera cannot focus on it then you can just scrape all that into a bowl chill and reheat tomorrow tomorrow is today the big feast all you do is pull the trays out of the fridge after 48 hours the skin is really dry and most of the salt has been absorbed deep into the meat which is good if you're into that 400 fahrenheit 200c i will stop and baste the skin once or twice if you want crazy crispy skin do not baste just rub the skin down with oil before you put it in the oven and never touch it again there's some water in these basting juices that'll reduce our final crispiness just a little bit but i think the flavor will be better so that's a trade-off i am comfortable with if this turkey was on the bone it would take five hours at least off the bone it's been just over an hour and the white meat is almost done the dark meat is done normally dark meat takes longer than white meat but off the bone the pieces are way smaller there's more surface area so that's already at 185 fahrenheit 85c and that's my preferred internal temp for dark meat you can cook it a little bit less white meat you definitely don't want to take past 160 fahrenheit 71c carryover heat will easily take it a few degrees further into what they say are the minimum safe temperatures as it rests i might put the dark meat back in the oven just to warm it back up again if you want more color just jack the heat way up at the very end but i think turkey tastes best when it's kind of blonde so there's everything enough meat for a dozen people at least if this were gravy that wouldn't be nearly enough sauce but this glaze is far more intense than gravy so you don't need as much however if you want more sauce volume you could stir in a bunch of butter at the last minute as long as the heat is really low nothing is bubbling you should be able to melt this in without breaking the natural emulsion of the butter people often finish demi-gloss-based sauces with butter it works great if anything it makes the flavor much more delicious it changes the texture it maybe makes it a little warmer or fluffier on the palette that's the only way i can think to describe it the pure demi is just more glazy i actually set aside half of my demi to keep it pure you're only looking at the other half right now and by slowly melting in butter i've nearly doubled my sauce volume which is great for a big family meal give that a taste and re-season especially if you used unsalted butter here's half of that breast ready to slice and lauren is always the skin thief [Applause] that's so good indeed the salt cure and the air drying have made that skin incredibly crisp and tasty and here's the best part of this whole deal i can just slice this up on the board it's not up in the air stuck on top of a giant rib cage there's no bones to work around nothing inedible it could not be easier on the day of this is so much less stress than a conventional turkey dinner and the difference is even more dramatic on this dark meat normally the skin on the dark meat is soggy because it was down on the bottom submerged in juice this is so crisp and normally you can slice hardly any meat off of the leg because of those bony tendons every slice here is totally clean totally edible and cooked way hotter than the white meat which is the way that i think it's best you might want to let everybody know that they should go easy on the sauce it's way stronger than gravy and since the skin is so crispy it's nice that we don't have to wet it all down with sauce now i will tell you that i am not a fan of brined turkey meat a wet brine gives it the texture of cheap bologna a dry brine like we did here makes the texture a little too firm for me and i think the uniform saltiness provided by either one kind of drowns out the subtle flavor of turkey i prefer to have my sauce bring the salt and if i were to do this again i would do it the exact same way but i would not salt the turkey in advance maybe i'd salt the skin a little bit to help it dry but i'd season conventionally right before the oven that said maybe i'm crazy everybody else seems to love poultry brines so you do you and don't forget side dishes i've got a few linked in the description and if you follow this method you'll have a lot more time and brain space on the day of your feast to cook those side dishes or you can make your family cook them i mean you deboned a whole damn turkey haven't you done enough somebody give you a beer,3

Lauren and I had...,2022-12-01 14:47:05.183328, this video is an ad for one plus corn pudding is a classic thanksgiving side dish here in the southern united states is it a bread is it a cake is it a custard a casserole sure yeah all of those whatever it is it's good with gravy on it sometimes it's just a box of sweet cornbread mix and a can of creamed corn but since i don't feel like settling when it comes to my thanksgiving i've worked up a somewhat more decadent version you'll notice my wife lauren is giving you some behind-the-scenes shots today with our new phone from the sponsor of this video oneplus i'll be telling you about that as we go the oneplus 9 pro is a premium flagship android smartphone the company's whole philosophy is to never settle on anything which is why they've partnered with the legendary camera company hasselblad to capture amazing photos check out how nice these camera shots are so i'm slicing up one bunch of green onions about 100 grams corn pudding is generally sweet and i think onions help it to taste like not a dessert got a nice shot of your guns thank you dear the white and semi-white slices go in the mixing bowl i'll reserve the greens for later a couple fresh red chilies will also cut the sweetness and look real pretty on top thin round slices on those note the smooth motion of that oneplus camera lauren's got the super stable feature on if you don't want your pudding super spicy stop slicing when you get near the top of the chilies most of the capsaicin producing glands are up there if you can get a fresh ear of sweet corn it would be very nice to shuck that and slice off the kernels where i live we can get super sweet varieties into late fall if you can't no worries just drain a little can of sweet corn or use frozen corn i've got like a cup of whole kernels there 100 grams and half of them go in the bowl then it really wouldn't be corn pudding without two 15-ounce cans of creamed corn 850 grams total cream corn is disgusting i mean it's fine if you feel that way but the sweet starchy goo in these cans is a phenomenal binder and moistener in a cake or a casserole one more processed delight a 14 ounce 400 gram can of sweetened condensed milk that's not exactly traditional but milk and sugar are traditional and this is milk and sugar but better i'mma crack in four eggs that's really what makes this custardy some people would use even more i can't get over how that one plus camera moves smoother than my giant camera does with all its expensive stabilization hardware she's just holding it in her hands all right for dry ingredients i'm doing a cup of cornmeal 150 grams if you want your pudding less bready you can cut this in half i'm using a quarter cup 30 grams of cornstarch some recipes call for all-purpose flour instead i think that pushes the texture fully into the realm of cornbread the starch gets you a pudding texture two teaspoons of coarse salt maybe 10 grams to help balance the sugar to give my pudding a thanksgiving stuffing vibe i'm doing a teaspoon each of dried sage and dried thyme those are the stuffing herbs and then i'm doing a heaped tablespoon of baking powder for leavening maybe 12 grams last ingredient for the fat in the pudding you could use butter you could use oil what i have here is rendered turkey fat which i saved from a thing gross and uh we're gonna use that instead gross but delicious pretty much though melted butter would be traditional and very good as well about half a cup of fat 115 grams maybe which would be like a stick of butter and you might as well use whatever fat you're using to grease up the pan i've got a nine by 13 inch casserole here you could do this in a smaller pan if you wanted it thicker time to just stir this batter up until reasonably smooth it's as simple as that and in it goes in the pan it should look very loose if it's thicker than pancake batter you're gonna get cornbread not corn pudding and just because it's for a holiday dinner i'm being fancy and scattering my onion greens on top with my red chili slices and half of my fresh corn kernels very festive and it goes to an oven at 375 fahrenheit 190c for about a half hour which believe it or not is all the time it takes to charge this phone up full the oneplus 9 pro has the fastest charging solution in north america 1 to 100 in 29 minutes oh check out lauren doing phone selfies the pudding is done when it's a little brown on top and it looks and feels barely solid it should not be as dry on the inside as bread or cake would be what i like about this corn pudding is that it's an all-in-one thanksgiving side you could have this and no other sides it's your bread it's your stuffing it's your vegetables it's sweet like a sweet potato side and it's great with gravy on top or in this case some turkey demi-gloss that i made i'm not a fan of gratuitous sauce drizzling shots but the slo-mo function on this oneplus camera just had to be tried smash that subscribe button if you want to learn how to make that demi-glass i'm posting that recipe in a couple of days and check out the oneplus 9 pro a flagship android phone with a very powerful hasselblad camera check out the portrait mode for those sexy blurry background effects and check out that zoom it's like a microscope oneplus says you should never settle not on your phone not on your thanksgiving they've got a whole site with other side dish recipes linked in the description thanks to oneplus for their sponsorship and have a sweet and savory holiday maybe a little spicy too,3

squarespace a small but substantial percentage of covid19 patients are experiencing long-term problems with their sense of smell or taste food tastes really bad or it doesn't taste like anything at all and it doesn't seem to be getting better that's the bad news as of this november 2021 update the good news is most people who experience these taste and smell symptoms do get better and for everybody else there do seem to be some promising treatments on the horizon some that are surprisingly simple we're using vitamin a drops in the nose to try and regenerate the smell receptors the doc does not suggest trying that one on your own but we are going to talk about some simple things you can try of people diagnosed with coven 19 maybe half seem to be experiencing some loss of smell or taste of those people about 10 percent are having persistent problems everybody else goes back to normal after about a month these numbers are real shaky for reasons that we'll get to but you figure ten percent of fifty percent that means five percent of people diagnosed with coven 19 are getting long-term problems with taste and smell remember that flavor is the combination of those distinct senses along with a few other things like the heat of chili one of the reasons scientists take these numbers with a grain of salt is that people are often not able to tell the difference between smell and taste and other chemosensory stuff that we experience when we're eating so we really aren't really sure which part of us isn't working right also these taste and smell problems seem to be affecting different parts of the world differently keep in mind that a map like this reflects where the studies are being done more so than it reflects where the problems are happening so less developed countries are massively underrepresented but that study and this more recent one find that western covid19 patients they are maybe twice as likely to experience taste or smell problems than their counterparts in east asia it's not nearly as big a problem in the east that could be a geographic thing reflecting the virology of the particular strains and the variants in different parts of the world this study finds ethnicity to be a factor that much alone suggests there's a difference in how the virus attacks different groups of people in this respect and how exactly does the sars cove ii virus attack all of this and therefore our experience of food and drink well we still don't really know but we don't think the virus infects the smell receptors directly like other viruses have done in the past we've gone back to our friend dr carl philpott professor of rhinology and olfactology at the university of east anglia as a researcher and as a physician dr philpott has been up to his elbows in this problem since the pandemic started and he's still seeing tons of covid patients at his clinic anyway he was saying they don't think kovid affects the smell receptors directly and that's because the the spike protein on the surface of the virus appears to be accessing cells via something called an ace receptor and that receptor probably exists only on the the cells that sit around the smell receptors in the top of the nose so it's probably having an indirect impact by infecting those cells around it and then and then affecting the the cell layer in general and causing either some sort of sort of distortion or disruption of nutrient supply or blood flow uh to the smell receptors themselves whatever happens the smell is obviously getting knocked out because they're not working properly and people are losing a sense of smell and of course this is all distinct from the normal smell or taste loss we get when we get a cold or a flu or something like that that's generally caused by congestion it's like pitching your nose air just can't get up there and so you don't smell things right this is different with kovid it tends to come on really really fast all at once and often before any other symptoms but a lot of time has passed since we first talked to dr philpot at the beginning of the pandemic that video is linked in the description now we have a lot more people recovering and that may be in a way leading to the rise of a different symptom called parasmea or smell distortion dr philpott says he's seeing lots of people in the clinic who are recovering from covid19 they've regained smell or taste but they're still not smelling or tasting right everything is wrong they smell delicious food and it smells like rotting fish or something like that philpott thinks this might be an indication of a partial recovery some of their smell receptors have come back online but other ones haven't so for example the smell of a rose has put about 13 different molecules and if you can only pick out 6 out of 13 you get a distorted signal obviously the more closer you get to the kind of 13 to get to 10 you might kind of recognize that that pretty much smells like a rose but it's not quite the smell of rose i remember before but it's enough of a recognition to get that sort of sense of what it is so that's the sort of you know what tends to be happening with people is getting this kind of slow kind of a partial recovery and then again this distortion there's also research indicating that taste is affected by covid true taste as they say those simple sweet salty bitter type sensations that we get on our tongue experts have hypothesized that taste disruption might be an indication of the virus attacking deeper in our nervous system into our brains there is obviously a theory that if it was invading more centrally it might disrupt true taste as much as smell however there is also suggestion that the some of the taste receptors perhaps are vulnerable to attack by the virus directly as well so perhaps if there is true taste disturbance it's um just down to a local problem rather than a central problem again they don't really know and they don't claim to another problem is that it's it's hard to gather data about taste and smell issues on patients who are really sick with covid because if you can't breathe you're not going to be complaining to your doctor about how dinner tastes weird right also people with these symptoms are likely to be very infectious and so scientists aren't really excited about getting up close to them to test objectively whether it is a smell or a taste problem for example the true objective tests come in when you do things like um mri scans where there's a smell present that's called functional mri they put you in the machine and they look inside you and they see what lights up when you smell something for our trial they're about to start we'll actually be doing functional mri for participants before and after the drops that they receive and that's the trial where they're going to be putting vitamin a at people's noses a previous trial in germany found that to be effective retinoic acid which is the key ingredient in the vitamin a is thought to help with the dna repair process in cells so the idea is it's helping those smell receptors to kind of turn over and start to regenerate again i guess as i'm saying you're thinking about this if i put that on youtube people are going to go out and buy vitamin a capsules and oil inside their nose and is that a terrible idea or it may be is that worth a shot uh well they should probably do on the direction of uh a specialist at this stage until we've done this trial because obviously we don't we don't yet know sort of you know we want to do the trial to get some sort of better evidence around it so yeah what you can do yourself is smell training there's a link in the description to fifth sense this is a uk-based charity dr philpott works with go to support and resources and look for smell ability that's the name of the program smell ability there's a procedure here for smell training with stuff that you have around your house you can do that but the procedure that has been most studied is using essential oils specifically lemon rose clove and eucalyptus i got something like those for in this pack they sold at the grocery store it's not quite the same thing but those four are just the most studied smells not necessarily the most effective smells these are probably fine and then ideally it's not quite as simple as smelling the open bottles there's a whole thing where you put some drops into jars and use an inhaler stick but the procedure is linked in the description read all about it you literally just smell different strong smells twice a day every day for weeks and in theory it's kind of like physical therapy to repair a muscle or retrain a muscle get your brain to re-establish new connections through your nervous system you stimulate your nervous system into regenerating its abilities you may have seen some viral tick-tock where people try burning citrus fruits and stuff like that and they say that brings back their sense of smell or taste well in practice that may be a less studied less systematic form of smell training i've just actually received the reports from a study that i was involved with for smell training which does seem suggest a benefit but the numbers in the study were quite small so uh we're looking to do some more work around that and there are a number of studies around around the world this of looking to provide more evidence on that um the evidence for you know pre-code for other viruses for smell training was was generally pretty good um not to say work for everybody but it's something that you can try and at the very least smelling things every single day would allow you to track your symptoms over time in a way that could be really useful information for you or your doctor simple easy things can be really effective and now is normally when i would make a super smooth transition to talking about squarespace the sponsor of this video feels a little weird to do that in the context of talking about something so serious but i think this video provided people with really useful information it's important stuff and quality content has to be paid for by someone i'm super glad that squarespace has chosen to sponsor my channel and therefore here we are talking about squarespace a website from squarespace can help you sell your content

***RECIPE,...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.183328," Here's an easy beef braise for a rainy day
that tastes a little of the sun. It's flavored with orange and lime, and you could thicken
the sauce with starch but I thickened this with egg yolk. The result tastes like a beefy
hollandaise, which I suppose it literally is. Here's a 3 pound beef chuck roast, 1.36 kilos.
It'll feed 4 to 6 people in this meal. And I always look for the ones with lots of intramuscular
fat, like those little flecks there. Those taste insanely great in a braised hunk of
beef. The inter-muscular fat, however, I will trim
out — the thick bands of fat between the muscle groups. I do not plan to de-fat this
sauce later, so now is my chance to limit the final grease content. I'll cut this into
big chunks as I go. They will shrink in half or more by the time we're done cooking them,
so if you want big hearty chunks, you gotta start really big. 16 big pieces, 3 or 4 to each person should
be plenty with all the sides. Chrissy Teigen pan, activate! You'll want something with
a lid. A little olive oil to get this started on pretty high heat and I'll brown this beef
in two batches. If you put too much in, a ton of water will collect in the pan and you'll
have to boil it out before you can brown anything. If these chunks really stick on you when you
do this, it really doesn't matter. Just scrape them off. If they get torn up a bit, who cares?
They're gonna be covered in sauce, and we're not really flavoring the pieces. We're flavoring
the whole dish, so if the brown is on the piece or at the bottom of the pan, it really
makes no difference. Next batch in, and honestly one way to keep
them from sticking if you do care is to keep them moving for the first couple minutes.
When I have a moment of down time, I will cut an onion in half, peel and slice it into
wedges rather than chopping it. I'm gonna leave these in the finished sauce, and when
I do that I like to have bigger pieces. They're gonna cook down a ton. That beef is plenty brown enough. I have been
overzealous about my browning many times in the past. You hit a point of diminishing returns
and then you really risk created burned flavors that you cannot get out. That much is fine. Before all that burns, get in the onions and
move them around lot. We don't need to cook them all the way — just get some nice brown
flavor on them before the liquid goes in. Again, when I have a moment of down time I
will crush and peel some garlic cloves. And today I think I'm gonna throw them in whole.
They'll get real soft and mild in the braise. I can see I'm close to burning the fond at
the bottom there, so time to squeeze in a little tomato paste. Very nice for flavor
and color. Stir and brown that for just a sec. And see? I'm in imminent danger of burning
in that lower left quadrant so in goes like two cups of water, 475 mL. Scrape the bottom
a little bit, but honestly anything on the bottom is gonna dissolve by itself in time. Beef goes in, along with any accumulated juice.
And then I'm gonna do the zest and juice of an orange. It's much easier to zest before
you juice. Way more flavor in that stuff than in the actual juice, but I want both. And
I'm just catching any seeds in my hand there but it's really no big deal if they go in. I might want a second orange, but I'll be
conservative for now. A couple pinches of salt to start with and plenty of pepper. And
one more flavoring — a New Mexico chili. You could skip this, or use two or three.
I love whole dried chilies for the musky, almost like raisin-y flavor they give stews,
and this variety brings hardly and heat at all. Bring this up to a boil, then reduce to a
simmer, cover and cook for like four or five hours until soft. Not a weeknight meal. For
that, I turn to the sponsor of this video, HelloFresh, America's #1 meal kit. With fall in the air, it's nice that HelloFresh
recipes are seasonal. These will be very great to cozy up to. Fall is also my busiest time
of year, work-wise, and so it's very helpful that every few nights I just open up a bag,
I follow someone else's directions and in like a half hour I've got dinner. It's less
time than a typical trip to the grocery store. And since everything comes pre-portioned,
there's no waste, there's no bits and bobs leftover that I have to figure out how to
use. And I think these recipes are very clever. This sauce is based on a little packet of
jam, which works great. The sweetness is balanced by all the ginger. And this recipe has one
other clever trick that I will steal before this video is over. In the meantime, go to

want to make sure you're in no danger of the water all evaporating out because if that
happens that would be bad. Everything would burn. But this is fine. Tons of water coming
out of the onion and the beef. I'll taste it, and yeah, I think I want a second orange
in there, zest and juice. You just gotta be careful when cooking with
fruit juice. Things can get way too sweet really fast. But this is gonna be fine with
two oranges. Cover up and simmer for a couple more hours. And now you can see I could pull
this beef apart if I wanted too, so we're pretty much done. Leave yourself some extra
time, though. Every cut of meat is different, some need more time than others to go soft. I am gonna leave that simmering uncovered
for a bit, just to reduce down the sauce a little. I still have to prep my sides. I pretty
much always want carrots with braised beef. This a 1 pound bag that I'm peeling. I think
you'd want twice that if you were gonna eat all of this at once. We're only gonna eat
half tonight. I'm gonna freeze the rest for later, so 454g of carrots it is, and I'm cutting
them into centimeter-thick slices at an attractive angle. You could totally just throw these in with
the beef for the last hour of cooking and that'd be fine, but I really liked those roasted
carrots I had the other night, so I'm throwing them on a baking sheet with a little oil,
pepper and salt. Toss those around, and in they go at like 400ºF, 200ºC, and they should
take 20 minutes. I'll also get some water boiling for egg noodles.
A little salt in there, and Manischewitz makes the best ones, #NotAnAd. Just half of the
one bag, again, because I'm only eating half of my beef tonight. I'll give those carrots
a stir — get them recoated in the hot oil. That helps them brown better. I've got a lime
here that I'm going to zest for the carrots. Beef chunks come out, and I'm already gonna
have to wash this lid so I might as well use it for this. Another advantage of braising
beef in huge chunks is that they're easier to pick out of the sauce. Why would you want
to pick them out of the sauce? Well, if you wanted to be fancy, you could
strain this and dump the solids. I'm gonna fish out the chili and get rid of that, but
I actually want to eat everything in there tonight, so no straining. Give that a taste.
It needs more salt, and I think it could use a little brightening. Could use vinegar, or
I could use this lime I already have. It goes with the citrus theme, and just half should
probably do it. Just as I have no moral hesitation about adding
acid when something isn't acidic enough, I will not hesitate to add sugar when something
isn't sweet enough. A little pinch will be real nice. You'd also need to take the beef out to put
this in a gravy separator or something and pour off the fat. But because we trimmed the
beef, there's really not that much fat floating on top and I'm gonna emulsify it right back
in with an egg yolk. My heat is off, there's no bubbling at all,
so I'm safe to put this in and stir briskly. Heat back on. If the beef was still in here,
I would be tearing it to shreds right now, by the way. The yolk will come to its full
thickening power when you hit a simmer and then you can assess if you need another one.
I think I do. I want this real thick, though I gotta remember it's gonna thicken more as
it cools. I'll turn my heat off before I put the next one in. Egg yolk is a terrific thickener. Very common
in Cajun and Creole cuisine. It has more emulsifying power than butter, and all the protein in
there will also serve to thicken the sauce. You just gotta be careful to only simmer it.
Don't boil it. If it gets too hot it'll go grainy and the emulsion will break, it'll
be real bad. Once it's cooked I'll cool it down for a sec
to assess the texture at eating temperature. That might even be too thick, but I can always
stir in some water later. Give it a taste. Oh man, that custardy flavor you get from
the yolk is outrageous. Beef in. Very carefully. It's super soft, and unless you want shredded
beef, you gotta handle it with kid gloves at this stage. Just get it coated and reheated,
and yeah I think it needs a little more water. I think I'll do a little fresh thyme in there.
Thyme goes great with citrus, hence lemon thyme. Carrots are done, and yeah, here's
the idea I'm steeling. Toss lime zest through the hot carrots. Phenomenal flavor combination. Drain the egg noodles. You can always toss
in a little butter or oil if you're not ready to eat them right away. That'll keep them
from sticking together. But I'm ready to eat. Once thing you're gonna
you'll notice is this isn't the most attractive sauce you've ever seen. It would be prettier
if we had strained the braising liquid, but still the egg yolks give it a kinda gloopy
look. Who cares. I'll give myself a little bunch of cilantro, and for your thumbnail
you'll want to put a wedge of orange on top. I'm sure that's something you worry about
as much as I do. If you have leftovers, just be sure to reheat
them real gently so you don't overcook the egg. With the citrus, that really tastes like
a meaty hollandaise sauce on this buttery-soft beef. Like I said, a rainy-day meal that tastes
of the sun. Really hit the spot.",3

The Part I vid,...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.183328, hey what even are hops is a hops actually no it turns out the singular is hop one hop many hops so that's one mystery down but how this bitter little pinecone thingy ended up as the most popular extra flavoring agent for beer well that's what we'll explore now in the second half of our chemistry of beer series part 1 is in the description where we left off the power of enzymes had converted grain into a sweet golden juicy drink known as wart that bee must have really wanted a taste after filtering the brewer boils the wort for about an hour to shut down those enzymatic processes and to sterilize the warts to clarify it maybe concentrate it a bit and you could just ferment that plain wart and call it a day but historically people didn't really like the result it was a little bland a little too sweet as we discussed last time roasting malts for beer in particular roasting it really dark like they did for this beer well that converts some of the malt into sugars that yeast cannot eat non-fermentable sugars so they survive all the way to the finished beer and you taste them on your tongue they taste sweet in medieval europe they would bring their wort to a boil and then drop in some gruet to balance the sweetness gruit was a term kind of similar to masala in indian cooking it's a category encompassing endless combinations of herbs and spices but almost always including a few common core ingredients a typical gruit would include mugwort whorehound yarrow and other weeds with delightfully unappealing anglo-saxon names i reckon the reason that most of us haven't heard of any of those is that most of them are real bitter and generally speaking we don't like to make our food bitter drinks are a different thing though right there's lots of really popular bitter drinks coffee bitter teas and you've got your bitter drinking chocolates and all kinds of bitter cocktails if you really do or really don't like bitter drinks there are several studies pointing to a genetic explanation for that we should talk about that more another day but the point is there's a long history of adding bittering agents to balance the sweet taste of beer or ale as it would have been called in middle and early modern english a little brew like this flavored with gruet was called ale in this oft-cited history of the english brewing industry economic historian peter matthias reports that the 15th century english used the word beer to describe something different a new brew imported from the present-day netherlands and belgium the low countries where they had started using hops instead of gruet there may have been an economic incentive for this local authorities in germany and the low countries used to tax grew it or establish monopolies on the sale of gruet this was a way for them to tax and control the sale of beer without actually taxing and controlling the sale of beer so perhaps to save money brewers turned instead to the bitter cones from a vine indigenous to temperate zones across eurasia also indigenous to here in the americas too dr nathan duncan grows hops on the side of his house near the campus of maryville college where he teaches a chemistry of beer course it's not really a cone like a pine cone but we do call them hop cones because they really do look like a pine cone but these are the flowers of the female hot plants this variety is one called comet some varieties are prized for their bittering capacity others more for delicate herbal or citrusy notes that they can bring and while some hops do taste kind of like pine this plant is not related to coniferous trees what it's really closely related to is cannabis and that's why cannabis can have really similar sensory qualities to hoppy beer hops and cannabis contain a lot of very similar compounds let's look at the anatomy of a hop really that that'll help explain this i'm going to cut one of these open down the center yes dr duncan's basement man cave is exactly what you'd expect him to have down there but anyway science if you look in the middle of here there's all these little yellow specks and especially when you look close up you'll be able to see them really well those are coming from what are called the lupulin glands of the hop cone that right there that yellow stuff is the hop oils the hop resins that it's extremely bitter but it also contains most of the compounds that we're trying to extract from the hops what does a fresh hop taste like citrusy herbal very nice actually at first whoa there's the bitterness yep yep that's about to say that's not so bad and then i was waiting for it yeah the chief bitter components in there are known as alpha acids or humulones and while they are plenty bitter if you were to just sit down to a fresh hop salad which is not a thing that anyone does that bitterness would probably get diluted beyond recognition inside a giant keg of beer so nearly every beer style on earth includes a 60-minute hop addition 60 or more those hops have been dried and palletized for storage less surface area means less oxidation the brewer brings the wort to a boil drops in some hops and lets them boil in there for at least an hour the boiling will change those alpha acids they undergo a reaction that's called an isomerization reaction where essentially they're they have a ring in their chemical structure that has six units in it so it's a hexagon and in the boiling process it isomerizes to a five-membered ring but there's other chemical changes that go in there the alpha acid itself is not extremely bitter but the isomerized alpha acid is so these are the bittering hops dr duncan has in there now the 60 minute hops and in the case of the dark scottish ale he's working on that's all the hops it's gonna get he's pulling out the hop spider a porous container that goes in the brew kettle the hops are in there and they are spent with a scottish ale you're supposed to taste the malt more so than the hops you just need a little bitter to balance the sweet this other beer is an india pale ale and ipas are all about the hops why well when brewers switched from gruet to hops they noticed that the hops functioned as a preservative in there they weren't getting these weird ropey bits of mold growing through the beer after a while they weren't getting bacteria floating in there and turning it sour after a while bacteria that create acetic acid or lactic acid that wasn't happening the way that it would happen when they used grew it by adding an enormous amount of hops to the beer at multiple different stages you get a large proportion of these naturally antimicrobial antibacterial compounds in there and your beer lasts for longer and so they would brew it in england and with that amount of hops added to the to the casks they could survive the trip from england around to india to the english troops in the east indies hence the india pale ale or the even hoppier imperial ipa and while that contribution to colonialism may be a dubious distinction i am nonetheless grateful to hops for keeping my beer safe just as my safety online is enhanced by surf shark the sponsor of this video some people make overblown claims about vpns one reason i work with surf shark is i don't think they do that here's what a virtual private network is really good for

minute hops addition to bitter the beer 45 minutes into the boiling he is late hopping why well in addition to those bitter acids in the hops you also have terrapins terrapins are a class of hydrocarbons or oils made by plants when they talk about essential oils and things like citrus fruits a big component of what they're talking about there is terrapins terrapins smell real good at least some of them do the most famous or most common when you think of terpene most people think turpentine turpentine is a terpene oil from pine trees the compound in there is alpha pinene which is found in some hops which gives it that piney flavor but terpenes in general are 10 carbon organic compounds and they possess a lot of interesting properties they tend to be the reason that we use herbs and spices in cooking like they're where the flavors come from so when you use vanilla you're using vanillin which is a 10 carbon terpene when you're using mint you're getting menthol 10 carbon terpene when you're using spearmint you you're using one form of carbon or if you're using a caraway seed you're using another form of carbon which are both terpenes the terrapins are chiefly what give hoppy beers their floral or fruity or piney or citrusy aromas the problem is they are very volatile the terpenes they extract quickly but if you noticed when we added that 60 minute within a few minutes like almost instantly you started smelling hops and if you stood around by the scottish shell that we only added a 60 minute addition to by the end of it you weren't smelling a lot of the hop terpenes anymore the steam was carrying them away so brewers may add more hops 20 minutes before they're done boiling five minutes before they're done boiling zero minutes before they're done boiling like after they've turned the heat off that's very common each of those late additions will deposit and retain different terrapins depending on their particular molecular weight and volatility which ones boil away when and that's where we are now with these warts minute zero and beyond dr duncan is cooling them down by pumping cool water through that copper coil the heat of the wort transfers through the metal into the water the water takes that heat with it when it leaves here like on this side where it's coming straight out of it it's like cold to the touch and over here it's just too hot to even handle the wart is also too hot for the yeast to handle you'll kill them if you put them in now hence why the wart needs to cool and to cool quickly before any other microbes get in there and set up shop likewise that's why he is sterilizing all his instruments over here the beer will never be boiled again so now he has to work real clean to keep out any buggies that might out compete the yeast or make the beer taste sour or funky he siphons the wort down into a fermenter and then it's time to pitch the yeast pitch the yeast sounds a lot cooler than put the yeast in but that's all it means just put the yeast in also all this yeast is is saccharomyces cerviceae the same yeast that we use to make bread with these are just different strains of the same species in the same way that you and i are the same species we come from different families and therefore we have different genetic lineages that manifest in our traits same species different families for example this strain tends to make a lot of co2 when it eats sugar and that's good for rising bread this strain tends to make a lot of alcohol when it eats sugar which is good for beer but they both make both and of course human beings have been breeding yeast selectively for centuries in order to get strains that have different qualities they like for different purposes like this one for brewing beer so the yeast is in on goes the lid and the airlock bubbler this will allow co2 to escape during fermentation so the barrel doesn't explode but it's going to prevent unwanted wild yeast bacteria mold from getting in because i'm going to fill it up with my sanitizer that sanitizer is food safe by the way you could drink it and that's it depending on the strain of yeast you're using and how sugary your wart is and all that it could be beer in as little as a week though two weeks is more common at least more common for ale style beers like the one that we've been making here remember in the renaissance they used ale to refer to brews that had been flavored with gruet and they used beer to refer to brews that had been flavored with hops now basically all beer is made with hops so we call it all beer the word ale now refers to something else that's a little bit more particular ale refers to beer that has been brewed with saccharomyces cerevisiae which generally like to do their thing around room temperature you can instead make a lager-style beer like this one in dr duncan's lab the coil is there to keep it cold for these you generally use a different species called saccharomyces pastorianus named after louis pasteur they ferment at colder temperatures they take a little longer like a month and the beer you get from them is much more light and crisp and clear some recent research indicates that they might have independently invented lager beer here in the americas in south america like a thousand years ago but in the european context lager beer was probably invented by these bavarian monks who were storing their beer in these cold alpine caves during the summer and they discovered that they could get a fermentation down there in the cold that resulted in different effects most big name beers in the united states are loggers reflecting the influence of german immigrants in the american midwest where these companies were founded and also the fact that loggers are maybe more crowd pleasing they're not quite as intense as ales but whether it's an ale or a lager you can do what dr duncan is doing right now which is called dry hopping even though it's not dry that's a bag of hops that he's got there this mesh bag will allow beer to get in there allow compounds to dissolve out but we'll keep most of the little like nasty green hot particles that will clog the beer lines and also that frankly would be very very bitter out of the beer so this is gonna this is gonna remove mostly the terpenes but it's gonna leave most of the um most of the bittering compounds behind another thing that happens during the fermentation is that yeast metabolize some of the terrapins terrapins are hydrocarbons they're energy stores and yeast will metabolize terrapins into other things that taste different and they'll make terrapins themselves too that's the bio conversion that we heard about in part one this is actually the main focus of dr duncan's research lab over at maryville college the doc and his students are brewing lots of slightly different versions of beers they're trying to isolate how little variables affect the terrapins and therefore change the flavor and other qualities of the beer this lager that i'm tasting is the cousin of an ipa i tasted over in the man cave this one is the same grain same hops but different yeast and they're trying to see how and why those yeast affect the terrapins tastes real good to me real citrusy but it is flat so yuck there remains one final very important step to brewing that we've not yet discussed and that is carbonation actually we could put carbonation under the heading of conditioning when the yeast have fermented all the sugar they can or when the alcohol content in there gets too high for them they shut down they go dormant and they flocculate so flocculation is the process of yeast settling out of solution so they're single-celled organisms they actually when they start to sense that there's less food around they form little colonies and clumps and they fall out now if you took this flocculated yeast and dried it you'd have uh powdered yeast like you get for you know a packet of active dry yeast or brewer's yeast dr duncan is using a siphon to draw the beer up and away from all of that flocculated yeast on the bottom the yeast have been fruitful and multiplied in there there's way more yeast left over at the end of a brewing than you would need in order to brew your next batch so historically breweries sold their yeast to bakers nowadays they sell their yeast to all kinds of people including bakers still i'm sure but also for the purposes of making yeast extracts like marmite or vegemite which is a thing we should talk about another day once the flat beer has been transferred to bottles or in this case a keg now you can make it fizzy add more sugar to it let it ferment in the keg and the keg is sealed so it'll just build up the pressure and we do that by carefully measuring the sugar brewers use all kinds of priming sugars for this purpose could just be table sugar could be malt sugar historically it might have been honey or even fruit all kinds of things and you just need a little bit of it a little bit of that and a little bit of yeast left in here and if there's not enough yeast in here you might have to pitch a little bit more for the bottle conditioning phase that we're in now you need a secondary fermentation to occur only this time it's going to happen while the beer is under pressure and that pressure will force that co2 into solution it will dissolve into the water only to emerge later as teeny little bubbles when we finally crack this open if you don't have enough sugar or enough viable yeast your beer will be flat what happens if you have too much in the sealed bottle you end up waking up in the middle of the night to what sounds like gunfire because you have hand grenades in your in your basement going off because your bottles are over carbonated other chemical things also happen in this bottle over the course of the conditioning period that make it taste better when it finally comes out conditioning period generally takes at least two weeks agonizing weeks i'm sure when shell-shocked brewers just jump at the slightest bump that they hear in the house for fear that something terrible is going on downstairs you'll understand why probably most beer these days is not carbonated naturally the other way that we can do which is the way that i generally prefer is to take this beer and just connect it to a co2 tank and force carbonate it and the reason why i like that is if we do more fermentation the yeast there is still a little bit of yeast in solution that will start to propagate and we'll get another layer of yeast sediment in this in this keg you know that'll come out with the first beer that we pour but but not even that will necessarily keep you safe during the conditioning period say you weren't real careful with sanitizing your bottles or your keg yeast cannot metabolize starch this we know that's why we had to convert starch in the grain into sugar but there's still a lot of unconverted starch in here that's what most of the calories in beer are unconverted starch we can metabolize starch you know who else can certain kinds of bacteria that might be in here if you didn't do a good job sterilizing you know some people call those gusher bacteria because when you open them those beer bottles are gushers and i had one that i just barely pried the top off of it and it shot off with such force that it knocked the bottle opener out of my hand and the in the bottle cap hit the ceiling and it was just like a bottle it was like a champagne fountain and i had just opened it so you know get into brewing at your own risk but ah the rewards this is the ipa that we brewed outside and here's the scottish ale what's that smell pete yeah smells like a dumpster fire yep yeah real smoky from that peated malt and here's where we shall leave things eagle-eyed viewers to the part 1 video noticed that this beer is called pearson's dumpster fire so named by the maryville college students who wrote the recipe really the full name of it is the great pearsons dumpster fire of 2019. this building over here that's pearson's hall the cafeteria is in there and one day during beer class the dumpster kinda sorta caught on fire it happens so they wanted to make a smoky beer and we said well what are you gonna name it and they said well let's name it the pearson's dumpster fire because it still smelled like smoke from when the dumpster had accidentally caught on fire earlier that day well at least the kids over there are learning some real world skills right beer and civilization were born together so as long as we're together i reckon there will always be a market for delicious beer,3

***RECIPE,...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.183328, because cream of mushroom soup is so popular as a canned good it kind of has a low-class reputation but i love the stuff so what i've tried to do here is make high-class cream of mushroom soup it's a bit more expensive and more finicky than my typical soup recipes but it's honestly the best thing i've had to eat in a while it's very strong very delicious if you really like mushrooms and i do but the first thing is an onion peeled and roughly chopped it's going to get pureed so it doesn't have to be pretty at this stage pot on reasonably high heat some olive oil in there and i'm just going to stir this until it's soft and starting to brown you'll notice i'm using my chrissy teigen pan not a soup pot this is going to go a lot faster if i cook it in a wide vessel a narrow soup pot just doesn't have as much hot pan surface area after about seven minutes in the pan that's good enough in goes a couple tablespoons of butter you could just use more olive oil instead an amount roughly equal in weight to this quarter cup of all-purpose flour that i'm stirring in to make a roux about 30 grams of flour if you have enough fat in there you can stir it into a thick paste it might look too dry until you cook it for a minute a roux will loosen up when it really gets going and i'll just gently brown that for a few minutes just for flavor before it burns we'll need something to deglaze the pan a wise man once said i've got my cavazier right here actually it's hennessy any cognac any brandy would be fine or whiskey any liquor aged in a wooden barrel goes amazing with mushrooms in my opinion it's like tasting the essence of the forest the tree and the fungus that grows through it i probably put in a whole cup of cognac 240 mils but we obviously need a little more liquid so i'm just slowly mixing in about two cups of plain water if you put it in all at once it'll be hard to stir out the lumps i used plain water instead of stock because this is going to be my stock dried mushrooms any kind i'd say buy one of the cheaper varieties these are my takis and i try to snap apart the biggest chunks as i drop them in this recipe will have fresh mushrooms but the flavor base is dried mushrooms an ounce total 30 grams each of these packages is half an ounce dried mushrooms are a far more potent source of umami and shroomy flavors than fresh mushrooms are but some people are bothered by the tiny grains of sand that are often stuck in them you'd have to look real close to these porcini to see anything oh you noticed the green

shipping label drop it in the mail and that's it order the winning pair online do your free at home try on just go to warbyparker.com regucia it helps me when use my link which is in the description thank you warby parker and if a little sandy grit on dried mushrooms bothers you here's how you deal with it bring some water to a boil the microwave is fine take it off the heat stir in the mushrooms they rapidly start to grow which opens their structure and helps release any sand let it sit for maybe a half hour and you've got what they call mushroom tea the liquid from the first steep usually contains most of the flavor from the mushrooms to keep out the sand you can just throw a coffee filter into a strainer and pour the tea through keep the mushrooms behind the sand is so small it would go through the sieve without the coffee filter in there that is a huge amount of flavor we just put into the soup then you can just throw the mushrooms in but the package tells you to give them a wash in case any sand is still sticking truthfully i almost never bother with any of that the sand doesn't bother me and rarely have i even noticed it i just throw them in dry you do you so i've got an ounce 30 grams total of dried mushrooms and 4 cups total of water almost a liter i like at least a couple tablespoons of worcestershire sauce in here yes it's made with anchovies you could use soy sauce instead or a yeast extract like marmite or just skip it i'll grind in some pepper to start with the worcestershire sauce brought enough salt for now and at this point i'll just cover this so not too much evaporates and simmer on low heat for at least a half hour an hour would be better during which time i can work on my pound of fresh mushrooms about half a kilo whatever kind you can get these are cremini these are baby shiitake and i've got a few big chanterelles in there i'll just give everything a quick rinse to get off any big chunks of dirt still on them time to trim off any woody bits of the stem and slice thinly i think thin slices are better in something as delicate as a soup these cute little shiitake i might just cut in half i want to see the identifiable shape of mushrooms in the finished soup this might look like a gargantuan pile but it's really the minimum you need they're going to shrink down considerably here in my widest pan i've got a mixture of hot olive oil and butter in there i like that combination with mushrooms but whatever fat you use use a lot of it i'll put in a pinch of salt and some pepper to start with i think you really do taste the seasoning the mushrooms absorb in the saute it doesn't all get dissolved in the soup later the wider the pan the quicker this goes i need to boil most of the water out of them before i can really start browning them while i wait i can peel and chop a few garlic cloves that i'll put in with the mushrooms right at the end we're getting there now cooking these down also concentrates their flavor i think that when you make soup things need to be very strongly flavored because they're going to be diluted by a lot of water in the end and now that these are dry enough they'll start getting really golden brown almost done so in goes the garlic and i'll fry that for a couple of minutes until i see the little pieces just starting to go golden there's some good brown stuff stuck to the bottom of that pan we can deglaze might as well use the same brandy as before derpy derp de derp hello i forgot that'll happen on a gas stove i'm used to electric with gas you gotta turn the heat off vapors or droplets from high proof spirits can escape and ignite on the open flame but no harm done this is perfect heat off here's my suit base after about an hour and honestly you could just throw the fresh mushrooms in with the rehydrated ones right now and call it a day but the dried ones are still a little leathery and i think we can get even more flavor out of them by pureeing this as smooth as possible a food processor or a carafe style blender would probably do a better job but i just think the stick blender is easier to get out of the cupboard and it's easier to clean plenty smooth that is and you could eat it just like that totally or if you're feeling extra fancy you could pass it through a fine sieve this will get us a silky smooth texture in the end just grind around on the fibers with a wooden spoon and you'll have surprisingly little waste in the end i'll rinse that pan out real quick before we pour this back in i generally hate pureed soups because every bite is exactly the same that's what the sliced fresh mushrooms are for heterogeneity they're safe to go in now and it's time for the eponymous cream in the cream of mushroom soup if you don't want dairy use coconut cream instead i might pour in as much as a cup 240 mls by the end but i'll be conservative up front stir that in and have a taste needs a bunch more salt and some fresh pepper right here at the end and now you just boil this for a few minutes until the cream thickens up a bit boil it gently if the cream gets way too hot it can kind of curdle in there maybe i want a little more cream what i don't need is any more acid because i've used a lot of brandy and that stuff is surprisingly acidic when you concentrate it if you had to skip the brandy and you couldn't use white wine or anything instead i'd put in a splash of vinegar at this stage apple cider vinegar be particularly nice you don't need much it certainly won't be enough to curdle the cream we are done that's probably enough soup for four or five dinner size portions twice that as a side or an appetizer for pretty you could drizzle a little more cream on top for company it might be nice to give them an assortment of fresh herbs they can stir in at the table whatever they'd like i think this tarragon goes very well with mushrooms it's a licorice flavor and it sure looks pretty some whole young parsley leaves instead would look awful nice too and i think my favorite herb for this is time i always think fresh thyme tastes kind of like the ground in a good way it's mossy thyme with the mushrooms and the brandy aged in wood it really is like eating the forest that broth has a very powerful mushroom flavor from the dried mushrooms you can drag some garlic toast through that if you want you can freeze any leftovers just reheat it gently to keep the cream from splitting but if you love mushrooms as much as i do leftovers will not be a thing,3
Why we cook food in oil,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ktVSavCov9Y/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLDk5BRfsvC51iph3bSg0KaYO4T0cQ,ktVSavCov9Y,"12 minutes, 25 seconds","Thanks to Audible for sponsoring this video!

free: http://audible.com/adamragusea or text...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.183328, this video is sponsored by audible why does nearly every recipe start with dropping a film of oil into a pan ever wonder what had happened if you just didn't hey let's find out actually first let's do it the normal way just for the sake of comparison a little olive oil in a hot pan sprouts in and almost immediately you start to see this nice golden color emerging generations of people raised on boiled brussels sprouts grew to hate them and that's understandable you gotta brown them they're filled with starches and sugars and proteins that brown up real nice if you give them enough time and enough heat these took six minutes to get very brown and tender and quite tasty if i do say so myself now let's try to do the exact same thing again but with no oil are they going to stick to the pan without any oil in there not really not if you keep them moving here's our first bit of browning and check out how different that looks it's a patch of black with really clearly defined borders very different from the broad smudge of golden brown we got with oil there's a few little brown spots showing up on the cut sides but much smaller and more localized than the overall browning we got with oil and one other thing i noticed is that they're cooking very very slowly we're at six minutes now which is how long it took to cook the previous batch all the way through and these are still hard on the inside nowhere close to being tender after 11 minutes i'm giving up if i cook these any longer they're going to burn here they are side by side oiled sprouts are on the right and on the unoiled sprouts you can see how hard i have to push my fork in there they cooked for nearly twice as long and they are still not done also their flavor wasn't nearly as good so what's going on here well keeping the food from sticking to the pan is i think not the most important reason that we cook with oil oil or any kind of liquid fat has a much more significant role to play in that pan let's do it again with the thermal imaging camera i got some broccoli this time same basic deal that film of oil is serving as what they call a thermal interface the pan surface is flat and rigid the food is not so only teeny little bits of the food are actually making physical contact with the metal the oil essentially reaches up from the bottom of the pan and grabs hold of those bits that are floating just above the surface and because oil is a tremendously good conductor of heat energy from the pan is transmitted into more parts of the food than the pan itself could reach if i pull up this piece of broccoli you can see its whole face is really hot not just the parts in immediate contact with the metal and look at the nice brown color you get from that let's do this again with no oil in the pan and you can see that the heat on the broccoli is more localized to the few points making actual contact but also you can see that the overall heat of the food is just lower we simply aren't getting nearly as much energy in there and so this is going to take a lot longer and parts of the outside will probably be burned by the time the inside is tender now fat is not the only thermal interface that's available to us here in the kitchen right we also cook food all the time in water we boil food in water for the same reason we fry it in fat it's this heat conducting medium that can wrap itself all the way around the food and you could use water like oil in a saute just throw down a thin film of it and it will reach up and fill the gaps between the food and the pan surface conducting heat up into whatever you're cooking water might be the better dietary choice for those of us who maybe eat too many calories but it has some distinct disadvantages compared to oil in this context most cooking oils can get into the neighborhood of 400 fahrenheit 200 c before they even start breaking down into substances that aren't oil anymore water under normal atmospheric pressure can only get up to 212 fahrenheit c before it starts becoming something other than water namely steam it evaporates and leaves the pan that's bad for a saute because you'll have to keep replenishing the water but more significantly it's bad because browning reactions cannot happen at such a low temperature my yard reaction and caramelization both start around 330 fahrenheit 165c under normal terrestrial conditions water simply will never get that hot plus water isn't as viscous as fat so it's not going to coat the food as well as oil would therefore in order to use water is a really effective thermal interface you generally have to submerge food in it you got to boil it or you got to enclose the food in steam like you could put a lid on this pan right now and that's not a bad way to steam food if you don't have a steamer basket without a lid these are also just taking a very long time to cook i had them in there for 15 minutes and they're still not quite tender enough remember the ones we cooked in oil took six minutes so now you might be thinking yeah well i guess maybe you do need to coat vegetables in a little bit of oil in order to cook them in a pan vegetables have hardly any fat in them naturally what about something that does like meat why do you have to oil meat doesn't meat have enough fat inside itself to cook itself well let's try it i've got a little piece of sirloin steak here no extra fat at all on there just whatever is naturally in the meat and the first thing i notice it is stuck like glue to the pan meat is mostly water and protein and protein is particularly prone to sticking proteins form complexes with metal atoms at high temperatures they literally bond once the surface of the meat is really brown and rigid you can usually pull it off without tearing up the meat too much this is going to take some scraping unfortunately and yum look at that delicious golden crust i mean the meat is flat and pliable so it made much better contact with the pan surface than the vegetables did but you can still see some of that extreme contrast between the nearly blackened bits that touched the metal and the gray bits that seem to get hardly any heat at all there probably isn't enough fat in this meat to serve as a thermal interface or if there is not enough of it rendered out into the pan fast enough to coat the surface how exactly fats prevent food from sticking to the pan i'm not totally sure i've read several reputable scientific sources on the subject that don't seem to fully agree with each other it's certainly true that oils or all liquid fats will spread out across the pan and form some kind of a barrier between the proteins and the metal and because it's such an effective thermal interface fat cooks the surface of the meat a lot faster and more thoroughly and a really brown crust releases from the pan much more easily i also noticed that the whole steak is cooking much faster with oil in the pan and it tastes way better there's certainly some other chemical magic that happens between fats and other substances at high temperatures that create delicious flavors indeed we can observe a huge difference even if we take sticking totally out of the equation sirloin in a non-stick pan with no oil there's no sticking but nonetheless it's cooking really slowly and that crust is even worse at least with the stainless steel pan the meat stuck to the metal and that held it in contact with the heat on teflon there's nothing to stop big balloons of steam from pushing the meat up up and away from the hot pan and that's where you get those repulsive patches of gray even in a non-stick pan we still need oil to serve as a thermal interface and for its other flavor benefits now i bet some of you are thinking unfair test beef sirloin is a really lean cut of meat what if you were to cook a fattier cut without any supplemental oil indeed something like wagyu beef needs no extra fat at all in my experience how about this skin on chicken thigh i'm putting this into a dry and cold pan and then i'm gradually bringing in the heat this is the classic french way of cooking duck breast in a pan fat starts to render at relatively low temperatures so you give it a little head start to melt out some fat before the heat really gets going and cooking the meat by then you've got plenty of fat in the pan and the meat can fry itself works great with duck breast because duck breast has a huge layer of fat under the skin i thought it worked okay on this thigh not as good probably because there just isn't as much fat that skin has a bit of that weird mixture of overdone and underdone you get without sufficient thermal interface probably from the lack of fat at the very beginning of cooking not my favorite but of course all of this is subjective i mean the results are objective but whether or not you like them is totally subjective consider certain indian style breads that are cooked in a dry pan sorry this is not non-dough it's pizza dough just what i had available but this is a way that naan is often cooked dry pan no fat again highly localized browning or even blackening i'll do it again this time with oil in the pan and again generalized golden browning because of the thermal interface this one with no oil tastes like bread this one tastes like a donut i mean it's kind of awesome but this one does a better job of replicating the dry heat effects you get from an oven speaking of which do you really need to oil food before it goes in the oven let's find out i've got some mixed vegetables on this tray fatty beef roast and chicken thighs over here oil on one side of each pan only and i'll toss that around to get everything coated maybe a little foil snake will serve as some kind of a barrier between the oiled and unoiled sides into a 400 fahrenheit oven oiled food is on the right half an hour later the vegetables look done and boy that is not as big a difference as i was expecting both sides got about the same amount of color at least on top look underneath this parsnip was coated in oil and the side that touched the metal got beautiful golden brown i want to eat that over on the no oil side the part of the parsnip touching the metal has some of that same uneven coloration you get without the interface of the oil a mixture of burned and pale it's also kind of dry not as appetizing imho back over on the meat tray wow the oiled beef looks exactly the same as the unoiled beef there is an appreciable difference on the chicken though the oiled skin looks a little nicer than the unoiled skin i would guess that's because the skin served as a barrier preventing rendered fat from pushing up and settling on the surface whereas the open structure of this beef allowed for plenty of rendered fat to settle on the surface yep oil does not make as big of a difference in the oven as i would have guessed why i'm not totally sure i intended today's video to be more of a practical guide than a science explainer if you want more of the latter might i suggest our friend jay kenji lopez alts excellent book the food lab which you can listen to on audible the sponsor of this video my dad trained me in the art of making open-faced tuna melts on saturdays he also taught me a valuable lesson and how not to cut a block of frozen beef straight from the freezer into steaks a memorable afternoon that included the line kenji go get me the hammer don't worry the science gets

squarespace so my mom makes these awesome caramel brownies and for years after i left home she would bake them whenever i came back around and she remembered that i like them refrigerated so they're extra chewy like pull the fillings out of your teeth levels of chewy to make them chewy you got to get yourself one pound 454 grams of soft caramel candies and unwrap every single one of them this will take a while it's a good job for small hands which is why my niece is helping out good thing too it used to be my job i can't emphasize enough you got to do this with soft chewy caramels i don't even want to know what hard caramels would do in this recipe maybe explode we're going to take a package of german chocolate cake mix yes cake mix one of these standard boxes that's just under a pound 432 grams i'm sure any box cake would be fine as long as it's chocolate pour it in here and don't worry it's gonna make brownies not cake brownies are chocolate cake but with proportionally more fat and less water so they're too heavy to rise i give this to my lovely assistant igor to get rid of the fat will be three quarters of a stick of softened butter 85 grams and what little water we'll be using comes from a third of a cup of evaporated milk save that can we'll use more later a third of a cup is like 80 mls this is the same thing as sweetened condensed milk but with no added sugar make sure you use evaporated and not sweetened condensed otherwise it'll be way too sweet and then we are going to stir all this together you could totally do this without an electric mixer but it'll be a bit of effort to keep this from being cake we have to majorly restrict the moisture content there aren't even any eggs in there so when it finally starts to come together it's going to be extremely thick it looks like clay and that's probably about right and that's it for the mixing everything else is going to get layered in we should have preheated the oven but we didn't so we'll do it now i'm going to say something but i figured you had a no i didn't have a plan no oven at 350 fahrenheit 180c another third of a cup 80 mils of evaporated milk goes into those caramels in a heat-safe bowl this goes in the microwave for like a minute and then check on it you want to get it just hot enough that it'll melt into a thick caramel sauce and you won't know if you're there until you start stirring and spreading the heat around you could do this in a pot over low heat on the stove that'd be fine but just barely melt it either way if it gets too hot it could kind of seize up or even burn you'll also want to get a cup of chopped nuts ready maybe 150 grams those are pecans but you could use anything back to the chocolatey dough so now what we're going to do is we're going to take half of this mixture like break it up with your fingers spread it over the pan just in little dollops all over this nine by 13 inch cake pan it could be any size in that neighborhood and then you actually pre-bake those bits for like five minutes until they look like little cookies i know that's weird but go with it so we're gonna sprinkle six ounces of chocolate chips on top that's a cup 170 grams darker chocolate would probably work better here everything else around them is super sweet sprinkle on that cup of chopped nuts making sure you get the edges and the corners and then we're going to pour the caramel on top of that lovely stuff but if you over bake it it goes past chewy and becomes straight concrete that's why we had to pre-bake the bottom layer of the cake mixture you got to give that a head start so that it will be done by the time the caramel is done now i take the remaining dough and distribute that over the top don't forget to put a blob in each corner yeah the cake mix is so thick that it's going to barely spread in the oven so you got to get it into the corners yourself but it's good that it won't spread that means that after it bakes you'll have some surface that's cake and some surface that's caramel heterogeneity so here we go 18 minutes 18 minutes in my mom's oven at least every oven is different just pull it out when it still looks a little underdone like that it should be very soft when hot as it cools that caramel is going to firm up a ton so you got to account for that here it is cooled down on the counter the same night we baked it still has a bit of a gooey vibe if you're into that personally i am not i like it the next day refrigerated now it's so chewy that it occupies a liminal space between cake and candy you know i talk a lot about my italian american heritage on this channel but this dessert speaks to my waspy heritage from my mom this is what i think of as an ohio recipe having grown up in ohio it's it's quick it's easy it's tasty and it contains some kind of embarrassing shortcuts personally i don't think any shortcuts are embarrassing if they get to where you're trying to go i mean you call squarespace a shortcut but

Thanks to Dr....",2022-12-01 14:47:05.183328, hey what even is beer beer is a complex thing far more complex than say wine wine is fruit juice that just stick in a barrel or something and you let it ferment for a few weeks that's basically it you can put yeast in it yourself to ferment it but there's already yeast on the fruit there's yeast in the air to make wine you really just smash up some fruits and wait until the yeast ferment all the sugars into alcohol that's all you can think of beer as wine made from grains rather than from fruits problem with that is grain doesn't have sugar in it it has starch and starches are long chains of sugar that yeast cannot eat the first thing you need to make beer is malt i have a whole video about what malt is linked in the description but here's the short version malt is whole grain that you've gotten wet so that it will sprout or start growing into a new plant when it just starts to grow it is full of amylase enzymes that will break starches down into sugars you dry the seeds out to stop them from growing any further and then you have grains filled with enough enzymes to convert both themselves and even more grains into fermentable sugar when you when you start talking about how people discover this you're getting back into the question of two big early human civilization points of view that's dr nathan duncan of maryville college in tennessee where he teaches a chemistry of beer course this video series is the very short version of that course the classic point of view has been people started cultivating cereal grains started making things like bread now all of a sudden you're not relying on constantly searching for food because you can store grain for a long time and now you have free time and they started doing things like making beer from it those two things always come hand in hand but then there's other places in the world that that we find evidence of fermentation of beer that pre-date any any archaeological evidence for our agriculture suggesting that they gathered wild grains brought them to a place to make beer from it and then said hey this would be a whole lot easier if we started just growing the grains that we want and going from there do you realize what this means this means that in some places at least people may have invented civilization for the purposes of making beer beer is therefore a subject for serious scientific inquiry that is why dr duncan is getting ready to brew some beers here in the science building's outdoor classroom assisting him is chemistry major mackenzie lamb who is doing her senior study on brewing i'm looking specifically at the bioconversion of terpenes in the fermentation process which come from the hops that we add to the beer yeah i don't really know what that means either but this i do understand this is a recipe for the beer duncan and lamb are brewing today actually they're brewing two today they're brewing an ipa like this india pale ale that's a light-colored beer hence the pale and they're gonna be brewing a scottish ale like this which is a darker beer the difference between this and this the main difference is the particular cocktail of grains that they start with this one basically the ipa was basically almost entirely base malt specifically this base malt this is a variety of barley called two row barley that has been sprouted and then kilned or dried at low temperature and that's it that's 88 of the grains in dr duncan's ipa all beers must have at least some base malt in them the base malt is key it's what's going to convert the starches into sugars for the yeast to ferment however base malt by itself doesn't taste very interesting and at worst it can taste kind of green is the term that they use to describe it it tastes kind of vegetal not a fan to balance out that flavor brewers generally include some roasted malt malt that you have heated until it browns to varying degrees roasting the malt destroys the enzymes that would convert the starches into sugar but it also creates amazing roasty toasty nutty flavor notes that to me really define the taste of beer so for dr duncan's ipa he's got 88 base malt malt that has not been roasted at all and then for the rest of it he's got some roasted malts including this one this is another barley malt called crystal 20. the number here this is crystal 20 40 60 and they go up by by values of 20. the higher that number the darker the more caramel like the flavor is going to be the remaining malt in the ipa is called kerapils that's a trademarked name for a light roasted malt made by a proprietary process and it tastes a lot like grape nut cereal there's a reason for that grape nut cereal contains keropel's malt yeah that'd do it i suppose the recipe for dr duncan's scottish ale is really pretty similar it's 76 percent base malt and then there is some malt that has been smoked or peated we talked about this in the malt video in scotland they historically generated the heat for kilning or roasting malt by burning peat because they have a lot of peat and not many trees burning peat makes a lot of smoke and depending on how you do it you can end up getting that smoke on the malt which gives it a strong smoky flavor when they say a particular scotch whiskey is very peaty that means there's lots of smoked malts involved smoked mold is also used in many styles of beer like porters and stouts the third malt in dr duncan's scottish ale is a brand called karafa it is a very very dark roasted malt similar to this one that he showed me this one don't try it i mean unless you wanna taste like burnt this is going to be something that you would use if you're making something like a guinness stout i did taste it and it tasted like straight espresso beans extremely strong stuff only 1.7 of the malt in dr duncan's scottish ale is going to be that super dark roasted stuff the difference between a stout like guinness and a pale ale like miller lite which they have almost the exact same amount of calories is that small percentage of black barley that gives guinness its dark color so the more dark roasted malt in your beer the darker and nuttier and toastier and roastier the flavor is gonna be but counter-intuitively they can also make your beer sweeter the browning reactions that happen in the malt at high roasting temperatures change the sugars in there the amylase enzymes won't necessarily break them down into glucose because it can't because you've dehydrated some of the oxygens off of the off of the sugar backbone and it's going to not only not be broken down by the enzymes but it's also not going to be fermented by yeast so caramel flavors are going to impart a residual sweetness that will survive the fermentation process and that's how you get some of those that malty sweetness that you find in like english brown ales or porters so back out here in the open air classroom we've got the malt mixture for the scottish ale he has crushed that a little just cracked open the seeds in a milling machine into that goes a little modern technological help a ph buffer a substance that will resist changes in acidity and bacidity to keep it in the low ph that's necessary for good starch conversion we're using some 5.2 stabilizer that'll keep it at the right ph that's the kind of thing you can obviously brew without but it makes the results more predictable the process easier to control in goes warm water enzymes in the base malt are activated by water and they are most effective at converting starch into sugar at high temperatures but not too high too high a temperature and you'll cook them enzymes are proteins you will denature them at very high temperatures you're looking for a sweet spot you know 150 to 160 fahrenheit sweet spot and so what i'm doing is i'm just kind of stirring it because it's i mean if you see how thick this is uh it's not unusual for it to be when you first add the water for it to be kind of uneven so i'm trying to redistribute the heat but i'm trying to do it kind of quickly to not lose it because you see that steam coming off it's definitely cooling off once they've got it to a porridge consistency duncan will seal it off to preserve the heat in there and start on the ipa he's pouring hot water into the empty cooler just to temper it bring it up to temperature because it's a little cold out here this morning in goes all that crushed up malt and then they start stirring in the warm water you can almost immediately smell this has that cara pills in it you can almost immediately smell the sweetness from that when that water hits it i'm gonna smell great going into bio if you're wondering why they aren't working super clean with hair nets and everything keep

all of the enzymes that are going to convert all of those starches into sugars for the yeast in fact this is looking too hot so in goes a bunch of cool water to compensate but not too much because then your mash would be too thin what they're making here is called a mash by the way you don't want it too thick so that you can't dissolve your sugars into it but you also don't want it so thin that you can't that the concentration of sugar to or starch to enzyme is too low too low and there just won't be enough starch floating around in there for the enzymes to convert into sugar but you can see they've got plenty of starch in there now see how starchy this is it's just like white so cloudy right now that's all the starch the starch isn't super soluble in about an hour what comes out of this is going to be pretty clear they've got both mashes sealed up into coolers called tons mash tuns and now it's time to just wait we use these igloo coolers because they provide kind of a semi-constant temperature at least over the one hour duration that it takes to convert all the starches into sugar meanwhile dr duncan will use his turkey fryer burners here to bring some more water up to temperature for the next stage hey what kind of water is that we have a mountain spring that we go and get water that's from a mountain spring right here in blount county tennessee this is important water is the number one ingredient in the beer by weight and volume if you use tap water that doesn't taste good then your beer might not taste good plus if there's chlorine in there that your city puts in the water to sterilize it it could potentially kill some of the yeast that you're relying on to ferment this this invites the question should you use distilled water instead then you lose a lot of the minerals that are needed that for the yeast as well and also the water doesn't have the same kind of buffering capacity when it comes to maintaining the proper ph during the mash though some brewers do use distilled water as like a blank canvas to which they add back in minerals to achieve certain effects so if you want to make like a true pilsner you can add the right salts to make your water uh closely mimic that of pills in czechoslovakia czech republic i guess is now burton water salts mimic the hard water that's at burton on trent where a lot of english ales originated and so if you're brewing with your local water you're making beer that really reflects your local environment dr duncan says different salts different ions that are in the water well we taste them directly so it's not just a matter of how they affect the chemistry of the brew we also just taste them and other things in here will taste differently in the presence of those minerals so water is super important one hour is up so it's time to connect a little hose to a valve at the bottom of the mash tun and open it up this is our first runnings off of our mash and so what i'm doing here is i'm just recirculating it to kind of let the grains that are in there create their own filter bed to block out some of the finer particulates and give us the clearest possible work that we can get wart there's a typically mellifluous germanic word wart the name for this sweet liquid they've made out of grain is wart and by recirculating some of the wort through the coarse mesh filter at the bottom of this cooler dr duncan is concentrating the finer particles at the top of the grain bed to make a fine filter traditionally the grain is its own filter which is another reason why barley is good for making malt and beer if you saw my malt video i made malt out of some wheat that i had grown bread wheat one feature of wheat that has been bred for bread is that inedible husk or chaff that falls off the grain really easily that's good for bread but bad for beer we need that insoluble fiber to serve as a filter for the wart take the alternative to the extreme imagine if you made a wart not out of just barely crushed whole wheat barley but instead you made a wart out of some finely milled refined white flour that could work if you used malt flour you could make a wart out of that but the resulting liquid would be like a really thin dough how on earth would you filter the cloudiness out of that and that haze is mostly proteins if you taste what's coming off there now it's i mean it's just what i got on my finger it's sticky and it tastes like that malt syrup it doesn't have any starchiness to it at all indeed if you boiled that wart down you would have malted barley syrup which is this very tasty stuff that is used in baking or you can use it directly as a sweetener like honey here's the wart for the scottish ale remember the only difference is the particular cocktail of malts they started with it definitely smells sweet but you can smell that peat smoke in it this process of draining wart out of the grain bed this is called lottering and unfortunately it leaves a lot of good fermentable sugar behind in the grain bed so to wash some of that good stuff out you then have to sparge the grain run fresh hot water over the grains to dissolve as much sugar out of them as you can sparging is done lots of different ways dr duncan is doing a continuous sparging and lautering process here he's gently sprinkling fresh hot water down through the mash tun at about the same rate at which the wart comes filtering down out of the bottom the sugars are all moving downward and hopefully the flow rate is faster than diffusion so it doesn't mix it all up as long as it's added gently to the top of the grain time to bust out the refractometer and start measuring the sugar content of the wart depending on the liquid's specific gravity light will pass through it differently and you can quantify the sugar content if the sugars are too concentrated you lower the efficiency of the whole system that makes sense right pure water is going to be able to dissolve more sugar out of the grain bed than water that already has a ton of sugar in it so if the liquid you're passing through the grain is too sweet you're going to end up leaving lots of good sugar behind inefficient on the other hand if you dilute the liquid too much the warts simply won't be strong enough and the beer won't be strong enough not enough alcohol not enough anything except for water and we are at 1.00 and this beer this beer theoretical should be at about 1.075 historically brewers would have judged this by color or taste if the specific gravity gets too low if he adds too much water he could always boil it back out again before the yeast go in or he could just add sugar there's my cheat i'll add extra just plain dry malt extract uh and i'll get it to the gravity that i want it if i if i need to i'm hoping i don't have to use this but if i do that extract is pretty cool stuff it's just the malt barley syrup but convert it into a powder to give it a longer shelf life we'll take the syrup and they to make that powder they will freeze spray dry it where they're essentially under a vacuum they're sprayed in a fine mist and the rest of the water evaporates out of it and it settles as this dust no such cheating is required today duncan has extracted just about all he can from this grain historically this would now have become fertilizer or animal feed not even historically that's today that's what you know what is what is budweiser miller any of the major breweries do with their spent grains they go down the road and they get processed into cattle feed so now it's time to boil the warts for a while brewers do this for a few reasons they boil to reach the sugar concentration they want they boil to sterilize the liquid to kill any microorganisms that could compete with the yeast and make the beer taste bad or even make it dangerous to drink boiling also helps to further clarify the wart the reason mackenzie has to stir this constantly is it's full of cloudy proteins that'll foam up and boil over if she doesn't break the surface tension through stirring the proteins are going to denature that includes the amylase enzymes and when they do that they form these clumps because essentially like proteins are strings of amino acids and they're folded into a three-dimensional shape that gives them their function when they denature all those forces break and they basically become a linear strand of just amino acids and then they clump together and they form this gummy stuff that looks like egg drop soup in fact if you make egg drop soup that's the proteins in the egg whites coagulating so they'll keep stirring and stirring until they get a good rolling boil and observe what brewers call the hot break hot break is that is that process from when the proteins go from being in solution to coagulating and they come out of solution they look like little gummy strings that are in there and those will settle out of the beer and you know some places might filter them just let gravity do the work the last big reason to boil the wart is to extract flavor from supplemental ingredients like hops beer does have that residual malty flavor which is kind of sweet and so historically there have been a lot of different herbs and spices that have been used to kind of balance out just that sweetness just about anything you can think of so bitter or acidic flavorings like hops work really well what even are hops and how do you take this sweet wart and convert it into a frothy delicious beer we're going to talk about all of that in part two part two is where the wine maker begins winemakers start with a sweet delicious liquid we've only now just gotten there with our beer and we'll take it the rest of the way next time,3

***DOUGH RECIPE, MAKES FOUR PIZZAS THIS SIZE***...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.183328," I'm generally not a toppings man. I like simple
pizza. But this pizza we keep finding ourselves making at home, over and over and over again.
This bresaola is maybe the perfect pizza meat. Even if you don't eat meat, I hope to give
you some ideas about what makes a good topping and how to put in on. No, I do not think it's
as simple as putting it on top. I'm also gonna show you a different dough
recipe. I recently made some bagels and wanted to try applying the same basic concept to
pizza crust. 1 and 3/4 cups water — just over 400 mL in a bowl. Into that goes as much
bread flour as I can easily mix in, which is about four cups, maybe 475g. No real kneading
at this stage. I'm just getting all the flour wet and then I'll dig a little hole in the
center. Cover and let autolyse for an hour. If you
have trouble kneading pizza dough enough, try an autolyse or pre-soak phase where you
just let the flour and water sit. The kneading will now be much easier. We need fermentable
sugars for the yeast, and yeah, I'm using my new favorite ingredient, which is malted
barley syrup. This gives a nice flavor and brown color to breads. I'm eyeballing in a
couple tablespoons. But you could use a tablespoon or two of table sugar instead. A quarter cup, 60 mL of warm water into the
belly button where I was also careful to drizzle a little syrup to feed this packet of dry
yeast, 2-3 teaspoons. Stir it around. No worries if some of it spills over. I'm really just
making sure my yeast is still alive before I sit around waiting from my dough to rise.
Yep, they're still alive. That was a 10-minute time lapse. I like a nice glug of olive oil in pizza dough
for flavor and browning, and maybe a tablespoon of coarse salt, 15g. Another handful of flour
in the mix will essentially grab onto all that loose moisture and make it less slippery
as you kneed. If you just soak your flour in plain water
for awhile, enzymes basically pre-knead your dough for you. Check how elastic that already
is. This is gonna take five minutes of kneading at most until it feels solid and stretchy.
People make a lot of claims about the autolyse improving flavor and texture — I think those
claims are overblown, but it definitely saves labor. I'm adding the minimal amount of flour necessary
to handle this and keep it from sticking to me. Probably ended up with just 5 cups total
in there, 600g at most. I think super-wet pizza doughs taste way better; they're just
harder to handle. And I'll do one thing I don't normally do
for pizza which is a bulk ferment. Cover that up and let it do a preliminary rise for an
hour or two until it's big and puffy. Now I'll punch this down and divide it into four
individual balls for four individuals pizzas. If it feels like I need to dust on some flour
just so I can handle it, I will. That's fine. So yeah, I'm gonna rise individual balls again
in oiled containers, like I normally do. I find doing a bulk ferment ahead of this gets
you a different texture in the finished pie. I'm not sure I prefer it, but I like it. It's
chewier and it puffs up more in the oven if you do the bulk ferment. No need to get those
balls really smooth and perfect. They're so soft, they're just gonna melt into the container.
And yes I use a lot of oil. This is sticky dough, it's gonna be hard to get out later
without oil, and oil tastes good on the crust. Use the dough to paint the oil around everywhere. Seal those guys up, and you can rise them
for another couple hours on the counter before baking. Or, I think you get better flavor
if you throw them in the fridge and wait a day or up to a week. In the meantime, I'll purchase the indulgence
of all that bread with a low-carb breakfast from Magic Spoon, the sponsor of this video.
Magic Spoon is the high-protein, grain-free cereal that tastes like a sugared-up kids
cereal and yet isn't terrible for you. Hey, real talk: Some people have asked me
why Magic Spoon isn't as cheap as conventional breakfast cereal. Well, why is that stuff
so cheap? Because it's made of grain. One of the main reasons why most of us probably
eat too much grain is that grain is incredibly cheap. That's what it's in everything. Mmm, chocolatey. And instead of being grain,
this is chiefly made of milk protein. I choke down protein shakes all the time. In contrast,
I actually like this, and it's 0 sugar, just 4 net grams of carbs, a whole 13g of protein.

remains this brand of ground tomatoes, but they only come in giant cans that'll top like
six pizzas each, so I've gotten in the habit of freezing what I don't use in a bag. Easy
to break off a piece thaw it. You need at most half a cup, 120mL to top a single home-oven
sized pizza. And today I'm adding some dried basil, dried
oregano, a little garlic powder — too much garlic detracts from the sweetness, I think.
Grind in some pepper, a pinch of chili flakes maybe, a pinch of sugar and a little glug
of olive oil. Stir that up, and that's actually like twice what I need for one pizza. Cheese. Yes, I live in a bigger city now and
I can get all kinds of good mozzarella. This brand of whole milk, low moisture string cheese
remains my favorite mozzarella for pizza. For me, nothing beats it. But whatever cheese
you use, consider using a little less if you plan to put on a lot of toppings. I normally
use 6 ounces for a pizza this size. This is just 4 ounces, 113g. And I find that if I
keep it cold until the last second, that keeps it from overheating as much in the oven and
squeezing out a ton of grease. Hey, there's my puffy doughs. The ones I don't
bake today I will freeze, now that they're fully risen. I love shallots generally, and man are they
the perfect allium topping for pizza. They're small and thin, so they don't overwhelm the
texture of the pizza and they don't leak out a bunch of water. A half of one of those will
be enough to top a pizza. I think a key to topping is to go easy, at least with a thin-crust
pizza. Too much stuff and the whole thing just becomes a sloppy mess. Now, that perfect pizza meat. Bresaola — beef
prosciutto. It looks and tastes great, it's very thinly sliced, which is what I want in
any topping. And check out how little fat there is. It's generally made from the eye
of round, which is one of the hamstrings. It's a lean cut, so it won't leak as much
grease onto the surface of the pie as something like pepperoni often does. Lastly I'll approach the herb tower pick some
good ol' flat leaf parsley. Parsley holds up better in the oven than basil does. It
stays greener. A little cornmeal on my peel and some flour.
I've got a very sticky dough, so I really need to powder up this peel if I hope to slide
the pizza off later, and I've found the combination of cornmeal and flour is really magic. There's
some composite effect when those two grain sizes are combined — they're really good
at keeping your pizza from sticking. But you gotta make sure you get it all the way around,
otherwise the dough will catch on the wood of those edges. If your peel leaves an outline
when you pick it up, that's a good sign. A super-wet dough is easier to handle when
it's cold, straight from the fridge. And I'm just letting gravity stretch it out for me
as I turn it and pinch out that fluffy outer ring of crust. On it goes and I can stretch
it a little more on the peel. I don't care if it's round. I can bake a bigger oblong
pizza in a home oven. I just want to get it stretched a little wider than I want it, because
it's gonna contract a bit before we're done here. Like, I'm gonna shake this a few times as
I'm building it, just to keep it from sticking, and see how it shrank a little when I did
that? Sauce on — a very thin layer on a thin crust.
Everything's gotta be thin or else the pizza will be sloppy and floppy. A layer of parmesan
right under the mozz is great for flavor and I use the fake shakey cheese for pizza. It
just tastes right to me. Now, I'm gonna tear on a few big shreds of
my bresaola. I think most toppings work way better if they are threaded through the cheese
layer, rather than sitting entirely on top of it. So, with the some of the meat down,
now I'm gonna put on some of my cheese, and I'm trying to partially cover the meat. Give that a little shake again, just to keep
it from sticking. A little more cheese and then some of my little shallot strips. Then
more strips of bresaola. Looks like a lot, but it's super thin. I only used about an
ounce, 30g maybe. More cheese partially covering the meat. My remaining shallot. And then I'll
top with individual leaves of parsley, just for pretty. One more shake to make sure that's gonna release.
I've had my pizza steel pre-heating in there for an hour on my oven's highest possible
convection setting. This oven is way better for pizza than my last one. It gets way hotter,
and the convection fan gets more heat onto the sides of things. I get browner crust. Just seven minutes of baking and I'll remove
this directly to a cooling rack. People usually take it out with their peel. I like the rack
because it'll keep the bottom crispy by letting moisture escape. Also, if you're impatient,
you can do this rather undignified move I call the pizza wave. Air flows up through
the holes in the rack and all around and you can rapidly cool a pizza to eating temperature
this way. You can also take it over to the sink and
do the pizza shimmy. Shimmy it around and all the excess cornmeal and flour stuck to
the bottom just brushes off and falls through the holes into the sink. I love that trick. And now we can finally cut this up. Still
some grease leakage on there. That's gonna happen especially in a home oven, which is
not as hot as a pizza oven, therefore the pizza is in there for longer, therefore there's
more time for fat to render out of meat and squeeze out of cheese. But that's still not
bad. We have patches of deliciously browned cheese,
because we didn't cover all the cheese with toppings. We threaded the toppings through
the cheese. And we have bits of crispy browned bresaola, but also chewy soft bits underneath
the cheese — again, thanks to the threading. And the whole slice has excellent structural
integrity as you bite through it. This is because we didn't over-top it, and again,
because we threaded all the toppings through the cheese. The toppings function like rebar
inside the concrete of cheese. That's maybe not the most appetizing pizza
analogy I've ever come up with. But this may be the most appetizing pizza I've ever come
up with.",3
Why salt crystals grow as pyramids (sometimes),https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FVEZuzEHwQk/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLDUBo1-G8aUhKD6tjV6Ua0wnKXLEQ,FVEZuzEHwQk,"14 minutes, 56 seconds","Thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this video!

squarespace if you've ever been lucky enough to have some fancy expensive flaky sea salt you might have noticed a curious crystal shape in the mix it's a hollow pyramid this brand of sea salt from england is renowned for its particularly huge hollow pyramids it looks like they made them in a mold but they didn't that crystal grew that way naturally table salt isn't the only mineral that does this under the right conditions tons of rocks will crystallize that way scientists call it a hopper crystal a hopper is a big box in a factory that tapers down to a narrow point underneath it's used for funneling stuff into something else that's a hopper the crystal looks like a hopper so they call it a hopper crystal a lot of people myself included consider this a highly desirable shape for a finishing salt that is a salt that you put on right at the end if the salt is going to be dissolved in the food then that's a waste of a good crystal talking about salt that you put in right at the end so that it will be intact on the top as you start to eat because the crystal is big the saltiness is concentrated rather than being dispersed evenly across the food this results in a heterogeneous eating experience different areas of the food taste different and combine in interesting ways in your mouth as you chew and because those pyramidal crystals are hollow they crunch as you bite through them but as salt goes salt products that have this shape in them tend to be very expensive because the traditional processes that give you this crystal shape are not quick there may be less traditional ways of growing them a little bit faster but all of my experiments at home have failed and i've tried a million things this is actually an area of active proprietary research by snack food companies hollow salt crystals have more surface relative to their total mass so they dissolve faster in your mouth and therefore they taste saltier if snack makers can grow tiny hollow salt crystals they can give us products that taste as salty as those covered in solid crystals but with less salt and then they can sell us a bag that says same great taste now with less sodium those companies are not going to share their research with me but this guy will share his research with us my name is pietro fontona i'm a chemical engineer and retired since 10 years my hobby are crystals and crystal crows dr fontana has published some awesome work on salt hopper crystals in recent years and he's going to explain to us why they happen quick note dr fontana is swiss he's not super confident in his english so when he and i spoke he talked a lot of the time from prepared remarks that he had scripted in advance i think that's totally fine that's just why it sounds the way that it does he also made a powerpoint presentation i'm going to show you those slides as we go the common salt has a chemical formula of nacl it is composed of positively charged sodium and negatively charged chloride ions okay so when you dissolve salt in water those ions those individual electrically charged sodium and chloride atoms when they dissolve in water you split them apart once fully dissolved there are no sodium chloride molecules swimming around in here anymore the water has broken the ionic bonds between the sodium and the chloride each individual atom is now surrounded by water technically there is no salt in this pot anymore it's a new substance commonly called brine but as you evaporate the water out you eventually reach a point where there just simply isn't enough water left to wrap around each of those atomic components of salt and keep them separate from each other you end up having sodium and chloride ions that are able to bump up together again and start bonding into salt you can already see it happening on the surface there solid salt rising up out of solution and floating on top you see here in the model of the salt structure with violet sodium and green chloride ions they are arranged in a three-dimensional periodical array where a sodium ion is surrounded by six chloride ions and the chloride ions is surrounded by six sodium ions the smallest possible unit with the sodium chloride structure is a cube a cube these attractive forces cause those ions to bunch up and squish in together and their natural tendency will be to bunch up in as compact a form as possible and the resulting shape is going to be a cube you might also get some other very simple geometric shapes depending exactly on how the first few ions actually start to come together but the most common shape is going to be a cube normally a crystal grows layer by layer and that's what dr fontana is showing us on this slide here as more ions come out of the solution and link up with the others they basically replicate that cubic shape over and over again that's the periodical array that dr fontano was talking about the period is the cubic shape the array is that cubic shape kind of self-replicating over and over and over again into a highly ordered structure that they call a crystal as a consequence soul crystals remain the shape of cubes from micrometer to centimeter sizes but that's with all things being equal when the attractions between these ions are allowed to do what they want to do without other things getting in the way in the real world there are other factors at play impurities in the water getting in between all the stuff convection currents pushing things around tiny variations in temperature that result in one area of the brine being more concentrated than another all these factors and more result in tons of different shapes of crystals in this spoonful of brine that i let evaporate in my kitchen i've got some hoppers i got some cubes i got some bars lots of different shapes going check this out when i slowly simmered all the water out of this brine i got salt crystals growing up in these spindly tendrils some of them like a centimeter long this is apparently just how salt molecules link up when being pushed around by the particular soup of forces at play in a simmering pot i don't claim to understand it but there it is in the case of hopper crystals these hollow pyramids that particular shape happens when the normal cubic growth of salt is interrupted by a few factors one being speed this block by block layer by layer cubic growth this happens when conditions in the brine are such that the crystal grows slowly when however the crystallization rate is so that the growing layer is not completed before new ions arrive hollow forms are developed this happens when the solution is really super saturated way more sodium and chloride ions in there than the available water can keep apart ions show up and start linking up on the edge of the crystal face before that new layer is even completed in the middle this is known as skeletal growth and the result is a hollow area in the center it grows at the basis and during the growth the summit looks down to the brine and once that happens the salt crystal is basically a boat floating on the surface it's buoyancy and the surface tension of the water keep its open face stuck to the surface of the water just like the surface of a boat it's dry on the inside so there's no way for new ions to get inside and start filling up the inside of the hopper new ions just keep linking up along the edges at the surface and the pyramid grows bigger and bigger and points down deeper and deeper into the brine i can actually show you this happening this is some brine that i have super saturated by boiling hot water can hold way more salt in solution than cool water can i lay a film of that brine on a glass surface it rapidly starts to cool down it can't hold all of that salt in solution anymore so crystals start forming really fast what i'm showing you under the microscope camera happened over the course of just a few minutes look at those hoppers form by growing the weight increases when the gravity force is higher then the force of the surface tension and the force of buoyancy the pyramid sinks to the bottom why does it fall well for the same reason that a bug can walk on water but i can't eventually you just get too heavy for the surface tension of water to be strong enough to hold you aloft these crystals just keep growing they get bigger and bigger they get so big and heavy that their buoyancy and the surface tension of the water is not strong enough to hold them at the top so they sink down to the bottom that's called sedimentation and once they're down there you will get no further hopper growth that's why in the traditional fleur de cell process they skim the crystals off the surface right before they fall it is extremely labor-intensive if the crystals fall the hollow pyramids might start to fill in which i think is what happened to me in this particular experiment that i did in the oven you can see that i've got a few little hollow crystals left there but most of these have grown into big solid blocks you gotta wonder then what would happen if you grew hopper crystals in a place where they could not fall a place where there is virtually no gravity to pull them down into the brine this is exactly what dr fontana and the american astronaut don pettit wanted to find out so while dr pettit was on the international space station he took out a little loop of wire and he dipped it into one of the packets of salt water they use to season their food up there i guess a salt shaker would be pretty messy in microgravity and the sodium chloride solution that we have in the galley is close to a saturated solution so once we draw one of these films it doesn't take much evaporation before the crystals start to grow because the gravitational forces are basically symmetrical up there you don't get pyramids you get hopper cubes six different hoppers one on each side of the cube all growing out in six different directions six different hollows on each side of the cube and because it will never sink the sky's the limit on size if you have a lot of material available and a lot of space it is no reason why it is not possible to make huge salt crystals in space of course to do that you'd have to keep isolating the crystals pull out a good one and get it growing by itself in a fresh film of brine this is true on earth as well if you let multiple crystals keep growing near each other they may eventually agglomerate or cake together that's what happened in my spoon experiment the crystals bond together in what's called a raft and thus their growth is restricted in every attempt that i made to grow big hopper crystals here at home agglomeration was the main limiting factor i posted this on my instagram i tried tons of different super saturation levels lots of different evaporation temperatures and humidities my crystals always caked together before the hoppers could grow to any decent size what happened here though well in that one i boiled my salt in a one-to-one mixture of water and ethanol booze salt doesn't dissolve in alcohol so i figured that maybe it would act as like a buffer it would get in between the growing crystals and keep them from agglomerating together before they had a chance to grow to a substantial size and i did end up getting very clean distinct crystals this is the biggest one that i got but as you can see it's not a hopper crystal it seems to have like the internal structure of a hopper crystal but the hollows are filled in dr fontana applauded my industry here but he couldn't really explain what was going on with the alcohol and he didn't really have any tips for me about how i could grow big hopper crystals myself at home as far as i can tell nobody at least on the internet has cracked this particular code there's lots of guides online for how to make your own flaky salt at home but if you look at those they've got these rafts forming at the top of their brine and the crystals are agglomerating long before you get big distinct hopper crystals the dock pointed out to me that all the traditional processes are very particular they have to be done in big pools so the crystals have lots of space they require just the right rate of evaporation just the right temperature just the right humidity basically the conditions you get on the mediterranean coast where they make fleur-de-celle but even fleur-de-celle usually doesn't have very big hopper crystals i've seen some big ones that remain on cypress but the biggest ones i've ever seen are malt and sea salt this very expensive salt made on the southeast coast of england i've emailed the mauldin company several times and apparently they are not interested in sharing their centuries-long trade secrets with me totally understand that there is this promotional video that they made that i've linked in the description judging on what i can see in there i'm guessing that maybe it's their agitation of the brine that keeps the crystals from agglomerating before they can grow to a decent size but that is just a guess if anyone has any ideas on how to easily make hopper crystals at home drop them in

***CRUST RECIPE, MAKES 12 EMPANADAS***...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.183328," Empanadas are hand pies made in various ways
across the Spanish and Portuguese-speaking worlds. You'll see prettier ones than mine,
but these tasted darn good. And I just improvised the fillings, mostly with stuff I already
had, which I think is the traditional way of doing nearly any pie or dumpling. Historically,
it's a bag for leftovers. Use what you've got. I'ma show you a chicken filling and a
bean filling that's meatless. This crust is actually vegan, though it doesn't
have to be. For a dozen empanadas I've got three cups of flour, about 360g. And then
yes I am use butter-flavored shortening. Lard would be traditional, butter too, but this
shortening tastes real good, it gets you a more tender crumb and the pastry is easier
to work with — it's less brittle, less melty, than butter. I've got the equivalent of a stick of butter
in there, 4 oz, 113 grams. For salt I'm doing two teaspoons of Morton kosher, like 10g,
which is a little under-salted for me. It's gonna get some more salt later. I'll cut the fat into the flour with a pastry
cutter. But you could do this on a cutting board with a knife or a couple forks, and
obviously in a food processor. You could probably use up to twice as much fat as I'm using.
That'd be real tasty, but the dough would be stickier and more delicate — way harder
to work. Oh, in lots of countries they put in baking powder to make the crust kinda thick
and fluffy. You could do that. I want the thin, crispy vibe today. Once I've got that kinda breadcrumb consistency,
I'll crack in an egg. That's traditional. Also traditional would be enough cold water
to make it come together in a dough, but I'm using white wine because I think white wine
is amazing in pastry crusts. I started with like a third of a cup, 80 mL. The wine brings
a subtle floral sweetness, and the alcohol might make crusts a little more tender, but
here's the thing. I made empanadas for years using my basic
French pastry knowledge, which calls for kneading a pie crust hardly at all — almost no kneading
— just to keep everything very tender and crumbly. The problem is, such a crust is very
delicate, very hard to wrap around things, very likely to burst. So then I realized that
all these empanada recipes written by people who are actually from Latin countries tell
you to knead the dough for like 5 minutes. Traditionally, this is not a delicate pastry,
and a kneaded dough makes empanadas as easy to assemble as my new sofa from the sponsor
of this video, Allform. Allform is a sister brand of that mattress
maker that also supports the channel, Helix. And like my mattress, this new couch is super
comfortable. But the coolest thing about Allform stuff is that it's modular. You can buy pieces
and assemble them into 500+ different combinations of chairs and sofas with different seat numbers,
corners or no-corners, chaises, ottomans, all far cheaper than a typical custom-build
couch. For our new living room I ordered a three-seater leather sofa with a chaise, and
I didn't have to get it delivered by movers. It came in boxes. Shipping is free. The parts
are all American-made, you assemble them with these big wing nuts that are easy to turn.
I could order more seats or sections and add them on later if I want, or I could take a
section away and use it as a chair. That's great if you're gonna be moving to a different
place, or you're trying to make something fit in an odd-sized room. Really cool, and
so far the family loves lounging around on this thing. There's 100-day trial — Allform
will come pick it up if you decide you don't like it. Full refund within a hundred days.

Thank you, Allform. 20% off a sofa easy to assemble as these empanadas,
which will be even easier to roll after you let the dough sit in the fridge for at least
a half an hour. I'ma do my fillings while I wait. Chicken first. Again, I'm really just
improvising here. I've got a couple big chicken legs leftover from my thigh video. You could
use thighs. I'll just get those browning in a pot with a little oil. I don't care if the
skin sticks and gets torn up. I'm gonna shred this — I just want to create some brown
flavor in the pot. I've got a bunch of green onions. I'll slice
those up. I'll peel and chop a couple garlic cloves, and I've got a jalapeño. Yes I'm
shaving out the ribs to take out the spiciness. I have people coming over for dinner — empanadas
are really made for company, and some of my guests don't like heat. Dice those up. Got some brown on my legs — I'll spread
them and put in the peppers, the garlic, the white and white-ish green parts from my onions.
Stir those in and let them fry a little bit. I'll also put in some spices. I did some dry
oregano, cumin, smoked paprika and just a little cinnamon. Stir those spices and let
them fry for sec — that gives them a nice toasty flavor, but before they burn, in goes
a small can of tomatoes — I like this brand and I like the roasted variety for stuff like
this. I think they basically just blacken the skins. Deglaze that pan with all that,
and I'll put in a pinch of salt to start with, but I'ma be conservative because I'm gonna
reduce this down a lot later, after I just let this sit and simmer on low heat for like
an hour until the meat is soft. Stir it every now and then just to make sure
nothing is sticking to the bottom and burning. Here we are after an hour and you just push
on the meat and you can tell it's soft enough to shred. Pull those out to a cutting board
and let them cool until you can handle them. Meanwhile, I'll reduce all this down. Heat
up, I'll boil this and stir it constantly. That's a very thick, very sweet liquid, it
could very easily stick and burn, so stir. I think hand pies work best when the filling
is very intensely flavored, because you can't fit very much in there relative to the mass
of the crust. Also, I think they work best when the filling is pretty dry. That way the
pie doesn't leak when it's baking and it doesn't leak over you when you're eating it. We can
achieve all of these objectives if we just reduce this all the way down to a very intense,
thick sauce. We can always thin it out again if we overshoot the mark. Time to pull the chicken. I'ma get rid of
the skin. It's wet and slimy. Pull off the meat and you can feel with your fingers if
there's any tendons or chunks of cartilage that feel hard or slimy. Anything you don't
want to eat you can pull out, and then you can pull the meat into shreds but go easy
because it'll shred more as you stir it into the sauce. I'm also gonna chop this up a little
bit. I don't want super long strings of chicken coming out and falling on my chin as I eat
my pie. In the sauce that goes along with my onion greens. I've got some leftover manchego cheese — one
of or our favorite cheese to have with bread and wine. I'm just crumbling in like 50 or
60 grams, but you could use any cheese, or skip it. Stir that in. The filling is looking
really tight, really dry, which I think is good. Give it a taste. Needs some more salt,
and maybe I'll loosen up the texture a little with some water, but not much. That's really
good, and done. Here's a meatless filling that's way quicker.
I've got a shallot, a red chili and like half a pound of tomatillos. I'll just roughly chop
that shallot, and yeah, I think I want some garlic, too. I'll shave the ribs out of the
chili to remove some heat, and dice. Peel the husks off the tomatillos, and then I'm
just gonna kinda hack at them indiscriminately. This will help them cook down faster into
a sauce, and it'll limit the size of the skin pieces floating around. You won't end up with
any huge slimy bits of skin that are super noticeable. All that goes into some hot oil in a pan.
The wider the pan, the quicker this will cook down. After like 10 minutes I've got it softened
and reduced down to almost like a jam or a chutney consistency. That's gonna get me the
tight, intense filling that I think works well. A can of beans — kidney beans or whatever
beans, drained and rinsed, in the pan. Zest a lime and then juice in half of it to start
with. That might be enough. And then I got a handful of cilantro that I'll chop up, really
going for kind of a salsa verde vibe here. In that goes with a bunch of pepper. Hold
off on the salt until we can stir and taste because the beans are alrighty salty. Maybe
some oregano and a little sugar to balance the acidity. Vegans could obviously leave
it there, but I've got some leftover cotija cheese, which is one of those salty, crumbly
Mexican cheeses that doesn't really melt. So, to bind this filling I'll try to mash
up some of the beans as I stir everything together. The beans will be the binder. Give
it a taste. Needs some more salt, and there we are. For our next trick we'll need some egg wash
— one beaten egg loosened up with some water. And here's the dough. Some people roll
it out in one big sheet and then use a cutter to stamp out individual rounds. I think I'd
rather do the thing where you divide this into a dozen balls, roll them smooth, place
one between a couple sheets of parchment or wax paper and then smash. If I had a tortilla
press I'd use that. You can't really get it thin enough with a pan. That's just a good
way of getting it started, then you finish the job with a rolling pin. I'm getting these to where they're like thick
tortillas. And this way there's no excess trimming that you have to roll out again,
like you'd get if you punched out rounds with a mold. All done, here's a cookie sheet with
parchment for baking them on, and here's a spoonful of my chicken filling. People close
these all kinds of ways but I really like the thing where you gather up both sides around
the filling and then crimp across the top. When the seam is on top, the empanada is far
less likely to leak in the oven. On we go. It's honestly much easier to just fill all
of them at once — fewer hand washings this way. Plus, you can get all the way to the
end and if you run out, like I did, you can just steal a little bit from all the other
ones to fill the 12th one. I usually overfill all filled dough products anyway, so this
is good. If you want to know how to make your crimping
look really pretty, do not watch my channel. Go watch a video of some awesome Puerto Rican
grandma doing it. I'm just trying to get it closed. Looks like a stegosaurus. I only needed
to use egg wash for sealing these when I got to the last few pies. At this point the surface
had dried to where it wasn't really sticking anymore, so egg wash. Alright, chicken batch
is done. For the bean filling I have a second batch
of dough I made. Each of these filling recipes will fill a dozen empanadas on its own. Spoon
out all that filling. Again, whether I'm making these or ravioli I always have to put in a
little less filling than is my instinct. Start crimping all these up, and by the way,
you can put them pretty much right next to each other on the pan. They're not gonna spread
in the oven very much. Lauren wanted to come do some and yeah, hers look way nicer. I have
no idea how she did that, but thanks for the thumbnail, honey. Ok, and this is what I really wanted the egg
wash for. Slop it over the outsides, every crevice. This will make a beautiful, shiny
brown crust, plus things will stick to it, like this coarse salt I'm sprinkling on. This
is why I slightly under-seasoned the dough. Get a little heterogeneity there. Oven is at 400ºF, 200ºC, convection if you've
got it. And you just bake until they're brown. These took half an hour. And see what you
get by putting the seam on top? If and when they burst, gravity holds most of the filling
down inside, where it belongs. Beautiful, and I like the relatively light,
fresh vibe that you get by baking them. But people pan fry empanadas, or even deep fry
them. You do you. And legit, fill them with like whatever you've got. I think that is
the is the whole point.",3

My old video on...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.183328," Hey, can I tell you about my gas problem?
Gas burning stovetops. There's a lot of problems with them. I mean, there's a lot of good things
about them too, but you always hear about the good things. The biggest good thing is
that they are responsive, meaning you ignite them and they're instantly hot. You throttle
them down, they instantly cool off. At its core, it's a very simple mechanism. It's a
pipe. On one end of the pipe, there is a highly combustible and relatively clean-burning hydrocarbon,
and on the other end of the pipe, there is a fire. And then midway through the pipe,
there's a valve that opens and closes it. The more you open the valve, the more fuel
pours into the fire. And it's a literal fire right here in your home. So, it's romantic
in that way. The original cooking over an open fire, right here in your home. I get it. I was excited when I moved into
this house and this house came with a really nice, really expensive gas burning stovetop.
I hadn't had a gas stovetop since this really sketch apartment that I lived in briefly in
college. I was excited to try it. Here in the United States, electric ranges are twice
as common and as gas ranges, according to these estimates from the federal government.
So, naturally I've cooked on way more electric ranges in my time. I've been lucky enough
to cook on some good ones, and the good electric ranges are simply way more powerful. When we first moved in here, both my wife
and I noticed that it was taking a lot longer to bring pots of water up to a boil, usually
for pasta. How can this be when gas is more responsive? With electric, you turn it on
and it does not get hot instantly. It takes a few minutes to get up to heat. With gas,
you just turn it on and instantly it flames on. So how could it be that the water was
taking longer to boil? Because even though the heat comes on immediately,
there is less of it. Like over here, I'm going to start a slow pour. Several seconds later,
I'll start a faster pour. That cup is going to fill up way faster than the other one even
though the stove signified on the left there got off to a later start. Gas stove is on
the right. When Consumer Reports reviewed 171 current model ranges, the electric ones
clearly beat out the gas ones on the boil test. Not every single model, but in aggregate,
electric simply gets you more heat. Why is gas weaker? Well, technically it might
not be. Depends on the model of course. But it might just be an issue of efficiency. Gas
stoves are, generally, far less efficient at actually transferring their heat into your
food, and here's proof. This is a real thermal imaging camera — not one of those fake infrared
camera app filters that just simulates a thermal image. You're seeing real heat. Look at the
heat billowing up around the pot and escaping out into the kitchen. I'm not stacking the deck here. I've got this
small pot on my smallest gas ring. The ring and the pot are well matched. Now let's boil
some water on an electric burner, and see? The pot is hot, but there aren't the same
plumes of heat swirling up around it and away. It's just the nature of the beast that with
a gas stovetop, the pan has to be suspended up and away from the actual heat source, and
the gap in between the heat source and the pan is a place where heat can just get away. By way of example, look at all the heat that's
getting wasted on heating up the iron grate that the pot is sitting on. See how hot those
bars are? That's all wasted energy. When you're thinking about buying a stove
and you're looking at the thermal output ratings that the manufacturer lists, you got to think
about what they're actually telling you. Here in the United States, they would be sold by
BTUs per hour, which is British Thermal Units, how much BTUs it can put out in an hour. Well,
what are they telling you? Are they telling you the heat that the stove can in an hour?
Or are they telling you the heat that actually makes it into your pot over the course of
that same hour? Only one of those numbers actually matters, right? And in their defense,
I don't think they could actually tell you the number that matters, because it depends
on the pot, how much heat is actually going to make it into the pot. Now there are some new high-tech gas ring
configurations that are designed to address this problem by focusing the fire up a central
column. That's awesome, if you can get one of those. Though keep in mind that a billion
or more people actually depend on the heat leakage that they get from a traditional gas
ring like this. I'm talking about the billion or two people who cook primarily in woks. You cook in a wok, you actually want the heat
to wrap up and around the outer cone of the pan. That's why they make these electric burners
that woks can actually nest inside. If you mainly cook in a wok, this problem of heat
leakage might not even be a problem. Remember, this video isn't about your gas problem, it's
about my gas problem. And my problem is it takes way longer for
big pots of water to come up to a boil on here. It takes longer for me to reduce down
sauces and glazes. Devotees know I'm a glaze man, all day long. Another problem is that
the heat leakage tends to overheat things that are outside the pan, like this thermometer.
On an electric stove, you could just leave a thermometer hanging on the side of the pan
and like that, even if the display is not heat safe. But on the gas stove, I'm very close to melting
the plastic on that. The chicken came out good anyway. Of course it did, it's from the
sponsor of this video, HelloFresh, America's number one meal kit. Let me tell you about
them for a sec. You want to talk about efficiency? HelloFresh is all about it. The carbon footprint
of a meal in a box like this is actually lower than a similar meal cooked from groceries,

I'm going to have to stow in my cupboard somewhere and figure out how to use. Plus, I can cook this in less time than it
takes me to grocery shop. The average grocery trip is 41 minutes. I mean, I still cook from
groceries too, obviously, but it's awesome to have HelloFresh take care of me instead

HelloFresh. So yeah, my other gas problems. Stuff around
the pot tends to get it way too hot, not just thermometers, but spoons. I used to love perching
my stirring spoon on the side of the pan. I can't always do that on my gas stove. Depending
on the shape of the pot and all that, the spoon can literally burn, or burn me when
I go to pick it up. That's just a minor inconvenience. The bigger
problem I get is the scorching that I get around the inside rim of my pans. You can
see evidence of this right there. The walls of my pans tend to get so hot on this stove,
and sauces especially have a tendency to burn up there on the rim. This is a custard that
I was working on, I could not stop it from burning on the side of the pot. And now I
understand why so many people cook custards over double boilers, which is a thing I almost
never had to do on my electric stove. That burning happened even though I had my gas
heat all the way down, as low as possible. And that's another gas problem. All the way
down is often not low enough. You can only close off the valve so tight before there's
a risk that your flame goes out. If the flame goes out, you'll end up pouring uncombusted
gas into your kitchen, and that would be bad. So, these burners are designed to never let
you throttle them down so low that there's a risk of the flame going out. Unless you
have a special warming burner with just a few little holes in it, low heat on a gas
stove is never going to be that low. Look at this giant pot. That's on my smallest burner
turned all the way down, and it's still simmering that sauce way too aggressively. I had to
babysit that pot way more than I wanted to, to make sure that the sauce didn't stick to
the bottom and burn. My old electric burners, I could get way lower. And here I do need to clear up a definition
of electric. Here in the U.S., most electric burners are just a coil of wire. It resists
the current that you flow through it and it gets red hot. It's basically an incandescent
light bulb that you put a pan on. Whether that coil is out in the open or underneath
a smooth ceramic top, it's the same basic technology. This is my old glass top stove,
and it's just a wire coil under there. As I have been fortunate enough to reach a
global audience via this platform, I have found anecdotally that a lot of people in
Europe and some other places tend to assume that glass top equals induction, and that's
not true. Here in the U.S., we have lots of resistance coil stoves that are under glass
tops as well. Induction is a totally different heating technology that also is usually under
a glass top, and it's a different thing. It's a cool thing. I've got a whole video about
induction that is linked in the description. Basically, it's making heat with magnets. This little burner I have here is an induction
burner, and I'm pretty confident that induction is the future. Resistance coil stoves, even
if you get them really low or really high, they have to cycle on and off to maintain
their temperature, which gives you peaks and valleys in your heat. Plus, resistance stoves
really are unresponsive. If your pan gets too hot, you can't just turn the heat down.
There's going to be a lag during which the heat is still really, really hot on that burner
and things in your pot could burn. So in an emergency like that, you have to
move the pan off the burner, which is an easy thing to do in a domestic context since I'm
rarely cooking on every part of my stove at the same time, but I can understand why that
would be a pain in a professional kitchen. Tons of professional kitchens around the world
though are switch to induction because the heating is way more steady, the temperature
controls are way more responsive, and the stoves are much more energy efficient than
gas. Or are they? This is a really complicated topic now. I'm not talking about heat transfer
efficiency from the stove to the pot, I'm talking about energy efficiency of the whole
system. By some estimates, gas is far more efficient
in that respect, in part because you lose less energy in transmission with gas. Nonetheless,
people concerned about the environment and climate change are generally allied against
gas stoves. Depending on where you live and how your power is generated, a gas stove really
may have a lower carbon footprint, but it is inherently a carbon footprint. You are
burning a non-renewable hydrocarbon here, and it is a hydrocarbon the extraction and
use of which generates greenhouse gases. The electricity coming out of your wall socket,
well that might be coming from a fossil fuel now too, but it might not be doing that forever,
right? They could get it from some place else in the future. So surely this is one reason
why environmental groups have funded research into the various problems with gas stoves,
including their health hazards. This is a major literature review released in 2020 by
a coalition of such groups. And here, the research is pretty clear. Gas
stoves are far more likely than electric to bring potentially dangerous gases into your
home. For example, nitrogen dioxide, NO2. Research has shown that the kind of NO2 concentrations
you can get from gas cooking, these are associated with asthma and developmental problems in
kids. Nitrogen oxides smell like absolutely nothing, so you wouldn't know you were breathing
them. That rotten egg smell when you first turn on the burner? That's an additive designed
to tip you off if there's combustible gas in the room. A fiery explosion is certainly
a greater acute health risk, but odorless hazards like nitrogen oxides could be a significant
chronic health risk, especially in little kids and people with breathing problems. When I first moved into this house, it took
me embarrassingly long to discover this retractable little ventilation thing here. It's a downdraft,
because this is an island cooktop. Works pretty good. And so I've tried to get in the habit
of turning it on and using it even when I'm not making a lot of smoke and stink. When
it's just normal cooking, I try to use it anyway. And I try to cook on the back burners
closer to the vent so the stuff is more likely to go down the vent and I'm not hanging over
it as directly and breathing in the gases. Though honestly, I'm more worried about my
kids in this respect. I mean, please do not go out and replace a
perfectly good gas stove because you're worried about its carbon footprint. I'm pretty sure
wasting it and buying a new one would be way worse for the environment. But I can tell
you right now when this old girl peters out, I'm going induction. At the very least, I
think glass tops are way easier than gas to clean, but you do you.",3

My old, simpler...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.183328, i wanted to see if malted barley syrup really is the secret ingredient for bagels and i think it is look at that blistered caramel colored crust i've never gotten that on bagels before now i have a simpler bagel recipe using honey instead of malt syrup that is linked in the description if you want to get a little more involved with your bagels stay right here the very chewy new york style bagels that i miss and can't buy where i live require crazy levels of gluten development to that end i'm starting this dough with an autolyze one and three quarter cups water 415 mils bread flour which is high gluten flour water in a big bowl and into that i'll put basically as much flour as i can easily mix in i started with like four cups which is just under 500 grams i'm not needing this for the purpose of developing the gluten i'm just trying to get all the flour wet it should take like 30 seconds and i'm gonna make this little nest in the center for reasons that will soon be clear hey it already looks like one giant bagel cover with a wet towel or something to keep it from drying out and leave it for at least 20 minutes but an hour is better in that time enzymatic things happen that basically knead the bread without you even touching it you'll see okay malt syrup i have a video about what this is in the description i'm just eyeballing a couple of tablespoons you can order malt syrup online it's a specialty baker's item but i found this particular brand is also sold in health food stores weirdly i mean it's sugar but i bought it at whole foods hashtag not an ad i made an effort to get a little syrup into the belly button there to which i'll add a quarter cup of warm water 60 mls and then in goes a packet of dry yeast to bloom one sachet as the brits would say is just over two teaspoons anything in that neighborhood is fine i deliberately got some syrup in the hole to feed the yeast but not too much there is a point where too much sugar in the solution will slow them down and i'm gonna stop speeding up the footage now that is happening in real time right there i love that part it started happening after like five minutes oh we need some salt in there like a tablespoon of morton kosher for me 15 or 20 grams and then check this out the gluten is already really developed in here this is so elastic too slippery to need some more flour will help with that it'll function as whatever the opposite of a lubricant is i'm skeptical of a lot of the claims made about the autolyze or pre-soak method that we've just done but one thing it does for sure is reduce the amount of hard work you have to put into needing a very chewy bread we're halfway there already and for bagels the name of the game now is to knead in as much flour as this dough will take whatever it will absorb get it in there i got in almost two more cups my basic kneading technique by the way is really just to rock my body back and forth like i'm having a panic attack or something gather the dough up lean into it with all my weight gather it up lean into it with my palm that's a lot of force exerted without much effort okay see how sticky that still is that'd be like okay for pizza dough but it would produce bagels as flat as pancakes gotta jam more flour in there for me i actually like somewhat thinner bagels than the traditional new york style shape i use bagels primarily for egg sandwiches and a thinner one is easier to eat and fewer carbs frankly so i'm gonna stop when there's just a tiny bit of stick still left to this you want really tall bagels keep kneading until it will accept not a single particle of flour more gotta keep this from drying out while it rises but the towel could get all gummed up on there ah a dome that should keep us safe oh hey you can see me that's kind of creepy i don't like being watched but that reminds me i can kill the next hour or two on the internet much more safely with surf shark the sponsor of this video i open the app hit connect and surf shark routes me through one of their thousands of encrypted servers all over the world a virtual private network now my isp can't spy on me nor can anyone on my wi-fi network and by choosing to go through surfshark servers in certain countries i can evade government censorship or i can evade that thing where streaming companies won't let you watch something because you're not in a certain country even if you paid for it and surf shark is way more than a vpn you can turn on their clean web feature which blocks phishing attempts and malware and ads there's surf shark alert which can let you know if any of your passwords and such have been compromised there's surfshark's own search tool which has no ads or tracking while your dough is rising follow my link in the description use code adam ragusia and you'll get 83 off surf shark with an additional three months for free link and code in the description save 83 thank you surf shark okay two hours later my dough has just about doubled i'm gonna punch it down which has the effect of bringing the yeast into contact with fresh sugar to ferment and in the process of doing so i will divide this into three even chunks then divide each of those into two and then divide into again and now i have a dozen dough balls for a dozen bagels i'll form each into a reasonably smooth ball by the way if you want tall bagels you could also knead some more flour into the dough now after the first rise the flour is better hydrated now so the dough is stickier and it might accept some more flour at this stage but anyway time to just let these rest for like a half an hour nah not big enough the towel will be fine we really just need to let the gluten relax for a few minutes that'll make the bagels easier to shape while i'm waiting i'ma grease two sheet pans in the past i've had trouble with my formed raw bagels sticking to the flour or the parchment paper or whatever i put under them while they did their final rise so this time i'm going with grease so you can form bagels by pinching a hole in the center of the ball and then stretching it out today i'm doing the other method where you roll the ball out into a snake about yay long and then you wrap the snake around your hand with the ends overlapping a little bit under your palm and then you just roll against the counter to close the seam to twist the ends together surprisingly easy and effective just pull it off your hand the hole at this stage should be bigger than you want it because it's going to close up as the dough contracts a little and then it puffs up filling up that space again roll into a long snake wrap around your hand with the ends overlapping underneath roll to close the ends together having a little trouble getting it off my hands ah you know why i gotta lay the snake over above my thumb if i leave my thumb out of it that is way easier to slide off nice this method gets me something i used to love from the bagel shop i grew up with where there was a thick fluffy side to the bagel and a thinner crispier side of the bagel heterogeneity you could cook these after like a final half hour rise but i'm gonna loosely tent these in plastic just to keep them from drying out and slow rise them in the fridge probably get some better flavor this way good night take them out the next day and i'll peel the plastic off while they're still cold and firm less likely to have sticky deformations like that while those warm up a bit i'll get my boil water going it occurred to me the widest pan i own is not a pan but my big roasting tray this will give me way more room to work and you want to leave yourself plenty of height in the pan when the water gets all starchy and sugary the surface tension increases and you get big bubbles that could boil over get hot people get hot i'll mix up a little everything bagel seasoning which will just be three or four teaspoons of sesame seeds a mixture of white and black if you have some black ones this is pretty two or three teaspoons each of poppy seeds dried onion flakes dried garlic flakes and then a couple of teaspoons of coarse salt that should be just enough for a half a dozen bagels i'm gonna leave the other six plain and i'll need some egg wash and egg beaten with just a little water to loosen it up so barley syrup goes into the boil water too how much i have no idea i'm just gonna stir in enough until it looks about as brown as the water that i've seen in bagel shops something like that ah maybe a little bit more don't let it burn on the bottom there no i'm not gonna do a spoonful of baking soda in there some bagel makers do that to enhance browning but i think it just makes the bagels taste like pretzels arguably they are pretzels pretzels are bread boiled in high ph solutions that's a pretzel time to throw these in and man they are way easier to get off the greased trays without deforming them nice we can fit half a dozen in there easy you boil them for like a minute or two on each side 90 seconds in i'm gonna start flipping that's not going to work and that'll do it i have so much room to work in this roasting tray this is so much better than doing this in a big saute pan or a dutch oven i don't want greasy bottoms on my finished bagels so i'm going to lay a parchment sheet on there before i start fishing these out i've seen bakers loop them with a stick that looks cool but yeah that one broke that shape reminds me of something anyway real quick i'll just dip the tops of each of these into the egg wash and then into the seasoning mix if you don't eat eggs you can just dip the wet starchy bagel into the seasoning it'll stick just not as well i know what this looks like this looks like the engineers ship from the alien movies nice all right let's boil the plain bagels again i'm doing like 90 seconds on each side the longer you boil the chewier they will be this is i think the main difference between real bagels and prepackaged grocery store bagels those fake bagels are steamed not boiled which is cheaper for mass production but it obviously gets you bagels that are really soft and doughy these are going to be super chewy which is what i want and that barley syrup covering the crust is going to do magical things in the oven and we go 425 fahrenheit 220c convection if you don't have a convection fan i'd go a little hotter after like 15 minutes i'll rotate the pans just to make sure they bake evenly and 10 minutes after that i have amazing blistery brown crusts on the plain ones the topped ones usually need a couple minutes more just because they have a little more mass on them i do not claim to understand the science of why that maltose-filled syrup gets you a better crust than honey or other sugars i'm just happy that it does other than these being a little bit thin which i like these taste just like the new york style bagels that i grew up with in the freezer they'll go and we'll have egg sandwiches every sunday for six weeks hooray,3

squarespace malt diastatic or non-diastatic malt malt syrup malted milk powder chocolate malteds malted milk balls single malt scotch malty beers what even is malt this truly magical ingredient is at once very simple and very complex simply malt is any cereal grain that has been allowed to germinate to sprout meaning it has started growing into a new plant remember the grain that we grind into flour and bake is the seed of a grass plant that grain is malting in the field right there when grain is sprouted like that you can eat it raw or cooked and it's particularly nutritious i would bet you money that the way ancient humans first started malting grain is they took some dried grains that they had collected and they soaked them in water just to soften them up so they could chew them the grains sprouted when they got wet and then just gradually people started to realize that when the grain is sprouted like that it has all of these amazing properties for a fleeting moment sprouted grain is full of enzymes that give us all these wonderful foods you sprout the grain you dry it and then potentially do other things to it to create tons of amazing flavors if you are not familiar with the malty flavor get ready for your life to improve i'm going to show you how i made my own malt we're going to learn the science of what exactly is going on inside these seeds and how they make foods and drinks so incredible first thing you need for malt is grain and it's got to be intact whole grain that has been dried into dormancy but is still viable still alive basically i happen to have some leftover wheat from that time that i grew wheat in my backyard and baked bread with it i have two videos about that in the description wheat is not the most popular grain for making malt barley is the most popular grain for making malt for reasons that we'll get to but you can totally malt rice rye oats corn wheat any of those and my first step was to wash my wheat all the good seeds sink to the bottom what floats to the top are the dead seeds bits of chaff and other detritus that you can skim off this process may also wash away some microorganisms that could cause the grains to spoil as you leave them submerged all day ideally somewhere cool it's still hot here in tennessee so i brought the bucket inside into the air conditioning that night i drained the water out and laid the grains out onto a tray at this point they already smelled a lot like bread or beer i brought them inside and went to bed the goal here is to trick the seeds into thinking that they have just been soaked in a nice cool spring rain they are evolved to start growing into a new plant when those rains come the next day i repeated the process submerged them for a day drained them that evening and then look see that little white thing coming out there my wheat sprouted after two soaks two spring rains the water is what gets the process going that is dr nathan duncan a chemistry professor at maryville college here in tennessee where he teaches a science gen ed about beer he says it all started during his own undergrad at baylor university in texas my roommate and i were we had been interested in beard so far that sounds like literally anyone's college experience we spent a lot of our senior year brewing beer and i've been doing it ever since ah well i guess not every college kid does that nor do they all end up becoming organic chemists but anyway dr duncan was saying that soaking the seeds to a little under 50 hydration kickstarts the malting process which is you start getting water into the seed it starts activating the proteins and those cells start coming to life and they start producing uh proteins called amylases amylase that's the enzyme we've been talking about enzymes are proteins the seed is born with the amino acids necessary to build those proteins and when we get the seed wet we trigger a whole genetic process that builds proteins out of the amino acids that are in there most of us are probably more familiar with proteins that are the building blocks of tissues like muscle and skin and bone we are mostly made out of water and fats and proteins a protein like amylase is not a building block it's an enzyme because its primary function is to catalyze or start up a biological process it's a protein that we use to do something not be something in this case the seed makes amylase in order to catalyze a transformation of the starch inside the seed the fluffy white stuff in there that's the starch starch molecules are huge branches of sugars all linked together sometimes thousands of sugars in a single starch molecule and the purpose of the starches is to provide food for the growing plant until it starts producing leaves that it can start doing photosynthesis and get its own energy so that's the energy store for that plant problem is the baby plant can't eat those sugars when they are polymerized into those giant starches it uses the amylase enzyme to break those starches down into smaller or simpler sugars that it can eat most notably maltose which is a disaccharide consisting of two glucose units the simple sugars like glucose are what are needed for the cells to produce energy and so that's the process of cellular respiration so after i got my wheat sprouted i just kept spritzing it with water occasionally to keep it from drying out and i turned my pile frequently to give every seed access to air after a few days of doing that they looked like this the long spindly tendrils are the rootlets baby roots that are aiming for the ground that right there is the acrospire or plumule that's the above ground part of the plant aiming for the sky if the seeds were outside in the dirt the acrospires would eventually grow into these these are growing from seeds i lost down the drain when i was washing my wheat they got caught in my little filter under that grate and they germinated that's new wheat growing in there this acrospire is the same thing it's just not as far along with other grains this early stage of acrospire growth actually happens entirely inside the seed you have to cut one open and look inside in order to judge the acrospires growth with this wheat the acrospire is growing entirely outside the seed which is convenient for me because i need to measure how long it is when the acrospire is almost as long as the seed itself it's time for me to shut everything down if you're a plant lover it's a sad story you start the plant growing it starts to sprout and then we remove it from water to dry it out to kill the plant so that it doesn't use up all the starch effectively what we want to do is to get the process going just enough that we have a large portion of active amylase enzymes within the seed but not so much that we use up all the starch so in the babies go to dye in the oven at least that's how i'm gonna do it in scotland they dry or kiln their malt on a big floor filled with tiny holes through which they pass hot air traditionally the heat for the process was generated by burning the accumulated dead stuff from the bottom of bogs aka peat to this day some scotch whisky makers exposed their malt to peat smoke to give it a smoky taste this distillery famously uses very heavily smoked malt so it's a very heavily peated scotch it's why it tastes like an ashtray a delicious ashtray but this distillery famously does not let any peat smoke at all touch its malt and so it tastes not smoky or peady at all i love them both equally like my children but anyway i didn't have a perforated floor for kilning my malt so i just used my oven on its lowest setting and i cracked the door to allow moisture to escape and to keep the heat from getting too high in there i'm trying to make what's called a base malt your base malts are dried slowly or at lower temperature to prevent killing the enzymes once you go up to higher temperatures you absolutely denature those enzymes you'll cook them enzymes are proteins and you'll start cooking them at temperatures above 149 fahrenheit 65c high temperatures over time deactivate the amylase denature it it really gets going above 180 fahrenheit 85c at those temperatures very rapidly you are going to cook or denature the amylase and you will render it totally incapable of converting any starches into sugars which is the whole job of a base malt any maltster or company that's that's producing malts will one of the tests that they will do is a test for what they call the diastatic power of the malt and essentially diastatic power is that multiplicity to convert starch into sugar or what percent remaining amylase is present and so something like base malts have a very high diastatic power diastatic as in diastase diastase is basically an older term for amylase this malt sold for bakers has lots of active enzymes in it that's what the label is telling you and why do we want those enzymes we need the enzymes to make food for yeast in order to ferment grains into alcohol or fluffy bread dough you gotta break the starches in the grains down into sugars that the yeast can eat and ferment the yeast will not ferment anything that is more than three glucose units long and they really prefer to only ferment things that are one or two which is why to really get your bread to rise you add that teaspoon or tablespoon of sugar or a little bit of honey or something that is highly fermentable to it on top of that the bread yeast you buy have their own stores of energy inside their own little unicellular bodies just like you can store energy inside your body plus look at the ingredients on your bag of flour most bread flour and all-purpose flour at my store either has malt flour added or in the ingredients they might just list enzymes really advanced bakers add their own enzymes to bread doughs in order to create certain types of rises and certain types of effects in fact there's research indicating that chronic exposure to amylase is an occupational hazard of baking in certain people at least amylase can cause dermatitis and asthma when you're up to your elbows in flour and dough all day long bakers use amylase from malt in order to feed yeast so the yeast will make carbon dioxide and raised does brewers and distillers use amylase to feed yeast so they will turn sugars into alcohol this is a lager beer that one of dr duncan's students is working on you crush up some diastatic or base malt with other grains and you soak them in water to make what's called a mash you warm it up the amylase breaks down all the starch into sugars and then you have a sweet liquid called a wart one of the reasons barley is more popular for making malt is that it has way less gluten than wheat does so when you drain the water lauter the wart out of that big mass of grain parts when you drain it out it's going to drain cleanly if you use wheat you're going to have this glutenous sticky mass that just won't drain like corn gets really gummy too if you try to mash corn now corn you add barley to it you know that's the whole thing we can talk about bourbon for hours too but uh you know you take corn it's got starch you use the enzymes from barley or malted wheat to convert those starches into sugar but it still gets really gummy because of the proteins that are in there so that's why barley is great for making malt plus barley is really easy to grow even in really cold climates it has a nice mild taste unlike rye like rai is a really strong taste also barley is terrible for making bread because it has very little gluten in it so guess you might as well make malt with it anyway once you drain your sweet wart you add yeast to it the yeast eat the sugars and poop out alcohol and carbon dioxide and that's how you make beer or a similar liquid that you distill into whiskey or instead of fermenting the wart with yeast you could boil it down into a syrup and that's what this is malt syrup it's used to add its particular multi flavor and color to baked goods like new york style bagels but this syrup is non-diastatic meaning it does not have any enzymatic power anymore what they did was they malted some grains sprouted some grains and they let the grains convert a lot of their starch into sugar then they dried them to halt the process and also to keep them from molding or anything like that and then they turned the heat up and they roasted the grains that's what dr duncan has here a bunch of different roast levels of malt at high heat proteins and sugars have these browning reactions that make all kinds of amazing flavor compounds the grains all by themselves are delicious the lighter roasted ones taste like a milkshake so another thing to do when you're trying these malts now your saliva contains amylases crush it let your spit kind of stew on it and hold it for a second you'll notice it gets sweeter the super dark roasted malts over here taste like cocoa powder or coffee brewers use different combinations of these to make different styles of beer your base malt which is the one you simply dried that's the one that is converting all of the starches in your mash into sugar for the yeast the dark roasted malts that you add those you're doing just for flavor the darker you roast them the less enzymatic power they have they're just for flavor and color and bakers use them for flavor too non-diastatic malt powder roasted or otherwise deactivated malt ground into flour it's full of maltose which just has different chemical properties from sucrose or other sugars and it makes bread crusts really brown malt powders also end up in beverages that are the polar opposite of beer and whiskey talking about the most innocent beverage of all malted milk in the late 19th century a london pharmacist named james horlick figured that he could make an easily digestible shelf-stable drink mix for babies and sick people if he combined malt powder with milk powder and wheat flour he called his mix diastoid which was of course a terrible name for a food so he called it malted milk instead i believe some of you brits still use the brand name horlicks to refer generically to all malted milk powders even though horlicks is also a terrible name for a food but i guess that's never stopped you before malted milk became popular with outdoor enthusiasts as a preserved energy drink and because it has those delicious malty flavors it found popularity in milkshakes often with chocolate added and the malt shop here in the u.s became a symbol of mid-20th century innocence and abundance and if you bake malted milk into a hard little biscuit and then coated in chocolate you get malted milk balls whoppers which i really only know as that candy that i

Malted milk coffee cake,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/glnawqMzJBk/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLAos5W8EmchMguhfkawisSmwms6Aw,glnawqMzJBk,"5 minutes, 25 seconds",Thanks to Sensodyne for sponsoring this video! Drink coffee without fear. Brush with Sensodyne Repair and Protect with Deep Repair toothpaste twice a day to repair and relieve the sensitive...,2022-12-01 14:47:05.183328," This is an ad for Sensodyne. Man, did I find the secret ingredient to improve
my coffee cake — and no, it's not coffee. In the U.S. coffee cake refers to a cake to
be eaten with coffee, perhaps as a totally unjustifiable breakfast. The most common coffee
cake is basically like this, a buttery yellow cake with a cinnamon-flavored crumble on top
called a streusel. First step is to bring all the cold ingredients
up to room temperature. Two sticks of butter, 225g. A couple eggs and a cup of buttermilk.
In the U.S. this is a fermented milk product. You could substitute it with equal parts regular
milk and yogurt or sour cream. Gotta wait until that butter is squishy. Might
as well put some water on the boil and make a cup of coffee. Hey, maybe the steam will
warm up the butter. Coffee is a pleasure I've had trouble enjoying
much of my life thanks in part to my stupid pain from tooth sensitivity. Something really
hot or cold gets on my teeth and ZAP — these little twinges of pain. But I've got it under
control these days because I brush with Sensodyne, twice a day, everyday. Sensodyne is the #1
dentist-recommended toothpaste brand for sensitive teeth. Sensodyne Repair and Protect with Deep
Repair toothpaste is designed to repair and relieve the sensitive areas of your teeth,
when used twice a day. Its active ingredient builds a repairing layer over the sensitive
areas of your teeth and protects them from tooth sensitivity pain. Don't be afraid of
your coffee — that's no way to live. Wednesday is National Coffee Day here in the States
— get ready for it. Life’s too short for sensitive teeth. Brush with Sensodyne and
make sure this moment of your morning is the creature comfort that it should be. Thank
you, Sensodyne. OK, butter is now soft — you could do that
in a microwave on very low power. And I'll put a quarter of that into a bowl to make
my streusel. Sugar. 100g, half a cup of brown sugar — or white sugar with a dab of molasses
because that's all brown sugar is. And then 60g, half a cup of flour. Without the flour,
it wouldn't be a crumble. The the topping would just melt. And here's the secret ingredient: malted milk
powder. In the U.S. it's sold as a drink mix in normal grocery stores, usually in the coffee
isle. Half a cup, 60g of that. And I really like the streusel to be salty, so I'm going
like half a teaspoon of kosher salt there. Then, honestly, the best tool for mixing this
up is your finger tips, even if that's a little messy. It's kinda like mixing up a pastry
dough — you're looking for a heterogeneous mixture with big clumps. The color of this
doesn't look quite right — hmm. Well, set that aside and while my hands are
dirty I'll use some of my butter to grease the inside of this cake pan. It's a 9-inch
square pan, 23 cm. You could just spray the inside, but the buttery edges are gonna taste
real good. Alright, in the batter bowl with the remaining
butter. So that's a stick and half, 170g, softened. 200g or a cup of sugar. I prefer
white sugar in the batter, not brown. This way I can put in an obscene amount of vanilla
and the color will still be bright yellow. Now we're creaming the butter and the sugar
— using the abrasive power of the sugar to cut little air bubbles into the fat. You
want to keep doing this until it's really fluffy, like that. Time to crack in two eggs.
I'll beat them in one at a time, mostly to avoid splattering. Again, get that mixture
really smooth and fluffy. Time for the buttermilk — just a phenomenal
way of giving cakes a little tang and a moist, heavy mouthfeel. There's the aforementioned
obscene glug go vanilla. Maybe a tablespoon. Whip all that in, and at this point it might
start looking a little gritty, a little cottage cheesy. It'd be way worse if the butter and
eggs were still cold. Don't worry — it's gonna smooth out when we mix in the dry ingredients. Another half cup, 60g of that magic malted
milk powder. This just gives the cake an incredible, caramely depth of flavor. A couple teaspoons
of baking powder. If you don't want the acidic taste of the buttermilk you could replace
one of these with a quarter teaspoon of baking soda. That would neutralize the buttermilk
and help leaven the batter. I'm doing half a teaspoon of kosher salt,
because I'm using unsalted butter today. And I'll start mixing with just a little bit of
the all-purpose flour. Mix that smooth, and then gradually I'll mix in the rest. About
2 1/4 cups of flour total, 270g, but I think you kinda have to look at it and adjust. I
think a cake like this tastes best when it looks just a little wetter than cookie dough.
That's a little too wet. A little more flour, and there, that's perfect for me. In that goes to the pan, and some people put
in just half of it, smooth it out — and then, I'm not gonna do this, but you can make
a pretty ribbon in the middle if you sprinkle on a layer of brown sugar, maybe darken the
color with a little cocoa or ... cinnamon! That's what I forgot over here in the streusel.
Like a whole tablespoon of cinnamon. Mix that in. That's why this did't look right. No need
to get it homogenous. I think it's better if it's not. Anyway, rest of the cake batter in — super
luxurious batter. Smooth that out, and then sprinkle on that crumb. I really like to have
a few big chunks on there, so I might even squeeze some into chunks as I lay all this
down. Perfect. In we go to an oven at 350ºF/180ºC. If you
use convection you might want to take it down 10-15 degrees so the topping doesn't burn.
45 minutes later your house should smell like a Charles Dickens story — the ones about
Christmas, not murder. Not quite baked yet — look how dirty that
skewer to the center came out. This one took just under an hour. And we'll need to let
that cool all the way. Time to cut, and when it's fresh-baked, you'll notice the streusel
is hard and crunchy, almost candy-like. Personally I love that. I love the texture contrast.
It's chewy yet crunchy on top of the soft cake. But, if you wait to the next day, the sugar
will draw a lot of moisture out of the air and soften a ton. This is probably the texture
you're more used to. I like this too. And remember, they call it coffee cake for a reason.

of the time in my opinion the thigh is a far tastier quick weeknight protein and it's far easier to cook successfully we're going to talk about shopping butchering different cooking methods but first temperature thighs do not cook the same as breasts the breast is mostly fast twitch muscle fiber for sudden explosive effort this has a way more slow twitch fiber for sustained low level effort like standing around that chicken is standing on its legs and thighs and its breast isn't doing anything because chickens don't really fly this thigh muscle has to work a little all day long so it's a different kind of muscle fiber it's better vascularized meaning it's full of blood vessels big and small it's got more fat in and around it and it has more connective tissue to keep it all together it's a different substance so it cooks differently but for this demonstration i'm going to cook it the way you would cook breast real hot real fast and until a thermometer shows the minimum safe internal temperature for poultry which officially is 165 fahrenheit 74c i usually cook breast a little less than that but there's for the sake of argument 165 fahrenheit 74c pull it out that was in for 10 minutes let it rest a few minutes more and then slice if we had cooked breast to this temperature it would either be dry or on the verge of dry this thigh is not dry not in the least and it tastes okay but it's a little tough and it's really slimy the toughness is connective tissue that hasn't had much of a chance to dissolve and the sliminess is fat that hasn't had much time to render or melt thighs cooked to breast temperatures are kind of gross imho they're slimy let's do this again first thing i'll do is lower my temperature just a little bit this is just south of medium on my stove you cook it a little slower you give that fat more time to melt fat melts at a lower temperature than the heat at which meat cooks whether the skin is on or off i think you don't want to try to move or flip chicken until it releases very easily like that and you may think that skin isn't dark enough yet maybe it's not we can give it some more heat once the bottom side is ready to release but i think skin starts to taste burned at lighter colors than meat does so go easy on the skin the bottom side is about ready to release chicken is just so much more delicate than beef so you really have to let the outside solidify before you can move it around otherwise it'll stick to the pan and shred apart when you try to move it we're seared on all sides now so i can flip this kind of constantly which i think is the best way it cooks a little faster when you flip frequently and you can keep an eye on everything nothing is going to burn without you knowing it juice is starting to pool on the surface which is one of the clear signals that the inside of meat is getting cooked when i poke it it doesn't feel squishy inside anymore it feels bouncy all good signs now let's take its temperature and i'm gonna take it way past 165. this 175 which i'd consider the minimum for chicken dark meat but i really like to take it all the way to 185 fahrenheit or 85c sometimes i let it go even higher than that that was in the pan for 13 minutes is it gonna be dry i don't know does that look dry to you chicken breast cooked this hot would be the texture of chalk this is actually more succulent than the thigh we cooked 20 degrees cooler and it's more tender this is because more of the collagen in the connective tissue has dissolved into sticky delicious gelatin and more of that fat has melted so it's more moist and less slimy that is so good and to make it dinner you could just make a little pan sauce i'll soak up any burned oil in the pan and deglaze with whatever liquid i see in the fridge which today is cranberry juice sure dissolve the solids at the bottom of the pan reduce the liquid until syrupy then turn the heat off and when it's barely bubbling anymore drop in a little bit of butter just barely melt that in maybe throw in some parsley leaves and there pan sauce i usually like to use alcoholic beverages for pan sauce because a lot of the sugar has been metabolized by the yeast when you reduce down juice it tends to be super sweet yeah that is too sweet but you could use juice plus water or water plus a little sweet vinegar all kinds of things anyway that is a tasty dinner in part because it's my favorite way of butchering chicken thigh we'll talk about that right after i tell you about the maker of this fine high carbon steel pan that i've been using miesen the sponsor of this video mizin makes incredibly robust cookware for the prices at which other companies sell you featherweight garbage this is so heavy and solid but it's not ready to use yet gotta follow the instructions this is high carbon steel which is basically a hybrid of cast iron and stainless first you melt off the protective packing wax and then you season the pan just like you would cast iron this is seasoning wax which i really recommend over oil this actually smells good as it polymerizes into a natural non-stick coating beautiful and you can slide that removable handle back on if you want this pan gives you the even and rapid heating of stainless steel with the non-stick properties of cast iron pretty cool and you can get 20 percent off this pan or anything else in your first order from misen just hit my link in the description and use code ragusia at checkout you'll be doing us both a favor 20 off your first order from mizin with my link and code in the description thank you mizen okay so here's the three basic ways that you can buy standalone chicken thighs this one is skin on bone in there that is the chicken's femur in there the thigh bone that's the whole intact thigh here's boneless bone taken out the skin still on that's we've been cooking so far and here is boneless skinless that's obviously going to be the most expensive that butchering is done by hand even in big factories let's cook them side by side a little oil pepper and salt smoosh everything around intact boneless boneless skinless in the oven at like 375 fahrenheit 190c any temperature in that neighborhood will be fine half an hour later they look like this internal temperature is whoa real hot but that's fine thighs are bulletproof you can way overcook them and they'll still be good in fact i'm going to turn my broiler slash grill on to brown the tops of these a little bit more much nicer thighs are great for sheet pan dinners i'm going to take out the de-boned ones and let the bone in thigh cook a little bit longer just to put it on equal footing it's bigger it's thicker it needs a little bit more time that was like 45 minutes total much slower than the pan but way easier that boneless skinless thigh i probably cook to like 210 fahrenheit 99c internal temperature and it's still pretty soft and juicy and tasty thighs are bulletproof boneless and skin on way tastier in my opinion listen to that crisp skin [Music] unlike breasts you can cook thighs to the point where most of the subcutaneous fat has rendered out and the skin is just totally crisp awesome the bone in thigh it's easy to eat when you go to this part here and that is indeed very tasty except for that spot of burnt skin on the top bits of burned meat can taste kind of good burned skin is always gross once you start cutting in here you run into that bone and it just gets in the way it gets to be hard to eat around and there's some grossness some big hunks of cartilage some slimy blood vessels and tendons certainly easier to eat if you just pick it up but the area right around the bone is honestly a little bit undercooked and under flavored thing is it's easy to buy thighs totally intact it's easy to buy them boneless and skinless but it can be hard to find them skin on bone out so let's talk about boning them out ourselves i was reading this article in poultry science as one does about a new method of deboning chicken dislocation of articular cartilage followed by stripping periosteum the articular cartilage is the stuff on either ends of the femur where the hip and knee joints were according this article you cut through the cartilage pull it off the bone and then just pull the meat down strip the periosteum which is the tissue connecting the meat to the sides of the bones i could not make that work let me know if you can here's my method which is crude but real easy if you have one use a boning knife which is a very thin blade you can get them for cheap because they're stamped not forged stamping out a steel sheet is cheaper than forging it like you do for a chef's knife one cut down the middle right on top of the bone then one cut down along the side of the bone but not all the way through to the board just down as deep as the bone goes same cut on the other side and i'm not worrying about the ends of the bone near the joints just the middle section of the bone now i can very carefully slide my knife up underneath the middle of the bone like that in under and out the other side saw a little bit to make a bigger hole big enough that you can stick your finger through and peek it out the other side hello now get that knife in there again facing away from your finger and saw out saw out until you can push all the way through and there that's one joint free and the other is easier i just kind of lever the bone away and cut around that joint until it's free done there's some waste sure but like i said this is easy it is neither fast nor best but that's a perfect thing to freeze for stock or some such now around where the joints were there's gonna be bits of cartilage those are gross feel around for them and slice them off there will also be a few little bits of blubbery fat that won't render down all the way when you cook them they will be slimy and gross they should be right around the edge of the skin just trim them off there's that flap of skin hanging off the side not all butchers give that to you but this one did i trim it off mostly because right under where it meets the meat there's going to be another blubbery bit of fat hanging out just under the skin that tends to be slimy even after it's cooked you could cut it or even scrape it off beautiful that meat is now a super even thickness so it's going to cook evenly it's thin so it's going to cook quickly and you can flavor more of it and that skin is going to be crispy and delicious but say you don't want the skin well lift it up and you might need to reach in with your knife and open up that membrane underneath then you can just pull it off until you can't anymore at that point i just start cutting and off it comes easy i prefer skinless boneless for most wet cooking methods like stews these make an insanely quick and tasty stew i'll just cut a couple of thighs into chunks remembering that the chunks are gonna shrink in half as they cook into the oiled pan season and keep them moving to keep them from sticking to the pan or each other just stir stir stir until they're basically cooked brown on the outside and just about cooked through on the inside maybe in with some sliced shallots fry those a little bit and then time to deglaze with my old buddy white wine so good for chicken stew and i reckon baby carrots or big chunks of adult carrots will cook in about the same time that it takes for that meat to go soft cover and reduce to a simmer check on it every now and then just to make sure that nothing is sticking and the liquid isn't all evaporating if it is i'd supplement with water not more wine too much reduced wine would be really strong here we are like half an hour later everything is tender let's thicken and enrich that with a little cream super frenchy this stew is simmer the cream until thick taste for seasoning and add anything that it needs like salt drop in some fresh thyme or other herb and you could have that over egg noodles or rice or something or you could just put it in a bowl maybe mop up the sauce with some crusty bread thigh meat is so much more succulent in stews than breast meat is but let's finish this off with the easiest option you could totally just throw the whole intact thigh into a pot brown both sides just to create some flavor in there throw in whatever vaguely latin american seasonings you have fry them for a sec then just about cover everything with water reduce the heat to a simmer cover the pot wait maybe an hour until the meat feels like you could easily pull it off the bone pull those out and let them cool until you can handle them meanwhile you could drop some veggies in here and make a soup or you could do what i usually do which is boil this down to a glaze you don't need to stir it at all until it gets really thick that's when it could stick and burn because we left the skin on those thighs we dissolved a lot of gelatin out of it that sauce is going to be luscious as it is but you could augment it with a little vinegar or other acid or maybe a little honey or other sweetener and that is a super tasty coating for this chicken that will now pull off and shred when the skin is cooked wet i think it's kind of gross and i don't actually want to eat it take it off as you pull meat off the bone note the articular cartilage at the ends of the bone where the joints were nobody wants to bite into that and you can easily pull it off now that everything is cooked soft some people de-bone and shred chicken with forks i think that's crazy if you use your fingers you can feel for the bits of cartilage or unrendered fat or anything else that you don't want to eat and if you're going to be tossing this in a sauce don't shred it down all the way because it's going to shred some more as you stir it in the sauce hey there i don't know if that's a tendon or a blood vessel but i felt that it was slimy so i can take it out in that sauce it goes for my taste i wish i had reduced that glaze a little thicker but that's still gonna make for a darn tasty taco with some green stuff on top and a squeeze of lime to boot i am a thigh man all day long,3

position for me to stake out here but uh i am pro-growing enough food for everybody and i'm pro-science too this is one of the university of tennessee's experimental farms that said just because the green revolution has been a net good doesn't mean there aren't bad things about it i mean i think the internet has been a net good in the world but like have you seen it i mean yikes the green revolution sometimes called the third agricultural revolution refers to a couple of things the way that people tend to use it there's kind of a broad definition and a narrow definition under the broad definition green revolution refers to a period from the mid 20th century onward in which nearly the entire world has adopted a set of agricultural practices that have dramatically increased productivity talking about the cultivation of new high-yielding plant varieties heavy irrigation heavy use of fertilizers and pesticides often of synthetic origin and mechanization of jobs historically done by human hands or draft animals and these practices have become so widespread that now we sometimes refer to them as conventional agriculture even though historically speaking they are like the opposite of conventional but anyways this broad definition of green revolution would include the revolutions that have occurred in places like china and russia whereas the narrow definition would not the narrow definition of green revolution refers specifically to a cold war-era u.s foreign policy american diplomat william s gowd seems to have originated the term in this 1968 speech the green revolution was an alternative to the red revolution of the soviets there's this massive transfer of agricultural knowledge and technology from the united states to mexico first and then to india and then the philippines and a bunch of places where the united states was really afraid that people were going to turn to communism soon if their living standards didn't start to improve so that's the narrow definition of green revolution i'mma steer clear of that whole minefield and say that i'm referring in this video to the broad green revolution the thing that's happened pretty much everywhere and that has had obvious benefits the downside is that it really resulted in a shift in who's doing agriculture that is dr catherine zabinsky professor of plant and soil ecology at montana state university here in the u.s and she's talking specifically there about mexico the 1950s and 60s when americans introduced new seeds and new ways of growing them south of the border a lot of small older farmers couldn't afford to put in irrigation systems and couldn't didn't have access to fertilizer now look there's this romantic and rather naive notion that a lot of us have that farming has always been a totally accessible profession something that any man could do no matter how on the margins of society he was no matter how uneducated how poor he could always draw living from the earth from the ground with his own hands and provide for his family that's never really been the whole story has it since the dawn of civilization there have been elites controlling the land and who gets to farm it and who gets the profits in mexico you had the hacienda system giant farms established by spanish conquistadors they and their descendants got obscenely rich and lived a decadent urban lifestyle whilst armies of peasants in the countryside did the actual work the mexican revolution of 1910-1920 this was to a great extent about land redistribution and it succeeded to an extent in the mid 20th century you did have comparatively more people actually owning the land they cultivated and reaping the rewards but the green revolution effectively raised the barrier to entry for those farmers wasn't a system like we have here now where farmers are getting large loans to buy the chemicals the seed the equipment that they need and then based on the you know the harvest they can repay that loan back and then the next spring take out another loan so frankly a lot of people lost land because those who could afford to invest in fertilizer and irrigation could also afford so now they had higher production they could buy out or displace a lot of small-scale farmers and you know that story has been repeated in a number of places so that's an argument against the green revolution yeah we have a lot more food but we also have a lot more inequality a counter argument to that would be who cares we have a lot more food a rising tide it's raising all boats who cares if some of the boats raise a whole lot higher and a lot faster than the other ones we've got fewer people in mexico who you know are starving so i don't know yeah i'm right there with you doc though there is an argument that the green revolution has created a whole new host of health problems human health problems nutritional health problems though i suppose starvation is the number one nutritional health problem at least in terms of severity however yeah there's other things basically in the richer two-thirds of the world we now have an excess of calories cheap empty calories yielded by ultra-efficient monoculture of grains like corn or oil crops like oil palm fats and simple carbs are so cheap now and they are so easily packaged into shelf stable processed foods that are super cheap and they keep us alive but they give us a whole host of other health problems too and yeah there are health implications to the environmental degradations of modern agriculture too the animal runoff sorry y'all and then there's the agra chemicals and things like that that tend to get put under the heading of sustainability and i think that's maybe a bit of a misnomer i mean we can keep getting cancer all night long as long as we keep ourselves fed right but are we sure we can keep feeding ourselves another criticism of the green revolution is that while it may have addressed starvation which we can all agree it's not good to have people starving it also allowed for an increase in population because people had more food and it's you know we're just in this sort of rats wheel of you know how do we manage all of that indeed considering that post green revolution agriculture is dependent on non-renewable resources things that are literally going to run out at some point that's what not sustainable really means take a plane ride over the great american interior and you'll see what look like extraterrestrial crop circles those are center pivot irrigation systems giant arms on wheels that spin around spraying water much of u.s farmland is semi-arid you can farm it but you better not have a drought year if you do you get the dust bowl of the 1930s center pivot irrigation changed all of that but where does the water at the center of the pivot come up from well a lot of it comes from aquifers water soaked rock and sand deep inside the earth some aquifers fill up every year with the spring rains and the snow melt but other aquifers are what they call fossil water water that took millennia to accumulate down there and once we bring it all up is gone of course that water goes back into the environment and there's no overall shortage of fresh water in the world but that's a totally different question from whether or not you have enough water in the places where you need it it is not as yet economical to pipeline irrigation water everywhere you need it we simply use way too much of it for that at universities like this one there's all kinds of new research into these cool low water farming techniques maybe those will save the day when the time comes of course there's the tractors and the trucks and the giant cargo ships that all run on fossil fuels and at some point the oil wells will run dry geologists keep coming up with new ways to drill oil fields that were once considered inaccessible but there remains only so much dead dinosaur juice down there maybe the tractors can all run on solar panels one day lord knows there's a lot of sun out here in the fields what about the fertilizers that we put on the fields though synthetic nitrogen fertilizer is key to this new way of farming and we make most of that with natural gas natural gas is both an energy source for the process and a raw material for the process gas deposits ain't gonna last forever nor will all the other mined fertilizers like phosphorus this new farming is dependent on phosphate rocks like this some scientists have predicted that the phosphate mines could run dry really soon like this century in our lifetime it's kind of like oil where they keep discovering new deposits or new ways of accessing deposits that they thought they couldn't get to before plus people at universities and such are researching all kinds of new ways of like recycling phosphorus out of wastewater and stuff like that i don't know personally i have a lot of faith in humanity to keep inventing brilliant solutions to our problems i mean it's what we've always done but the green revolution has merely won a temporary success in man's war against hunger and deprivation it has given man a breathing space that's all says who says the father of the green revolution the american scientist norman borlaug what i just said was a direct quote from the lecture that he gave upon receiving the nobel peace prize in 1970 this is the guy who personally developed and popularized the new high-yield wheat borlaug's whole nobel acceptance speech was shockingly uncelebratory it was a plea for population control he believed population growth would eventually outpace the ability of his profession to keep everybody fed but here now the outlook has changed a lot since borlaug's day the latest united nations projections have the global population plateauing by the end of this century birth rates are plummeting in part due to the rising prosperity that people like norman borlaug helped create most of the world is getting richer getting more access to reproductive health more education and opportunities for women but you don't have to have population growth in order to have consumption growth you just have to have rising living standards and so far it seems you tend to get one or the other they are inversely proportional as population growth declines standards of living increase those are related variables more and more people all around the world are not only getting richer but they're getting to expect a richer diet like the one that i enjoy here in the united states and who the hell am i to say that they shouldn't have it but can the new agriculture feed all of us so well in perpetuity even after the oil and the gas and the phosphate in the fossil water and all the other non-renewable agricultural inputs run out can we provide these things that is only part of the question the full question is can we provide these things without wrecking much else well that's a good question too from the journalist charles mann in his book the wizard and the prophet the wizard is borlaug it's a book all about these issues and i listened to it

All thoughts and opinions...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.183328," This is a sponsored video about Ritual. What even are vitamins, and how do they get
them into a vitamin? That is, multivitamin capsules, like this
one from Ritual. Well, it’s a surprisingly complicated topic,
made more so by the fact that lots of multivitamins that I’ve seen aren’t super clear about
what exactly is in there or why. This is what I like about Ritual. Ritual tells you what they put in here and
where it comes from — they call that “traceability” — AND they explain their reasoning. Ritual
tells you why they choose to put some things in here and not others, and they back up those
choices with science. Save 10% on your first three months of Ritual supplements with my

nutrients — things we all need to consume. Some nutrients are not essential — a body
can get by without them, or a body can actually make them inside. In the case of essential nutrients, the only
way to get them is from the outside world, like from food or in some cases the environment,
like how vitamin D can come from the sun. That’s the distinction between essential
and non-essential nutrients. Then there’s the distinction between macronutrients and
micronutrients. Macros are big things — things we need to
eat a lot of, like fats and proteins. It would be very hard for me to cram my protein needs
into a little pill. If I want to supplement my intake from food, I reach for something
physically bigger — a shake, like this one from Ritual. It’s vegan, even though I’m
not, which helps me diversify my protein sources. And it’s formulated with that same Ritual
philosophy of transparency. You can see what’s in here, where it comes from, and it’s darn
tasty. It’s no pill, but it dissolves in cold liquid or in a smoothie. That’s an example of a macronutrient. Micronutrients
are things we need to consume, but we only need a tiny little bit of them. Like, under the microscope here, that is my
thumbnail, those are vitamins floating around in a Ritual capsule. Somebody like me generally
gets them from food. I’m lucky enough to have constant access to a wide variety of
fresh foods. And Ritual believes in a “food first” approach. That means they recommend
meeting most nutrient needs through a healthy, well-varied diet, and then take a supplement
to help fill nutrient gaps. Ritual has researched the typical diets of
Americans, identified potential nutrient gaps we may have, and they’ve designed their
supplements to fill those gaps. This Ritual bottle for men my age contains lots of things
I might could use a little more of — including, but not limited to, vitamins. And here we finally come to it. Vitamins are
the subset of essential micronutrients that are also organic compounds — “organic”
in the chemistry meaning of the word, not the agricultural meaning of the word. Though they do try to get their ingredients
from non-GMO sources, if that’s important to you, and they’re vegan-friendly — non-animal.
But anyway… What are all the vitamins? Well, let’s go
through them alphabetically, because conveniently they are labeled with letters. Vitamin A. Vitamin A is generally used to
encompass a group of compounds called retinoids, and here already things have gotten complicated. A particular vitamin isn’t necessarily just
one compound. There are things called vitamers — very closely related forms of that vitamin
that do the job of that vitamin in the body. In the case of Vitamin A, the job is to support
normal vision and immune function. The particular Vitamin A vitamer the folks at Ritual have
chosen for my bottle is retinyl palmitate, which is a bioavailable form of Vitamin A
that they like — it’s easy for my body to actually use it. Vitamin B. This one is even more complicated. Because what we call “Vitamin B” is actually
eight different vitamins, sometimes called the “Vitamin B complex.” These are not
different forms of the same substance that all do the same job in the body. These are
eight distinct compounds, each with its own unique structure and job to do. That’s why their alphabetical labels have
the little numbers after them — B1, B2, etc, and why you might even be more familiar
with their actual names. In the case of those two it's thiamin and riboflavin. Yes, the numbers go up to 12 even though there’s
only eight of them. Yes, that’s super confusing. Yes, we’ll talk about that another day. Vitamin B is really eight different vitamins.
Scientists have grouped them together for chemical reasons. They're all water-soluble,
for example — aka they all dissolve in water. In contrast, Vitamin A is fat-soluble, and
is best absorbed in your body with fat. They also group the B vitamins together because
those eight compounds perform interrelated roles in normal cellular functioning. But here’s the thing — a guy my age, living
where I live, I probably get most of my B vitamins just fine from food. Like, niacin — Vitamin B3 — there’s
plenty of it in a typical diet of a person like me, with or without meat. The only B
vitamins Ritual puts in my bottle are folate and B12. Folate, aka vitamin B9, is kinda like Vitamin
A in the sense that it has multiple forms, multiple vitamers. And this is where it’s
really great that Ritual tells you which form they use and why. There are some forms of folate that some people
might not be able to use, because of a common genetic variation. Ritual gets around that
by including folate in its active form. B12 is another interesting one — cobalamin.
Me, personally, I probably get plenty of it because I eat dairy and, on occasion, red
meat. But a vegan can have a really hard time getting B12. Like, nori and nutritional yeast products
are the only two non-animal foods I ever eat that have lots of B12. So, that’s why B12
is in the bottle. There’s no Vitamin C in the bottle, because
guys like me usually get more than enough ascorbic acid from food. It’s in citrus
fruit and bell peppers, for example, and in other foods that the manufacturer has fortified
with Vitamin C. Ascorbic acid supports normal immune function. But not everyone is a guy like me, and so
Ritual does put Vitamin C in some of their other formulations, like this one for postnatal
women. These formulations are backed up by research, which you can read all about on
Ritual’s website. Vitamin D is similar to vitamin A in that
it has a few distinct vitamers. Vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium, and helps
support bone health. Apropos of calcium, let’s do a tangent on
minerals. Not all essential micronutrients are classified as vitamins. Some we call minerals
instead. Why? Well, because they’re not organic compounds.
They’re elements — things from the periodic table. They’re not vitamins, but they are
essential micronutrients. And guys like me might not necessarily get
enough of some of them, so they’re in my multivitamin even though they’re not vitamins. Also in my multivitamin is Vitamin D3, cholecalciferol,
which helps my body to absorb the calcium I ingest. Vitamin D can be obtained through sun exposure
as well as from food. Data from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey show that many Americans are not getting enough vitamin D from diet.
I probably get a lot of Vitamin D from milk products, which are commonly fortified with
Vitamin D. But again, if you don't do milk, that can be a problem. Ritual sources their
Vitamin D from sustainably-sourced lichen, rather than from animal sources. Whether that
matters to you or not, isn’t it nice that they come out and tell you? Then there’s Vitamin E, which is a fat-soluble
antioxidant. It’s found mostly in nuts and seed oils but also occurs in some fruits and
vegetables. Ritual gets theirs from rapeseed oil instead of soy, if you’re avoiding soy
— or even if you don’t care, isn’t it nice that they tell you. The last vitamin is K, which is important
for normal blood coagulation (clotting), and it supports bone health. The particular form Ritual puts in this bottle
is Vitamin K2, menaquinone. Again, that’s one that vegans may have a hard time getting
from food, plus it’s a form that lasts longer in the body. Again, isn’t it nice that all
of this is on the website, down to the factory in Norway where they make it? What happened to vitamins G-I? Why does it
skip from E to K? That’s a funny and long story that we’ll tell another day. But some people do say “Vitamin F” to
refer to two essential omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, even though the U.S. government
does not actually classify them as vitamins. Fat is considered a macronutrient, not a micronutrient,
and therefore not a vitamin. But one so-called “Vitamin F” that Ritual
does put in my mutli is Omega-3 DHA. This is a fatty acid that supports brain and heart
health. And they get it from microalgae, not fish so it’s vegan. Remember, Ritual is vegan-friendly, non-GMO,
gluten-free, major allergen-free, no artificial colorants. And Ritual mails them right to your door so
you never fall off the multivitamin wagon. The packaging is made with 100% recycled materials,

Broccoli in garlic sauce | incidentally vegan | Chinese-American inspired,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xt5zzI_3-VA/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLCwwxykNFcMQ5fo6ywSdNMet5ZHvw,Xt5zzI_3-VA,"7 minutes, 22 seconds",Thanks to Morning Brew for sponsoring this video! Sign up here https://cen.yt/mbadamragusea9 for your free daily newsletter — I’ve really enjoyed Morning Brew and I think you will too!...,2022-12-01 14:47:05.183328, broccoli is unsurpassed as a sponge for sauce and god i love a sweet glossy chinese-american restaurant-style garlic sauce this is a really easy and cheap meatless meal incidentally vegan the way i'ma do it please don't take this as traditional chinese this is just me riffing off of the strip mall restaurant classic i love first thing is get like half a cup of rice going 100 grams that's enough for me and lauren but you might want more wash and drain wash and drain a few times to get off the free starch coat if you want fluffy chinese style steamed rice i'll throw in like 1.75 times the rice volume in plain water no salt for this style of rice heat on high and today i'm trying this method i've heard of where you don't cover it at first you just bring it to a boil and let it cook until the surface gets pockmarked like that the rice is peaking up above the water level now you cover take the heat down and let it steam for like 15 minutes or really until this dinner is ready it'll be quick it's a garlic sauce so three to four cloves of garlic peeled and i'll peel a little thumb of ginger about as much as the garlic i always start by slicing ginger across its fibers against the grain that makes it easier to chop fine later and you can skip this but i'm doing a little fresh chili maybe half of it chop all that up pretty fine man does that combination smell good in a little dish and set that aside my beloved chrissy teigen pan it's a steep sided saute pan if you don't have something like this i would use like a little soup pot or a dutch oven you need something tall with a lid just an inch of water in there and these expandable steamer baskets are the best they're cheap they're compact and they fit any pan lid on heat on high if you don't have a steamer you could boil the broccoli instead of steaming it one medium to large crown like this will feed two stand it upside down and that way it's really easy to go around and cut off perfect little florets once you get down to the tip the individual florets are too small so i just cut off the whole thing and trim it into like three or four bites the stem you can cut into slices and cook with everything else or not then it's just a matter of cutting the biggest of these in half or maybe thirds bigger pieces will look prettier and remember they're going to shrink a bit so i say go big water is boiling so in goes all the broccoli you can pile it high in the basket the steam will come up through everything cover and cook in my opinion just three minutes that's just enough time to fill a big bowl with water and chuck in some ice cubes i want to pull these before they are fork tender though you can use a fork to lift out the whole basket and sploosh into the ice bath stir it around until every piece is cooled off blanching and shocking like this is really popular in restaurants because we have deactivated the enzymes that turn green into brown the texture is one tiny step away from perfect and it'll stay perfect in the water there for hours if you need it to we have zero rush now we are gonna need like a cup of water or stock for the sauce and hey i've got this broccoli water right here i'll admit it's not the best brew i've ever had morning brew is way better the sponsor of this video morning brew is a free daily newsletter covering the latest in business finance and tech i've been waking up to it for a year they give you your stocks and briefly explain what the numbers actually mean then it's just super tight story summaries that respect your time and intelligence often funny facebook but for your face seriously facebook is making ray bans with computers and oh a food story jp morgan is buying zagat which is basically the american michelin guide i guess bankers love restaurants and i love how morning brew bullets out all this text making it skimmable i'm read up in five minutes it takes 15 seconds to sign up for morning brew with my link in the description it's totally free there's no catch just use my link thank you morning brew all the water is out of my pan so i can put the heat back on like medium and there's my sauce ingredients just a little plain old cooking oil just to film just to fry the garlic chili and ginger for a minute just until it's soft and starting to go golden before it burns in goes the 240 mils or one cup of water broccoli water could be plain water could be stock but i don't think stock would make a big difference with all these much stronger flavors going in i'm using like a teaspoon of onion powder not necessary but nice definitely need the soy sauce i'll start with like a quarter cup 60 mils most chinese garlic sauce recipes call for vinegar and some call for ground mustard seed well guess what this is a couple of teaspoons of any tangy mustard traditionally you'd get more umami and some gooey texture from a giant glug of oyster sauce yes it really is made with oysters you could do that or a fish sauce i'm gonna go back to my old british buddy marmite a giant spoonful of this it's a yeast extract so it's vegan if you're into that it's really nutritious it's got your b vitamins that are hard to find without animal products it brings a wallop of umami and tons of glossy gelatinous texture i love this as a sauce ingredient just don't expect me to spread it on my toast brits time for sugar the oyster sauce would have brought sugar and most garlic sauce recipes call for even more some honey or some brown sugar i'm starting with like a tablespoon of white sugar and a glug of molasses because sugar plus molasses is all brown sugar is and i actually want more molasses than is normally in brown sugar i swear this sauce will not taste like a gingerbread house it's gonna taste like chinese food a teaspoon or two of toasted sesame oil just for flavor very strong stuff i tried putting this in at the beginning and frying the garlic mixture in it and it burned every time it made the sauce bitter save it to the end i'll grind in some pepper you can maybe do a little dash of chinese five spice if you have it time for thickener cornstarch or any refined starch maybe a couple of tablespoons whoops that's a little too much but it's good to have some extra ready to go and mixed into a slurry put in just enough cool water to where you can dissolve it by smashing it up with your finger well technically it's not dissolving the starch granules are merely dispersing through the water and they'll sink down to the bottom if you let this sit for more than a minute okay sauce is simmering one hand stirs while the other hand drizzles in the slurry if you don't stir as you drizzle you'll get giant starch globs that'll be really hard to break up and if you just threw dry corn starch in the pan it'd instantly form huge lumps i'll hold the rest of my slurry in reserve there that may seem extremely thick already but we can always water it down and the broccoli is going to release some water into this and thin it out heat down the sauce can very easily stick to the bottom and burn when it's this thick have a taste and remember this needs to be strong enough and salty enough to flavor itself all the broccoli and all that plain unseasoned rice it should be too sweet too sour too salty too umami i'm gonna reach for some good old msg that's the brand name that it's sold under here in the states accent this is the traditional thing you could put in plain salt if you want but either way get the sauce really salty if it needs more acid put in more mustard or vinegar if it needs more sugar do it all we got to do now is reheat the broccoli i'll gather that up wring out as much water as i reasonably can and in it goes it'll cook and soften that last little bit that it needs as it warms up in here and gets coated yeah that sauce is too thick to splash in some water not too much i still want it pretty gloopy i don't know i'm not sold on this bring the rice to a boil uncovered thing that's pretty dry maybe i should have started with more water that's fine notice how bright green the broccoli is and it's going to stay that way for a while because we blanched and shocked it if we had just stir-fried it it'd be gray by now and i think steamed broccoli has a brighter fresher flavor got a spoon over that excess sauce to flavor the rice and if you have some whole sesame seeds in the cupboard hey why not i think broccoli is totally substantial and meaty enough to be a main ingredient if you don't overcook it if it still has a lot of snap really satisfying to bite into especially when it's coated in meaty sugar glaze meatless meaty sugar glaze at that,3
The ethics of hunting deer for meat,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C_uC2YfFzps/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLAojlbWaki1tmFdSgLTo9nGqAhK1Q,C_uC2YfFzps,"10 minutes, 27 seconds","Thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this video!

squarespace is it okay to hunt animals for their meat that might seem like an absurd ethical question from the mouth of a meat eater and indeed maybe it is absurd i mean i eat the meat of domestic animals all the time assuming i've erected an ethical framework that allows for killing chickens on a farm would not that same framework allow for killing deer in a forest it should right i mean most chickens live their whole lives in buildings like these at least deer get to run around outside before we eat them and yet i confess a certain moral discomfort with hunting i grew up in rural central pennsylvania where lots of the other guys hunted every season i never did and i suppose looking back on it my problem with it wasn't so much with the act itself but rather the the enjoyment of the act it's kind of like proctology you know colorectal surgeons i'm really glad there are highly trained physicians who specialize in human butts i may need a butt doctor one day but it is kind of weird that at some point in this person's training they thought to themselves wow you know what i'd really like to do for the rest of my career i'd like to treat problems that are up people's butts similarly i'm very very glad that there are people who want to raise kill skin guts animals and cut up their meat for my consumption i'm just a little bit suspicious of people who would do that for fun but if i'm honest there's a class dimension here i may have grown up out in the woods but i was not a rural kid i'm the child of educated urban professionals who commuted to and from the woods hunting was the hobby of the kids who actually lived and worked on those farms my folks commuted past every day compared to me those farm kids i shared a school bus with were less removed from the days when people had to hunt as a means of survival whether i was aware of it or not my pointed asshule of recreational deer hunting was an expression of status and a rather obnoxious one at that no people in my cast we do not dirty our hands with that unpleasantness you peasants you go out and have fun in the woods with your guns but now as an older and hopefully wiser man my attitudes are quite different i'm trying to spend more time outside and i'm trying to get closer to where my food comes from those two goals point to hunting as logically as they point to gardening so i'm back to my original question is it okay to hunt animals well obviously that's gonna depend on the animal right like i'm pretty sure that sniping some endangered apex predator from the comfort of your land rover just to somehow prove how tough you are that's one of the douchiest things a human being can do but what about like white-tailed deer here in north america scientists believe they are probably at their pre-columbian population levels these days hardly endangered this may be because humans have killed so many of the deer's natural predators or because we've chopped up the forests and created lots of places where trees meet grass deer thrive on those edges nobody knows for sure but they are just good at being alive and can increasing their population that is tess gingery she is a wildlife biologist who actually did her master's thesis at penn state chomping around in the woods where i grew up studying deer populations hey how'd she get into the big game game that's an interesting question i grew up with firearms my dad was really into the american revolution so i grew up with like black powder muskets and so i was comfortable around firearms but not hunting we didn't we weren't hunting family i grew up in salt lake city utah so more of like a city urban upbringing um and went through periods of veganism vegetarianism came to pennsylvania and got deeper into kind of just the large mammal world and the research and kind of worked through some of my you know like how i felt about things and read the research and stuff and i actually have i harvested my first year last year so it was nice that i was comfortable with firearms because i trusted myself to make a good shot a good shot that is a shot that kills the animal quickly thus sparing it much suffering assuming they were talking about hunting an animal that has a healthy population and assuming that we're actually going to eat it and not just hang its dismembered head on our wall to impress our douchey friends well then i think the ethical question of hunting hinges primarily on whether or not we can provide the animal with a quick painless death but then again quick and painless compared to what well this is actually what gingry researched in grad school how deer normally die specifically fawns the babies about half of the fawns in her study groups survived to six months kind of went out and caught fawns and put collars on them that we could track their movements and when the caller remains motionless for four hours uh it sends a signal that says hey i'm probably dead so we go to that individual and um sometimes they're not dead they just spring up and we're like okay you were just like really taking a long nap but uh usually there you know there is a carcass there and so that's like a csi field investigation right like gloves on like hair pulled back and taken pictures and before you touch the carcass you're taking a lot of pictures of the area and you're looking around for any signs of predators and indeed predation was the number one cause of death among the fawns in gingrich's two study groups that's consistent with prior findings going back half a century in pennsylvania we see a kind of a mix of black bears and coyotes as like your top main predators but if you're looking at overall probably i think coyotes are the number one predator for like if you're looking at the entire range of whitetail deer black bears coming in at a second and bobcats are kind of like a those are the big three we would say as you can imagine the big three generally do not hit the deer with a good shot but that's young deer studies that look at adult deer find that human hunting harvest well that's the number one cause of death so right after harvest comes vehicle collisions fun story when i was 17 i was driving through a snowstorm and i came over a blind hill and there was a deer i swerved to the left i over corrected to the right and the next thing i remember is the smell of airbags lots of people have similar stories but theirs often end with a game warden coming out a half an hour later to put an end to the deer's suffering my dear got away um and then after that after you see those human sources you kind of come down into disease and then starvation and then predation so if tess gingery were a deer knowing everything she knows which way out would she choose i mean i would choose being harvested because i mean a lot of the time when you're being harvested let's say you might be as a deer you might be shot and you would have no idea that it was coming and it's a quick death with a good shot and with a predation you're kind of being chased you know if you're if you're going to look at a deer as if it was a human with human emotions which is totally fine but if you're looking at it that way then that's how i would separate it i would rather kind of not know what's coming and that's so i would rather be harvested than predation because it can be quite the chase and it can not be as instantaneous sometimes so yeah now i know what some of you are thinking you're thinking false choice it's not just between dying from predation and dying from hunting couldn't a deer just die happily of normal old age if like old age so deer like eat and they grind their food kind of so they grind their teeth away so if a deer was to escape all the bad things out there in the woods what might happen is they would starve to death because they wear their teeth down so much that they can't eat anymore so that would be a natural cause of like old age death in a deer now you might be saying you might be saying so what so what if basically all animals meet horrific deaths in the wild that is nature and we have no right to interfere just because we want a nice saddle of venison well i think that is a perfectly cogent argument but broadly speaking responsible hunting probably does not increase animal suffering at least not in animals like deer it may even do the opposite if you have too many individuals in the population what's going to happen to those deer well you're going to see a lot an increase in vehicle collisions likely so you're kind of swapping one death for a different type potentially right but you're also likely going to see an increase in diseases if you have a lot more individuals in the population diseases are easier to swap as they get closer and closer to each other you want to see a real horror show google chronic wasting disease in deer or prion disease it's thought to be caused by a prion which is basically a defective protein this disease turns deer into starving zombies and it may be exacerbated by people trying to feed deer if one infected deer stumbles up to a feeder it is far more likely to spread the disease to other animals than it would grazing on wild food as with most big topics in food ethics hunting is way more complicated than it may seem a much easier choice is what you should use to build

""Why I no longer...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.183328, this is a sponsored video about crowd cow if you eat meat and you want to make sure it was raised responsibly the easiest thing you can do is look for a label like organic free range antibiotic-free for example labels can be useful but they have their limitations for myself as a consumer i tend to think the best strategy is to find specific farmers and ranchers whom i know and whom i trust to make smart conscientious decisions out there crowd cow is an online meat market the express purpose of which is to help us find those farmers and ranchers so we can buy awesome food from them as you browse crowd cow you'll find that some of the product is usda certified organic but not all of it is and why isn't it all organic well here's one example one day joe heitzberg was out in montana checking out a really big cattle ranch thousands of acres joe is a co-founder of crowd cow and he was out in montana helping a rancher mend fences no i don't mean make peace i mean literally mend the fence that keeps the cattle in the right pasture so we're way out there and he pulls out uh one of the fence posts and he says well this is why we're not organic and he chucks it into a pile and i said what do you mean you're not organic and he said well these are treated wood uh fence posts and so we can't be organic now that is not as crazy as it sounds to keep wood from rotting outdoors you have to pressure treat it and those chemicals do leech into the environment and potentially end up in the food that's a real thing and can be a real problem in certain situations but treated fence posts out on giant ranches are hardly the biggest problem in our food system and ranchers have to balance their use against other very important interests to use untreated wood they'd have to chop down a forest of trees every year and replace all that fence every year and so i said well if you ever do become organic let me know because we don't want to sell your beef now we do not offer that example as an indictment of the usda organic program joe will tell you in his opinion it's one of the better certification standards that are out there unlike many other labels usda organic is actually spelled out in exhaustive detail by a government authority and the standards are enforced by inspectors but it's just the nature of the beast that when you make policy you have to draw arbitrary lines and you don't always draw them in exactly the right place for every situation plus there is legitimate debate over what exactly is right i had a farmer that was um complaining to me she was down a dirt road four hour drive kind of middle of nowhere and she was not qualified for an anim a certain animal welfare standard why not well because she spays her cows surgically sterilizes them there are humane ways to do that no doubt historically some less humane methods have been used and this particular animal welfare certifier says no spaying why do you need to spay your heifers she said well out here i've got again range land so they go miles and miles away and if they're not spayed and the neighbor's bull hops the fence and they get pregnant that's a real big problem out here because i can't support uh the heifer giving birth way out there and if something goes wrong and that's that's an animal welfare issue right for me people who make food have to make a lot of choices and every day that i make food videos for you i become less and less confident that i know what the right choices are these things are super complicated and debatable what i want is to buy food from people who are at least thinking about these things people who are trying to balance human animal and environmental welfare with the need to turn a profit i'm talking about people like larry tebben here he raises american wagyu beef in south texas you can buy his stuff on crowd cow you want to look for a product that's basically antibiotic free notice that he said basically we use it we you know we hardly ever have to use an antibiotic and if we'll do that to save a calf's life if we can to get sick with pneumonia or something like that farm animals are just like us sometimes they get super sick and when that happens yeah you give them medicine the problem with antibiotics is their overuse lots of producers use antibiotics prophylactically rather than providing the animals with a healthy environment and a healthy diet like this you just load them up with drugs to prevent illness that may or may not even strike other producers also use antibiotics to make the animals grow faster the precise mechanism of this is something that scientists are still working out but one possibility is that you give the animal antibiotics even when they're not sick and what happens is food energy that the animal takes in goes to tissue growth instead of maybe getting diverted into normal immune function hey boosting productivity is great if you can get more food out of the same animal in less time then that's probably good for sustainability but there is a specific problem with overusing antibiotics things build up a resistance to antibiotics and then also i believe there's some evidence that shows that the antibiotics aren't completely out of the animal or the egg or whatever when the meat's processed so yeah antibiotics may be a problem but i am wary of some of the antibiotic-free labels that are out there because i want them to allow for flexibility i want farmers to be able to use medicine when appropriate i don't want rigid adherence to orthodoxy what i want is somebody to just be out there making good judgments judgments that generally align with my values as a human being on this planet so what is a conscientious consumer to do get to know beyond the issues beyond the labels who are the people raising the animals how did they get into it was their history why are they doing it and what are some of their practices that they're doing to adapt their own heritage breed or local ecosystem that are unique to them those things are really special really valuable to you as a consumer and aren't covered by any label program honestly one thing that i often do is look to see if a small farm has like a vigorous social media presence if an actual human being an actual farmer is out there posting a lot with pride about all the things that they do and why that's usually a pretty good sign the problem is that most farmers are old and that's actually in and of itself a whole other problem that we should talk about another day generational succession in farming but anywho most small independent farmers are like older folks who are not super savvy with the internets and you're not going to be able to find them on social media so much so crowd cow is a really good way to find them so for anything we do we're looking for equality an assortment stories connection back to the farms and and one click away to a blog post where if you want to go as deep as you as you feel like it you can go all the way thanks for your work at crowd cow joe and thanks to crowd cow for

Free shipping within the U.S. Financing...,2022-12-01 14:47:05.183328, here's a simple practical way to make baked alaska which is this 19th century fancy pants restaurant dessert of cake and ice cream layers baked inside a dome of meringue yes baked ice cream what i'm going to show you is way easier and i think better first the cake i've got a nine inch square cake pan 23 centimeters you could do these quantities in a bigger pan but not a smaller one we're gonna fill this past the brim which is one reason i'm being sure to get plenty of excess when i cut out a parchment square and then i'll snip diagonals into the corners those slits will help the paper lay snug inside the pan it doesn't have to be a perfect fit but if you see little bits that are going to curl into the cake you can just snip those off that's good enough grab a little mixing bowl and i'll put in half a cup of cake flour maybe 60 grams all-purpose flour would be okay about one and a quarter cups of powdered sugar maybe 150 grams you could use granulated sugar instead it'd be about three quarters of a cup if you did that half a cup of cocoa powder 50 grams i'm using dutch cocoa but natural be fine if you want a yellow cake instead just replace the cocoa with more flour that substitution doesn't always work but it will with a dense cake like this a teaspoon of baking powder a small pinch of salt now time to separate four eggs i'll just crack them into a bowl and fish out the yolks the whites will need to make our meringue and instead of making the cake a more traditional sponge cake which would also require whites i'm gonna use these yolks to make a very rich devil's food cake this way no egg goes to waste throw those whites in the fridge for later more wet ingredients for the cake i'm doing half a cup of greek yogurt like 140 grams you could use sour cream instead 1 3 of a cup of milk 85 mils water or coffee would be fine instead then lastly half a cup 120 mls of any neutral cooking oil mix and mix well real fast for a few minutes just to get some bubbles started in there my goal with these ingredients is to get a cake with a lot of protein a lot of liquid fat and not much water why because the cake is going to be frozen i don't want it icy hard when i bite into it oops i forgot the vanilla big splash of that anyway the high protein and high liquid fat content will give us a pudding like consistency when it's cold butter and solid chocolate would lock up real hard in the freezer now that it's nice and smooth i'll pour it into my cake pan the weight of the batter will help keep that parchment in place and we go to the oven at 350 fahrenheit 180c how long depends on many factors i'd say start testing after 20 minutes to see if a skewer or a knife or something comes out of the middle clean i want to give this another few minutes i'd air on the side of it being a little overcooked since it's going to soak up some moisture later from the ice cream let that cool on the counter for a bit looks as soft and cushy as my mattress from helix the sponsor of this video helix is a premium mattress in a box company we actually have two the king size we sleep on and the queen we put here in the guest room my folks came and stayed with us and i swear this is true my mom came downstairs and said where'd you get that mattress it's so comfortable you just go to helix's site tell them how you and any bed mates like to sleep side stomach super firm whatever and helix suggests a model for you it literally comes in a box under vacuum compression break the seal and you might think it would be really soft and squishy and they have super soft ones if you like that but this one is quite firm and solid it's a real very high quality mattress i find both our helixes support my back better than our old mattress i sink in just enough and then it supports you can pay as little as a dollar a day with a special financing plan they're offering until september 19th however you pay click my link in the description and get up to two hundred dollars off your helix plus two free pillows you also get a hundred night sleep trial along with a 10 year warranty helix sleep dot com slash ragusia thank you helix anyway let that cake cool a bit and then transfer to the freezer we need it real firm when we smear the ice cream on top at least half an hour in there i'd say at some point you want to take out your ice cream i need two of these pints to cover that cake leave them out until they're just squishy we need the ice cream soft but not melted on it goes to the cold cake layer in blobs i'm doing strawberry flavored so i get this neapolitan ice cream vibe chocolate strawberry and vanilla layers but obviously you can use any flavor you want since we laid it in blobs it's already pretty even now so i don't have to do very much to smear this solid since the cake is cold it shouldn't be damaged by this but i'm still being pretty gentle back in the freezer with that to harden up the ice cream layer during which time i can make the meringue get a little pot and a big heat tolerant mixing bowl egg whites go in there in the pot goes a cup or 200 grams of granulated sugar plus half a cup of water 120 mils also a squeeze of corn syrup if you have it honey would work too and get that boiling on high heat in the egg whites goes half a teaspoon each of cream of tartar and corn starch and get it beating you could use a little squeeze of lemon or a dash of vinegar instead of the cream of tartar and you can use any starch not just cornstarch these additives will serve to stabilize the foam keep it from collapsing or squeezing out water no need to stir the pot over there the squeeze of corn syrup makes it virtually impossible for that sugar to crystallize as it cooks get the egg whites to stiffish peaks like that and when the syrup hits about 240 fahrenheit 115c it's time to very carefully drizzle it into the eggs as we whip please be careful hot syrup is dangerous once you've got half of it in you can dump in the second half much faster and keep whipping i would never bother doing this without an electric mixer of some kind the side of the bowl feels quite hot now we're making italian meringue which is a pre-cooked meringue it does not need to be baked the hot syrup cooks it and gets you a marshmallowy vibe in fact this is often called marshmallow cream or marshmallow fluff marshmallow cream is italian meringue when it's glossy and doesn't seem to be getting any fluffier it's done but i'm continuing to whip it to cool it down i don't want it so hot that it melts the ice cream but i still need it a little warm if it's not warm it'll be impossible to spread it's perfect when you can touch it and it feels just a little warm now you can whip in a little splash of vanilla without evaporating much of its flavor i've got a little pinch of salt in there too just for taste whip that in out comes the pan again and very quickly before the meringue starts to set up scrape it all in there and smooth it out to an even layer you can see why this is the smallest size of cake pan that'll work for these quantities and the parchment has to be going all the way up in the freezer again to harden at least a couple hours but here we are the next day grab a cutting board and now you can very easily lift the whole thing out with the paper the sides of the paper should peel off real easy and now we can slice if you have a long sharp carving knife that would be best whatever the knife wipe it down after each cut if you want really clean edges i think if you cut this into six pieces those are pretty good portions last thing to do is brown the meringue like it would have browned in a very hot oven traditionally this is a cheap little fire stick it does okay but it takes a little while if you have a kitchen torch or are a welder by trade that's gonna be a lot quicker i love how the warm and toasty marshmallow on top contrasts with the cold ice cream and the cake is firm but not icy it's chewy and solid enough that you can lift the whole piece to your mouth without it breaking apart another alternative to the torch would be to douse the cake in a very high proof spirit turn off the lights and carefully ignite with the fire stick or a long match this is a trick that would have worked great in old-fashioned fancy restaurants because they were so dark if the lights are on you can't really see the flame so there you go bring some retro kitsch to your next dinner party it really isn't that hard,3

I filmed the growing...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.183328, this is gumbo no not that i mean this is gumbo or possibly this either the green powder there or the green vegetable one of those is probably where the name gumbo came from i mean sure why not name your culture's beautiful classic stew recipe after the ingredient that gives it the texture of snot mucilage both okra and this filet powder here are filled with mucilage a word that shares its etymology with mucus because it is the plant kingdom's equivalent of mucus plant snot is one of the traditional thickeners in gumbo and it's likely the origin of gumbo's name we're gonna talk about what exactly mucilage is and why you would put it in your food i mean a lot of people love it i love it on occasion but first what even is gumbo the stew not the ingredient gumbo it is often observed is the edible embodiment of the great american state of louisiana and its particular mash-up of cultures louisiana is super different from the rest of the united states because history here in the u.s we all live every day with the legacy of english-speaking colonists in this land that legacy is coming out of my mouth right now even though i personally am not descended from any english-speaking colonists as far as i know we also live with the legacy of spanish-speaking colonists especially in the southwestern part of the country but it wasn't just the brits and these spanish slash portuguese who left their muddy boot prints all over the hemisphere it was also the french and in the u.s we can kind of forget about french america we just don't feel that legacy every day the way you do up in canada or down in the francophone caribbean the big exception is louisiana named after i don't know one of the french kings named louis there were like 35 of them the french established an american beachhead around the mouth of the mississippi river and extended their theoretical claim northward to the point where it merged with their other north american beachhead in canada those were once on paper at least the same place over the course of mostly the 18th century the following people came to louisiana and dropped their ingredients in the stew i'm now synthesizing the work of many different food historians they're linked in the description of course there's the french who brought the roux you take your flour and you mix it with enough fat to make a paste and you cook it in the case of gumbo you cook it a lot stirring constantly so it doesn't burn after 20 minutes of stirring my wrist is toast i'm calling that done even though that is probably the minimum darkness they'd consider acceptable in new orleans i've seen dark rooves for gumbo that are almost black this is the texture and flavor base of the stew now the french brought the first african people they'd enslaved to louisiana in 1708 first from the french plantations in the caribbean and then directly from west africa also brought from africa via the slave trade was the okra and the rice often served with gumbo worth pointing out that rice is probably a bit of a later innovation the people who invented this stew probably didn't have access to rice or at least not very much rice if you had a lot of rice you could just thicken the stew with rice rice was expensive in 1721 a group of germans settled near new orleans and they brought sausage though the common sausage used in gumbo today has a french name and dewey the french versus german origin of this stuff is a subject of debate in 1763 the french ceded louisiana to the spanish it was part of the settlement of the seven years war spanish settlers in particular ones from the canary islands may have brought some of the spices and the peppers even though ironically peppers originated in america in the first place and they also probably brought the shellfish also a result of the seven years war the great expulsion the brits expelled french settlers in what are now the canadian maritime provinces and the spanish allowed them to resettle in louisiana these people were known as acadians which eventually became cajuns there's hypothesis that gumbo came about from cajuns trying to recreate their traditional fish stew their bouya base with louisiana ingredients problem is there's evidence that gumbo or something like it was already happening in louisiana long before the acadian expulsion seems to me both things could be true the cajuns might have developed the pre-existing recipe a bit with their bouillabaisse techniques to this day some people draw a distinction between cajun gumbo and creole gumbo creole in this context is this kind of vague word that refers to people who descend from the french or spanish colonial periods of louisiana and these are generally people of mixed heritage and sometimes cajun is considered a subset of creole sometimes not i don't know all i know is that it took me like four hours to cook this not really a family recipe suited for contemporary life for that i turned to hellofresh the sponsor of this video hellofresh is america's number one meal kit delivery the mind boggles at the number of cultures represented in this box shwarma spiced chicken and rice let's do it i know how to cook but i still cook from hellofresh recipes all the time they're very tasty they introduce me to new ingredients and techniques and i don't have to plan them i don't have to shop for them everything comes pre-portioned i have to worry about how i'm going to use the rest of the yogurt that i bought for this one recipe they only sent me what yogurt i would need for this one dinner it's less stress less waste even with the packaging a meal like this is greener because of the reduction in food waste says a university of michigan study

meals plus free shipping link and code are in the description adamergucia14 thank you hellofresh now all the while newcomers accumulated in louisiana like so many gumbo ingredients there were of course people who already lived there it was probably choctaw speaking native americans who brought the filet powder the dried and ground leaves of the sassafras tree this is the third thickener used in gumbo often scattered on right at the table tastes kind of like tea spiked with root beer root beer was originally made from the bark of the sassafras root that is until people found out that the oils in sassafras are carcinogenic there's only trace amounts of oil in the leaves though they're fine and watch what happens if you boil them wait for it wait for it wait for it there mucilage it's full of mucilage which you can dry out reconstitute with hot water and it forms a gel that traps water and thickens the liquid kind of like starch but the texture is much more slippery i also kind of reminds me of like raw egg whites like a protein is mucilage a carbohydrate like starch or is it a protein like egg yes and yes it's a glycoprotein a carb stuck to a protein mucilage is made by virtually all plants it has a structural role in membranes it's used for energy and water storage in the plant carnivorous plants even use it as fly paper it's sticky choctaw and other indigenous people used sassafras and its mucilage for all kinds of things for medicine but also for thickening soups whereas starch makes soups kind of gluey mucilage makes them kind of stringy ropey the french called sassafras powder filet filet as in filament the soup falls in threads filet that's what the french called it what did the choctaw call it combo which sounds an awful lot like gumbo and may indeed be the origin of the name of course there's another source of mucilage in gumbo and that is okra you can see it growing here in the garden okra is the edible seed pod of a plant in the mallow family related to the marshmallow from which marshmallow was originally made check out its creepy flower buds here they are a few days later opening up okra may have originated in south asia it may have originated in africa but it definitely got to louisiana from west africa enslaved west africans were very familiar with growing okra and using it as a base for soups the ton of mucilage around the seeds it plays an important role in seed germination mucilage traps water up against the seed which is really useful for plants adapted to dry climates cactus is full of mucilage you can see here when i drop the okra into the gumbo almost immediately the texture changes it becomes ropey lots of people associate this texture with mucus and therefore with illness but in west africa where they've been cooking with okra for millennia people have really grown to love it in nigeria for example they call this stringy texture the draw it's stringy as you draw it out draw soup okra is a name of arabic origin though in the bantu languages that would have been spoken by enslaved people in louisiana it sounds an awful lot like gumbo ki ngumbo is one example so maybe that's where the word gumbo comes from to this day you'll encounter usually older folks here in the south who refer to okra pods as gumbo and okra has a really nice kind of meaty taste i really like the taste do you need the thickening component of it obviously not with all that roux in there and if you use the filet at the table nah lots of contemporary gumbo recipes call for boiling the sliced okra in vinegar water to de-slime it first make your gumbo however you want it that's all anybody in louisiana has been doing for centuries there's a million different versions honestly gumbo the stew is not my favorite thing i do like it as sort of a tactile reminder about how everything and everybody comes from somewhere,3

***ROASTED GRAPE...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.183328, the tremendously convenient sheet pan dinner concept is easily applied to pasta sauces very quick and convenient way to make delicious vegetable heavy pastas i'm gonna show you two recipes more like 2.5 and you can easily do them in the time it takes to boil the pasta oops there was a camera in that box of orichetti half a box half a pound 225 grams in salted water that's two portions get yourself one of them boxes of tiny tomatoes in u.s grocery stores these are the fresh tomatoes most likely to actually taste like something in any season they're pretty solid and you can wash them right in there it's a one pint box which is a volume measure maybe 12 ounces or 340 grams of grape tomatoes for two portions every single one cut in half you gotta be careful cutting around things i try to kind of clamp over the tomato with my fingers and then use a sawing motion rather than a pressing motion i saw with hardly any pressure at all at first until the knife bites through the skin until the knife bites you're at risk of either crushing the tomato or rolling it under your knife and losing control on those go to the sheet pan a shallot or any little chunk of onion i find quarter moons are a good shape for pasta cut each half down the middle then make thin slices across thin quarter rounds big enough to stick to the pasta small enough so they don't have the texture of slimy worms a few garlic cloves and for this recipe it actually helps to not chop them too fine big chunks are less likely to burn under the broiler slash grill and i've got a stick of rosemary here i'm going to chop this up and put it in the oven with everything else we'll get more flavor out of it by cooking it real good that will lose the bright green color no worries i've got some basil for that and you can slice a fresh red chili and put it on there too but i'll call this done pepper and salt on everything plenty of olive oil get in there with your hands get everything coated and spread out into a single even layer turn the broiler slash grill on high and slide the pan right under it if the element is red hot this should take at the very most five

when you scan your first receipt a limited time offer thank you fetch so yeah as soon as my tomato skins are browning that's enough for me take it much further than that and the tomatoes will just fall apart which you know you might like drain those or ketty and i'm going to throw just half of them back in the pan i want to show you two ways to do this the first one being to just throw in your broiled stuff maybe a little raw oil just for the fruity taste you lose in the oven some fresh basil because it tastes good and will be bright green unlike the rosemary in there and then stir i want to stir it hard enough that some of the tomatoes break up and you get a little saucy consistency but if i stir too hard all the tomato guts will fall out of their skins and i just have tomato sauce with a bunch of skins swimming around it i'm not into that i still want intact roasted tomato halves in there to bite through a little cheese on top and sometimes i like a little fresh oil on the cheese super tasty super summery pasta couldn't be easier but what if you want something more like a tomato sauce well pasta in the pan sieve on top dump in all the roasted stuff grab a wooden spoon and grind push down as you swirl around if you have a food mill you could use that instead this is basically an improvised food mill and eventually there's nothing but skins in the sieve underneath is an incredibly fresh tasting tomato sauce it's got bright rawness but also some of those dark roasted flavors maybe it doesn't look too pretty since it's so refined but you can mix back in a few of your chunkies just to give it some texture maybe a little fresh oil tear in the fresh basil and toss to coat everything and there you go if all the skins were swimming around loose in there they'd be kind of gross that is silky smooth and would work fine without cheese but imma do cheese because i can it's amazing how different that tastes compared to a more conventional tomato sauce but now let's try something super unconventional it's a recipe i improvised the other day get another half a box of pasta boiling fennel one of my favorite vegetables cut off the stalks and save those for later take the bulb stand it up and carefully cut it in half take the halves and shave them slice as thinly as conveniently possible with the knife this stuff has the texture of celery but a mild licorice flavor and when those strips are just barely cooked they kind of feel like noodles in your mouth on the sheet pan radicchio also known as italian chicory texture-wise radicchio is kind of halfway between lettuce and cabbage i'll pull off any wilted outer leaves there and just barely shave off the root end because i want the core intact i'm gonna cut this into wedges and i need the core to hold the leaves together the flavor of radicchio is bitter pleasantly bitter though it mellows out a bit when you cook it the italians often grill it which i suppose we're going to do if you're among those people who call a broiler a grill beans cannellini beans drained rinsed and tapped a little dry onto the pan with those time to season everything with pepper and salt not too much salt on the beans they're already salty a whole bunch of chili flakes to make this spicy and then i'm doing caraway seeds i love these my wife doesn't nor does she like the licorice flavor or bitter greens can you tell she's out of town today olive oil everywhere tossed to coat everything and get it flattened into a single layer and under the red hot top element once again while we wait for all that to brown i'll harvest the green fronds from those fennel tops i found out the hard way that when you use these to garnish food they can kind of look like green body hair it helps to chop them up a little bit first after a couple of minutes the beans should start to explode literally explode love it it helps them break down into a sauce and they brown very deliciously four or five minutes total that tray is done drain the pasta throw it back in the pot and then i'll scoop in a bunch of my roasted beans just the beans because what i want to do now is stir this really aggressively i want to mash up the beans just enough so they'll form a paste and bind everything together a bit in goes all my other good stuff and that pot does not offer enough space in which to toss everything together hey you know it would work better the pan it's already dirty and it's already warm so it won't suck the heat out of this a drizzle of fresh oil and i'll scatter on my chopped fennel fronds now i've got plenty of space to toss this around easily four portions of food there even though there's only half a box of pasta a really great vegetable heavy plate this is certainly it's great with some pecorino on top if you want quick roasted radicchio still crisp but nicely browned this mixture of pasta and beans is very reminiscent of sicily or of north africa which is no doubt where the sicilians got the idea and what would taste even more north african would be the vegan version of this squeeze on a bunch of lemon instead of grating on cheese toss and this is very tasty warm but you could probably chill this and call it a pasta salad if you wanted the moral of the story is take little bits of whatever you have throw them on a sheet pan under the grill for a few minutes and toss everything with pasta it's pretty tough to go wrong,3

2017 review...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.183328," Alligator meat: not my favorite thing in the
world, but you might like it. It's super nutritious, really low in saturated fat, and it's probably
the case that alligator farming has played a big role in saving these important critters
from extinction. They were hunted to the brink by the mid-20th century, more for their skins
than for the meat. The meat was mostly a byproduct of the leather industry. Might as well not
let it go to waste, right? I'm going to tell you how this meat is produced, how you cook
it, and what it tastes like. I'm leaning heavily here on this recent scholarly review of alligator
aquaculture research, linked in the description. But first, what even are alligators, and why
aren't they crocodiles? Well, in a sense, they are. Alligators are of the order crocodilia,
which originated about a hundred million years ago. They aren't dinosaurs, but they shared
some time with the dinosaurs and were closely related to them — still are, in fact, because
crocodilia are the living animals most closely related to birds, and birds are dinosaurs.
Did you get that memo by the way? Because I somehow missed it. I mean, back in school,
they taught us that birds are descended from dinosaurs, but in an intervening years, a
clear scientific consensus has emerged that birds literally are dinosaurs, the last living
dinosaurs. They're theropods, just like the T-Rex. Do you realize what this means? This
means dino nuggets are the most scientifically accurate shape of nugget. It also means that
birds are clearly, unambiguously reptiles, even though historically they weren't considered
as such. And that helps explain why alligator meat tastes so much like chicken. Gators and
chickens are cousins. But anyway, crocodiles, the collection of species known as true crocodiles
are indigenous to tropical waters all over the planet. They're big, aggressive. Alligators,
on the other hand, are indigenous to only two places. There's a species in eastern China and there's
a species in southeastern North America, where I am. I saw these guys in Florida. Alligators
are generally a little smaller than true crocodiles and not quite as aggressive, gators do swamps
and marshes, not open water, and they prefer freshwater. Alligators also range pretty far
beyond the tropics. A crocodile gets cold, it straight up dies. Alligators can thrive
surprisingly far north here in the United States, and that's in part due to behavioral
adaptations. They're nocturnal in the summer and diurnal in the winter, and in the dead
of winter, they brumate, which is the reptile equivalent of hibernation. They stick their
snout above water, let it freeze around their nose, and they breathe through the hole as
they just chill. Alligators will occasionally kill people, but they also keep other destructive
pests in check. Plus, they burrow holes in the marshes that become crucial habitat for
lots of other animals. So, it mattered when the leather industry
drove gator populations critically low across much of their native range by the 1950s and
'60s. Gators are a big part of the cultural identity of Louisiana, where the meat has
been used in Cajun and Creole cuisine for centuries. And it was Louisiana that first
made efforts to protect alligators. They banned hunting outright in 1962. Five years later,
the U.S. Federal Government did the same. This must've been a kind of hard thing to
do politically. Unless the animal is furry and cute, people usually aren't that interested
in protecting big, scary apex predators like snakes, or crocs, or sharks. But this shark

the State of Louisiana banned gator hunting in the 1960s. They also funded a lot of research
into gator reproduction and habitat management, and with that data, they were able to launch
a ""sustainable use"" program that has been a tremendous success. The wild population rebounded so fast that
they were off the endangered species list by 1987. Limited hunting is allowed again
and farming is allowed. Alligators are farmed across the coastal southeast, but the epicenter
of the industry is Louisiana. There's about 2 million wild gators in the state today and
about half a million on farms. Well, technically, they're ranches. It's pretty easy to keep
alligators in captivity. It's really hard to breed them in captivity. They simply need
lots of open space for their mating and courtship rituals. So, a lot of alligator farmers in
the United States source their eggs from the wild. That's a tricky job, not only because
there is likely to be an angry mama alligator nearby, but also, you have to keep the eggs
upright. If you turn alligator eggs upside down, the embryo dies. So, what they do is
they mark the top and they very carefully transfer the eggs back to the farm to an incubator.
There, the baby alligators have a much better chance of survival than they do in the wild. Once they've grown to a meter, a meter and
a half, the farmers return 12% of them to the wild. That figure reflects the number
of animals that likely would have successfully hatched and survived had the eggs remained
in the nest. So, farming alligators helps wild alligators by relieving hunting pressure
on them, and swiping those wild eggs does not hurt the wild alligators, just the opposite,
in fact. The market for wild eggs creates an economic incentive for landowners to preserve
alligator habitats. They make money by allowing egg collectors on their land, so it's in their
interest to preserve vital wetlands. Alligator farming can be a tricky business though. Remember
that the meat is historically a byproduct. The real money has been in the skins, most
of which are still exported to France and Italy. Capricious fashion trends create huge year-to-year
swings in the market demand for gator leather. Some farmers are able to supplement their
income by making their farms into tourist attractions. I shot all this footage at a
tourist trap — pay some money and feed the gators. The meat also offers a more stable
market to farmers. There's even research on how discarded alligator fat could be sold
for biofuels. All that said, people do have some particular ethical concerns about gator
farming. For one thing, these animals are not domesticated. Humans have bred cows over
millennia to thrive on our ranches. Gators are still genetically wild and there's research
indicating particular levels of physiological stress among gators in captivity. Though the
ones hatched in captivity do seem to do a lot better — those males are less aggressive
toward each other, for example. Certainly humane and sanitary conditions could vary
from farm to farm, but farmers do have an economic incentive to keep the tanks clean
and not too crowded. If things get gross in there, disease spreads and they lose money.
Animal rights groups have also raised concern about slaughter, which in the U.S. generally
involves using the same kind of captive bolt gun that they use to knock cows. This destroys
or shuts down the animal's brain before it is bled out. The concern is that maybe alligators
are just harder to kill, more likely to still be conscious when they're cut. That seems
like it could be true to me. I can imagine that might be true, but I've not been able
to find any kind of scientific research documenting that this is a particular problem with alligator
harvest. There's one study that finds captive bolt and similar methods to be pretty effective
at extinguishing consciousness if it's done properly. I worry that could be a big ""if."" There's an ongoing legal fight between Louisiana
and California over gator products. California wants to ban imports of any dead gator parts.
One of the stronger arguments in favor of that ban is that American gator products look
really similar to products made from species that are still critically endangered. As this
argument goes, the only way that you can stamp out trade in endangered crocodilia is by stamping
out trade in all crocodilia. And that makes sense to me. It's certainly true that there
is a social stigma here in the U.S. against wearing exotic animal skins, and the market
for gator leather has been in decline here. This brings us back to the meat. People generally
consider the choicest meats to be from the tail. These are tail pieces, often called
loins. There's two sides of it, the bones would have been in the middle between them
there. This meat looks and feels and tastes a lot like poultry white meat. Yes, that's because they're closely related
animals, but also because this muscle tissue does a job similar to the one performed by
chicken breast. These muscles are for sudden, explosive effort. Chickens don't fly long
distances continuously, right? They just kind of hover for a second. So, there's not much
red myoglobin in this tissue for storing oxygen for long-term sustained effort, and it's filled
with fast-twitch muscle fibers that are for short, strong bursts. Same deal with the gator
tail. They don't use it continuously. They mostly laze around all day. They just need
short bursts of propulsion when they pounce. Some of their muscles they use more frequently,
like the meat around their legs — that's the dark meat, which you can also buy but
it's less popular. Also less popular is the meat from the body,
which has this kind of flaked texture to it, with these ribbons of fat running through
it. You can see a bit of that in the structure of this tail meat. In the body, it's more
pronounced and the meat can have this weird, spongy texture if you don't grind it into
sausage or burgers or something. Like all large and long-lived aquatic predators, alligators
can also accumulate mercury in their muscle from the contaminated smaller fish that they
eat. It's the same thing that happens with tuna and swordfish, though there's no mercury
advisory against the gator meat as yet. It's probably a much bigger deal with wild gator.
Wild gator meat can also taste a little bit fishy. People say that it tastes like fish,
feels like chicken. This farmed gator that I got had no fishy taste whatsoever. It was also pretty tender, because farmed
alligators are usually harvested young — maybe a year and a half. In the wild, gators can
live as long as a person, getting bigger and tougher every year. This, you could easily
have told me it was chicken breast and I'd have been fooled — or maybe turkey. Since
it's a larger animal, the meat grain is a little more coarse, like the breast from a
turkey. There's very little research on foodborne illness and gator meat. There have been some
documented outbreaks of salmonella among the gators on gator farms. I don't know, I would
probably cook it the same temperature you do with chicken — not just for safety, but
also for taste. Because this tail muscle is the same kind of tissue as in chicken breast,
it has that same slimy texture that chicken breast has when it's really undercooked. Like
I said, it's not my favorite thing, and I do have ethical concerns about it. But certainly,

***ASPARAGUS...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.183328, shrimp is uniquely well suited to sheet pan dinners that is a meal where you throw all the components on one baking sheet toss it in the oven and you're done it's the universe's gift to weeknights i'll show you two sheet pan dinners with shrimp first thing is to get a pound of shrimp thawing unless i get them from a guy with a boat i'm pretty sure i get the freshest product frozen just cover them in cool water and leave the water trickling they'll be thawed in 10 minutes and smaller shrimp would thaw even faster meanwhile we can prep vegetables asparagus cooks in the exact same time as large shrimp i usually take off the upper rubber band and leave the lower one go rinse those and then feel with the knife for the spot where the stems go woody it's literally lignin the stuff that turns plant stems into wood the lignin creeps up higher the older the asparagus gets and unfortunately this is pretty old so i had to take off a lot but it was all contained by that rubber band on the sheet pan with those spears i'll peel and chop a bunch of garlic for those i like a lot of garlic on asparagus i'm going to roast some big chunks of shallot you could use any kind of onion but the shrimp is our benchmark i gotta cut things into chunks that will cook in the same time as those pretty good size shrimp we've got when i cut the root ends i'm taking off only a tiny sliver because i want the base to hold those layers together on the sheet pan some corn on the cob it's in season one for me one for lauren this will be a generous protein heavy meal for two if it's fresh i like my sweet corn just barely warmed up so not on the sheet pan yet throw all that onto the compost i'll prep my fresh herb this is lemon balm which is exactly what it sounds like but parsley would be great instead i'm going big on the lemon theme today lemon zest plus garlic on asparagus is outrageous highly recommended save that lemon for squeezing when we eat shrimp is thawed i usually buy it shell on vein intact it's a lot cheaper that way somebody told me about this fork trick where you push the tines of the fork up the back and then theoretically that pulls everything off in one go not really working for me i'll go with my normal method which is to use kitchen scissors just snip along the back and this allows you to snip through the tail it's really easy now to peel off the whole shell including that bit on the tail i usually dump my shells right into that same bowl and the scissors have also left a shallow incision through which we can access the quote-unquote vein the shrimp's intestinal tract you can just pull it out that gets to be a big deal with shrimp this size you'd feel the sand in your mouth with little shrimp it doesn't really matter honestly for a weeknight meal you might prefer to buy pre-peeled shrimp no shame in that they're just a little pricier and maybe not as fresh when i'm done i'll drain those shells either freeze them for stock right away or get them out of your kitchen they'll start to smell rapidly then i can give these one more rinse they'll brown better if they're dry so a little paper towel on the pan shrimp on top dab them until dry time to season everything pepper on everything salt on everything they'll go easy on the shrimp shrimp tend to be soaked in brine as part of their processing you could do old bay or some other classic seafood seasoning on the shrimp i'm doing some garlic powder onion powder and smoked paprika drizzle everything with just a little olive oil a little goes a long way and then smoosh it all around get every piece of food coated in oil and seasoning with the asparagus you'll note the garlic pieces tend to slip down to the bottom that's good they'll be protected from burning down there i'm tossing the shrimp last so that i don't pollute the other stuff with shrimpiness though i suppose it doesn't matter what does matter is getting everything spread out to an even layer no two pieces should be overlapping now we can flip on the broiler slash grill it heats up so fast that you can do that right before you want to cook oh like my

guess shrimp this big would take maybe six minutes under there total while we wait we can cut our lemon into wedges for juicing i'll just check the pan once halfway through you could flip all the shrimp if you want they cook more evenly this way but sometimes i just leave them inside one gets super brown and crunchy while side two stays really moist either way is good with the asparagus you can just kind of nudge them to roll them around a little bit asparagus gets very meaty when it browns under the broiler and those shallots we can safely roll around because we didn't slice off the bit at the base that holds the layers together now is when i'll throw on my sweet corn whoops that is overexposed try that again if you like your corn more cooked you could have had them in this whole time like i said with fresh corn i really just want to warm it up a bit and three or four minutes under the broiler should do that just fine now i can melt a little butter on those and sprinkle with salt the lemon balm i'll scatter on my shrimp toss them around to wilt it a bit then everybody can dig in squeeze some lemon on grab a shrimp man i love a big chunk of roasted onion and i love how the pan keeps everything warm yeah we just told you you don't even need plates you just put the tray between you and you go to town that said you could feed more than two people from a single tray for this next one let's do a larger meal shrimp and tzatziki is an underrated combination to make it i'll need some grated garlic which means i need to peel it without crushing it rolling loosens the skin enough that you can peel it off you could chop it fine instead of grating one large clove like this will be very strong in tsadziki because it's going to be raw zest up a lemon you could skip that if you want to do vinegar instead of lemon juice i quite like fresh mint in tzatziki plus some fresh dill though you could get by with just one or the other chop them up fine and then all that goes into a bowl cucumber the ones sold wrapped in plastic here in the states are marketed as english cucumbers i really like them you don't need to peel them or seed them i'm only unwrapping half for now save the rest for later grate this half up nice and fine and traditionally you'd squeeze that in cheese cloth or in a sieve or something to get out the excess water smashing with a paper towel works fine too cut the lemon and then maybe squeeze in just one half for now you can always add later then plain yogurt i would guess about a cup for this much stuff stir that up and have a taste need salt pepper and a little olive oil in there is nice and i'm going for the rest of the lemon which will be very acidic but i'm not using this as a dip or as a side dish as you would traditionally in grease or turkey i'm using it as a sauce so i needed to be stronger and i needed to be thinner i want a drizzling consistency so it was dumb for me to bother squeezing out the cucumber juice i gotta stir in a bunch of milk now to loosen this up you can of course buy tzatziki if you make it yourself it's all the better to make it the day before it improves in the fridge now get my shrimp thawing as before a pound or half a kilo like this is enough for four people as long as you have plenty of other stuff this time i'll season them with cracked whole seeds i've got mustard seeds celery seeds i'll put in some chili flakes i want them big and chunky but if i smash them just a little in the mortar and pestle that'll release some flavor and it'll help them stick to the shrimp check out the girth of these leeks big leeks are good for roasting and whole rounds because you're going to have to sacrifice the outer layer or two there's simply too much dirt hiding underneath them once you have those peeled off give them a rinse and cut off the tops there's probably dirt hiding in there too have a look that one looks clean same thing on this one and nope look dirt we gotta cut a little further down to get past the dirt these you can pull apart wash off and throw in stock i like roasted leeks to be really crunchy and again i have pretty big shrimp so i need to cut these rounds really thick if i don't want them to go too soft if you like them softer cut thinner rounds i like them really crisp onto the tray since i have one i'll slice up a red chili to roast with the leeks it looks pretty and i'm going for a spicy vibe with this tray the leftover cucumber since i have it i might as well slice it thin and then we can have some fresh raw cucumber slices on the side which is always a nice thing to have with a spicy meal and for herb i've got this fancy purple basil plant beautiful but any herb could work more of the dill left over from the tzatziki peel the shrimp as before and dump it on the tray then i'll grab a can of chickpeas and drain it in a sieve and rinse man i love chickpeas but real talk they smell like dog food straight out of the can on the tray they go and i will blot dry both the shrimp and the chickpeas i want to roast the chickpeas brown and crunchy so dry helps my cracked seeds go on the shrimp let's do some harissa powder on the chickpeas any spicy seasoning would be great on them just throw some pepper on the leeks salt on everything but again go easy on the shrimp because they're already salty the chickpeas might be a little salty too depending on the can drizzle olive oil everywhere get in and toss everything to get it all coated and remember everything's got to be laid flat and evenly spaced i'll put those chili slices on top the leeks so they get charred charred chili is awesome under the red hot grill we go after about three minutes i'll flip some stuff around shrimp unfortunately is a food that you just have to cook yourself a few times to get a feel for doneness they're too small to get an accurate temperature reading on you just got to cook them and find out how done you like them and learn what that looks like i like them starting to get a little crunchy which they are after six or seven minutes and the chickpeas are exploding be careful they're basically like popcorn if you broil them dry super crunchy and delicious those are going to be make some room and throw on my cool cucumber slices scatter those basil leaves over everything then time to drizzle on my tzatziki sauce a nice cool combination with spicy shrimp what a feast this is easily enough for four people super healthy cheap and done in a flash if the leak rounds are too big to eat don't try cutting them up just try sliding off a few rings at a time nice i hope i've given you a few ideas that you could try the beauty of shrimp is it cooks in about the exact same time as vegetables so throw some on a pan with veggies and call it a night,3

Thanks to Dr. Bill Tracy...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.183328," I don't think any food has changed more in
my lifetime than this one right here. When I was a kid, most of the sweet corn that you
encountered wasn't actually sweet, and sweet corn that isn't sweet is one of the most disappointing
foods in the world. You'd get this sad little half an ear on your school lunch tray, and
it would taste like, well, nothing, basically nothing. These days, even bad sweet corn is
usually pretty good, or at least it's pretty sweet. The texture might actually be not as
good as it used to be, and those two developments are directly related. We'll get to that, but
let's start at the beginning. What even is sweet corn? Like all cereal grains, corn is grass seed
— giant seeds from giant grass plants, first domesticated in what is now southern Mexico
about 10,000 years ago. Botanically, corn is way closer to wheat, and oats, and rice,
and such than it is to carrots or broccoli, so why do we consider corn a vegetable? Well,
we don't, right? We consider sweet corn a vegetable, but sweet corn is like a tiny fraction
of all of the corn that's grown in the world. Here in the U.S., It's 1% of the total corn
crop. The rest of the crop is this: field corn.
Most corn is field corn, and this corn we consider a grain, a starch. This corn is tortillas,
and grits, and polenta, and cornbread, and Corn Flakes, and popcorn, and a million non-food
products like ethanol fuels, and a million semi-food products like high-fructose corn
syrup. All those things are corn, and none of them are vegetables, yet, sweet corn is.
Why? Well, in part it's genetics, but arguably
the bigger difference is simply when you harvest it. Sweet corn you pick when the plant is
still green, long before the seeds are mature and dried, and ready to drop and grow into
new corn plants. It's like if you were to harvest wheat when it's still green, and eat
the seeds when they're soft and wet on the inside — which you can do, by the way. Corn
probably works better as a vegetable than other grains, because the grains of corn are
just so huge. You get lots of juicy inside, relative to the fibrous outside. That is sweet
corn. Field corn is called field corn because you
let the plants grow, live, die, and shrivel up right there in the field, so that the seeds
will dry out. This is also how we do most other grains like this rye here. It lives,
then it dies, and there's your ""amber waves of grain."" These are also amber waves of grain,
though I always think that field corn blowing around looks less like the ocean, and more
like a mosh pit. See, doesn't it look like they're moshing? Do the kids today still mosh? Now, dried grain is great stuff. It's preserved,
so you can store it and eat it all year long. You don't have to spend every single day of
your life hunting and gathering. You have time to do other things like invent civilization.
But there comes a brief window in every grain farmer's season when they can pull some of
the seeds off and eat them fresh — raw, even. That's way easier than eating dried
grains. For all of their advantages, dried grains are hard. You have to grind them up
into flour, and then mix them with water, and then boil them or bake them. These you can just put in your mouth, and
when I get good sweet corn, I don't even really cook it. I just steam it for like a minute
until it's warm enough to melt butter. Ancient American farmers ate at least a bit of their
corn fresh or green, like this. Many different tribes developed green corn festivals to celebrate
the summer harvest, and they gradually developed corn varieties that taste better when eaten
green. Specifically, they bred corn with a tweaked gene that scientists now call su1,
sugary-1. Golden Bantam — one of the most common heirloom sweet corn varieties still
grown today — that's an su1 variety. ""Native peoples isolated different sugary-1
mutants that all do the same thing, but different mutants at least five times in the Western
hemisphere."" That's Dr. Bill Tracy at the University of
Wisconsin. He's one of the most prominent sweet corn breeders in the world. Check out
his chair in the background. A-maize-ing. I'll see myself out now, but now is a good
time to clarify that Dr. Tracy uses the term ""maize"" rather than ""corn"" when he is referring
to sweet corn genetics. Maize is a word of indigenous origin. ""Corn"" is a very old Germanic
word for any and all grains, or actually any object that's little and hard. In America,
English-speaking colonists first called this ""Indian corn,"" which gradually just got shortened
to ""corn."" Anyway, that sugary-1 gene that farmers first started isolating maybe 6,000
years ago, what's it do? ""I have to say something here that might confuse
you and your viewers. The genes that I'm talking about knock out function. So I will actually
be talking about the sugary gene as doing something, but what it's doing is preventing
the normal action. So the dominant sugary gene, the kind that all the field corn has,
actually makes starch."" Right. So normal field corn photosynthesizes
carbon dioxide and water into sugar, which the plant then converts into huge chains of
sugar called starch. Raw starches feel a little gritty in the mouth and do not taste sweet
to us, but they are much more useful to the plant. The seed eats the starch to fuel its
growth up into a new corn plant. This sugary-1 gene mutation hinders the plant's normal starch
conversion process. ""You knock that gene out, and instead — with
like the gene that's Golden Bantam has, this 'little su,' if you will — that increases
the sugar level and increases this compound called phytoglycogen, at the expense of starch."" And phytoglycogen is this kind of rare and
special substance that makes sweet corn creamy. It's a carb that retains a lot of water, and
it feels nice and smooth in the mouth. Field corn has mostly starch, sweet corn has starch
and sugar, and phytoglycogen, and some proteins and fats and such that all corn has. But don't
kid yourself — even if we call it a vegetable, we're talking about a carb here. You're mostly
eating water, and fiber, and carbs. If you're like me, and you could use more
protein and fewer carbs in your diet, consider the sponsor of this video, Magic Spoon Cereal.
The predominant ingredient in American breakfast cereals is field corn, because corn is so
cheap and abundant here, but too much of it will fatten you up like a head of prime beef
cattle. I don't want to be well-marbled. So Magic Spoon has no corn, no grain of any kind.
It's mostly made out of milk protein, and it uses alternative sweeteners. The flavorings

that fails to convert all of its sugar into starch — at least, not at first. Problem
is, you have a very narrow window in which to harvest sweet corn when it's still sweet,
and then once you do harvest it, take it off the plant, you got to move real quick, because
enzymes in there start to convert the sugar into starch crazy fast. How fast? ""The old story was that if you were going
to pick sweet corn, the old fashioned type of sweet corn, the way to make sure it was
optimal is to get the water boiling on the stove before you go out, go out to the patch,
pick the corn, and then run back to the house, and if you drop one ear, don't stop to pick
it up, because it'll all lose its quality. That's of course an exaggeration, but that's
the legend, and a lot of it's true. Sweet corn, as I said, the old fashioned sugary
type of corn, when picked at a prime stage,10 to 15% sugar, in 24 hours at room temperature,
it will lose at least half its sugar. So the next day, it really won't be very good."" And that, kids, is the world that Old Man
Ragusea was born into. Most sweet corn that you'd find was simply too old to be sweet
anymore. All of the sugar had converted into starch. There were three ways that you could
get sweet corn that was still sweet. Option one was get it frozen. Corn was one of the
first foods to be frozen successfully by Clarence Birdseye about a hundred years ago. Freezing
halts those enzymatic processes. Problem is, he had to cut the kernels off the cob to increase
their surface area, and freeze them really fast. If you freeze stuff too slow, it goes
mushy. I have a whole video about flash freezing in the description. Option two was grow your own sweet corn, which
we did when I was growing up in rural Pennsylvania. We grew Golden Bantam, and I had corn on the
cob every night for dinner all the way through August, and I did not appreciate it as much
as I should have. Option three was go to a farm stand like this
one, buy some corn straight from the hand that picked it that same day, and go home
and cook it that night. But hold on, what variety are they growing here? What's that
called, peaches and cream? That is not an heirloom. That's one of these newfangled corn
varieties that is likely to be sweet, even if it isn't super fresh. The new sweet corn
has its origins in the 1950s at the University of Illinois, where there was a botany professor
named John Laughnan. It's a super blurry photo, but that's him in the '50s, when all this
started. Laughnan was not trying to revolutionize sweet corn. ""He was doing a study on what's known as genetic
linkage. He was a basic scientist, and he was trying to understand how genes were linked
on a chromosome, or why they were linked."" Another geneticist in Michigan sent Laughnan
some corn to study that had this weird sh2 gene, shrunken-2 gene. It was this gene that
made the kernels kind of small, and they would shrivel up, which you would consider to be
a bug and not a feature, but then Laughnan tasted it. ""And he got a hit of sugar. So he thought,
Ah, something's going on here. And he actually then did the basic biochemistry and found
indeed, instead of the 10 to 15% sugar that the sugary-1 crop corn had, some of these
had 35 to 40% sugar, but they had no phytoglycogen. They don't make the phytoglycogen. They make
lots of sugar."" Laughnan went on to hybridize the first commercial
supersweet variety, Illini Xtra Sweet. It's still in the seed catalogs today. It starts
off extremely sweet, so it can stand to lose some sugar post-harvest, and it loses that
sugar at a slower rate. The problem was the texture — super crunchy, but not creamy.
Also, these new supersweet hybrids tended to have trouble germinating in the field.
The seed's main food source is the starch, not sugar. That's why the plant is supposed
to make starch. Humans come along and we screw all that up. Also because the supersweets
shrivel, they tend to crack when they dry, and then water gets in and they rot in the
field, and they just have trouble germinating. As a result, supersweets didn't even start
to get popular with farmers until about the '80s, as supersweet breeders, like Dr. Tracy,
were able to fix a lot of these problems. I can't remember the last time I saw old fashioned
sweet corn at a regular grocery store. Something like Golden Bantam or Silver Queen, they're
just not at the store anymore. There's no reason for a grocer to sell heirloom varieties,
because it's nearly impossible for them to get it to you and into your kitchen, into
your mouth, while it's still sweet. Funny thing is, some of these newer varieties might
actually be too sweet when fresh picked. You have to let them simmer down for a few days.
But what about the texture? ""We're now working on a new type of corn that
has a different gene. It's called the shrunken2-i gene, and it's the same supersweet gene, but
it does something slightly different. It improves the mouthfeel of the supersweet. You still
get a sweet flavor, but mouthfeel, the supersweets don't have that phytoglycogen, So they're
not really creamy. They're kind of watery. They're good, people like them, but these
new ones that we're developing have a crunch like a Honeycrisp apple, very different from
what we normally expect in sweet corn. And people tend to love it, and we're really excited
about this. There are some of these coming to the market now, and hopefully we'll see
some more, very soon."" It's also worth pointing out that the new
supersweet varieties actually have more protein per calorie than the old heirloom sweet corn.
So rejoice, this is all good, and there's nothing unnatural about it. People like Dr.
Tracy arrive at these varieties via crossbreeding, the same way humans have done for thousands
of years to domesticate crops. Now, a few sweet corn varieties are also GMOs, but that
is purely incidental. They're not GMO-ing them to make them sweeter, they're genetically
engineering them to make them herbicide resistant or pest resistant, like you do with all the
other GMOs. And whether or not GMOs are even a thing to be feared is something that we
should talk about another day.",3
Garlic naan grilled on oven grates,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RgfZikXWKMo/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLBEBGxty-Bk8iqrDaUpiTYLET6A1g,RgfZikXWKMo,"8 minutes, 48 seconds","Thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this video!

squarespace you can bake really good naan by just grilling it directly on your oven grates i use the same method sometimes for pizza you need no special equipment and doing it this way has a lot of advantages is it the best homemade naan well the texture is a little different than naan they bake in a tandoor in a restaurant you can more closely imitate the real thing with the tawa method i have a whole video about this in the description you wet the bottom of the dough to make it sticky you throw it into a hot ungreased indian style flat tawa or a western style cast iron skillet like this works okay too you just cook it on the stovetop until you think the bottom is done you can't actually look at the bottom so you have to make an educated guess then you invert the pan the bread sticks and hangs upside down while you cook the top over direct flame works okay on a resistance coil stove too but not on induction then if you are able to unstick that from the bottom the result is indistinguishable from non-baked in a tender but this method is tricky i burned the bottom a little bit there and most significantly you can only bake one small loaf at a time with this oven method i'ma show you right now you could bake enough bread for a whole big dinner all at the same time it's all equally hot and crisp at the same time and it tastes really good this method will work with any typical non-dough this is my basic yeast non-dough though i'm doubling it because this method is great for baking a lot of bread four cups of flour like 500 grams a couple of teaspoons of sugar one teaspoon of salt i use morton kosher and that's not much salt i'm assuming you're going to put more salt on top later a teaspoon of baking powder i get better bubbles if i use that in addition to the yeast a couple of teaspoons of dry yeast you can throw in the whole packet only about two tablespoons of yogurt you could do a little more it tastes good but i find too much acid plus the yeast interferes with the gluten and it makes the dough short or crumbly a couple of tablespoons of oil and a cup of milk or water to start with 200 ml to start with start mixing with a spoon and add just enough additional milk to make this come together no more i'm using bread flour today instead of all purpose all purpose is fine but bread flour has more protein and more protein absorbs more water so i might need a fair bit more milk you won't know the moisture level for sure until you get in with your hand and really start kneading actually i think i overshot it on the milk more flour nearly every indian recipe i've read for nan says the dough should be pretty dry just barely sticky and you don't have to knead it to death at this stage just get it reasonably smooth and elastic the yogurt will make the surface look a little rough no matter how much you need it and see just barely sticky this is good cover it with a wet towel or something and let it rise until it's twice as big at least an hour probably two while you wait you can prepare your toppings i'm just doing the standard garlic naan thing i love it peel and chop a bunch of garlic then chop a bunch of cilantro or coriander leaf as they'd call it in india and get a little melted butter handy too you could instead make a no yeast dough which is also traditional my version of that recipe is in the description it's very similar but instead of yeast you use a lot of yogurt with active bacterial cultures in it for me i found the key is to let this dough sit overnight it rises much more slowly but here we are the next day and check how puffy that is i think this makes nan with better texture but i think the yeast dough makes nan with better flavor this is the yeast dough after a couple hours i'll punch it down and divide it into maybe four chunks maybe knead them just a little bit more and shape them into balls this will make four loaves that are each twice the size of the one that i did in the pan at the beginning of the video there we go yeah you can wash your hands before you do cover those let them rest for at least 15 minutes and they'll roll out much easier right before i roll i will do myself a favor and throw a baking sheet or a big piece of foil onto the bottom rack of my oven stuff is gonna fall and this will catch it and make cleanup really easy time to turn on the top element that americans call a broiler while brits and people formerly colonized by brits call a grill i love this thing it gets red hot in seconds and will replicate the intense direct heat of a tender grab a dough ball and roll it out almost as thin as you could possibly roll it you might need some flour to keep things from sticking or you might not get your toppings and smear them on then roll them into the surface hard for this oven method in particular it's important to get them really stuck in there and hey the virtue of this method is we can do multiple loaves at once so let's prep another one i could actually fit all four of these in at once if i wanted to take those over to the oven and this part feels real weird flip the dough around and put it topping side down under the broiler which you might call a grill don't worry the baking pan is going to catch anything that falls through the grates it's really easy to just plop those in with your hands because non-dough is very sturdy and not sticky close the door to maximize the heat in there and here we are after just two minutes if you get any giant bubbles like that you might want to tamp them down before they burn not with your hand you ding-a-ling use your tongs bake a little bit more and then you can just flip these around whenever the first side is golden there's no guesswork you can see exactly what's happening these just needed 30 more seconds and the top side will need a minute at most i think a defining feature of non is the top has some brown bubbles but most of the surface is still doughy that contrast is key why do we have to do this on the grates why can't we just put the dough on a baking sheet because the baking sheet would actually shield it from much of the heat the dough would take too long to bake you wouldn't get those big steam bubbles inflating and the inside would be dry by the time the outside was brown i find this method does a better job of imitating the intense heat of a tender than even a really hot pizza stone does naan doesn't seem to bubble upright on a pizza stone i don't know why but there you go all you do now is brush it with some melted butter if your butter is unsalted you probably want to either dissolve some salt in the butter or sprinkle some salt on top flavor-wise that tastes just like restaurant naan the top and the internal structure of it just like restaurant naan the bottom is the only thing that's different it's smoother and a little less crispy than it would be from a tandoor or a tawa it's not bad it's just a little different now what if you don't feel comfortable reaching into that hot oven to deposit the dough on the grates we'll just do this roll out your loaf as before top it flip it upside down on the counter and then gently roll it up around your rolling pin take it over the oven let your rolling pin reach inside there and you just gently roll it out topping side down that method is particularly useful if you want to bake one giant loaf and what could be easier one giant loaf cut it up and everybody gets their bread in one go if you bake a lot of loaves in succession though you might start to get them sticking on the grates like that that's from the grates getting dirty and or from the grates getting really hot under the broiler which you might call a grill if this happens to you the solution is to treat your oven grates like the grates on your grill what americans call a grill while brits and people formerly colonized by brits call a barbecue this is my outdoor grill scraper that i'm using to clean this up and all the junk falls onto that pan below if you still have any trouble with sticking you can do another outdoor grill barbecue trick and grease the grates with an oily paper towel no need to clean them after such a tiny film of oil is just going to burn off you do that and sticking is impossible but i only had problems with sticking after i've been baking nan on my grates for hours which you probably would never do because the whole virtue of this method is that you can bake all your non at once just as you can get everything done at once at squarespace everything you need to buy or make in order to create

When should you salt pasta water?

Here's a great article by a Stanford professor...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.183328, it does not matter when you salt your water for dried pasta there's a pervasive belief that you have to salt the water at the beginning before you bring it to a boil there's also a pervasive belief that you have to salt it after the water is already boiling i'm gonna prove it to you those are both myths as long as you don't put in way too much salt how much is too much well that's a trickier question and we'll get back to that but put your salt in whenever as long as the salt goes in before your pasta goes in you're golden the dissolved salt will season the noodle from the inside as it cooks and swells up with the water now both these salt early and salt late myths are predicated on real facts the salt early camp points out that if you wait until right before the pasta goes in the water might not be as hot as it could be when you dump the noodles in the newly introduced salt will temporarily lower the temperature in the pot because the salt is cooler i mean unless you keep your salt in the oven or something the salt's going to be at room temperature it's cooler than the hot water plus when the salt dissolves in the water that is an endothermic reaction it takes heat energy to break apart the sodium and chloride ions the net temperature in the pot goes down and it takes the stove a little time to bring it back up again the salt early folks say you want to throw your salt in at the very beginning give everything plenty of time to come up to the highest possible temperature before you drop the pasta and indeed hotter water does cook pasta faster and better to my taste at least here's a batch i cooked the whole way at sub boiling temperatures about 95 degrees celsius this pasta shape is usually done in 10 minutes at a full boil 100 c but in the sub boiling water it took 15 minutes not 10 and the surface of the noodles was a little gummy and slimy by the time the inside was al dente so yeah i think it's probably true that you want your water boiling well when you drop your pasta in but is the salt really going to cool it down that much a few big pinches into this little boiling pot did not register at all on my consumer grade thermometer here if i start dumping in the whole salt cellar i lose a few tenths of a degree but that's way more salt than you'd ever use plus the temperature bounces right back again after a few seconds for me to get any noticeable degradation in quality of the finished cooked pasta i had to turn my heat all the way down and i had to hold my pasta at five whole degrees under the boiling point for the entire duration of cooking that resulted in a slight difference in texture over here we're talking about a dip of a tiny fraction of a degree that only lasts a few seconds there's no way that's going to have a noticeable effect on the food one other argument the salt early camp makes is that salt water comes to a boil faster than fresh water salting at the beginning will save you time this is technically true salt lowers the heat capacity of water meaning it takes less energy to raise the temperature of the water but again this only makes a noticeable difference at completely insane levels of salinity that you'd never cook with a big pinch into just a little cup of water here made no difference that i could observe with a stopwatch so that's why i'm saying the salt early rule is a myth then there's the salt late rule some people warn that if you throw your salt in right at the beginning in still cool water it won't dissolve as well and that's true at least at first as heat rises water becomes a better solvent and the physical agitation of all those bubbles does a good job of stirring the salt around getting it evenly distributed and even if the salt isn't evenly dispersed you're gonna agitate it some more with the pasta so it's all gonna get mixed up no matter what back when i first started cooking on the internet there was a self-identified professional chef who used to really love coming at me in the comments and this is back when i still had a bad habit of indulging that kind of stuff and anyway this chef just insisted that salt has this really really profound effect on the boiling temperature of water for pasta and i'll never forget what he said i cited some science indicating that salt doesn't do that much in terms of boil temperature and all of that and he said i don't care what a scientist tells me i can see with my own two eyes that when i put the salt in the water boils harder i put the salt in and the water goes whoosh from this chef deduced that the salt is making the water a lot hotter and hotter is better and i kind of felt the guy's frustration because here's the problem your eyes are really good at telling you whether something is happening they're not as good at telling you why it's happening this furious whoosh that happens when you throw in the salt this is not evidence of dissolved salt making the water boil hotter how do i know well instead of a handful of salt let's do the same exact thing with a handful of sand same deal and note that the sand is not dissolving like the salt does we still get that appearance of the water boiling harder i'm pretty sure this is because both the salt and the sand are facilitating what the scientists call bubble nucleation you ever noticed that when you first put a pot of water on the heat where the bubbles start forming is around the edge for a hot water molecule to convert into steam and form a bubble it has to overcome the atmospheric pressure pushing down on the water's surface and it has to overcome the intermolecular bonds that hold water molecules together in groups like raindrops that's called surface tension it takes much less energy for this molecule to overcome these forces and expand into a gas if there's something on the inside of the pot for bubbles to grow on what they call nucleation sites some impurity in the water or some irregularity in the pot surface look at how craggy that steel is under the microscope and as i turn the heat on check out the bubbles forming on those crevices there's some scientific articles about this in the description one explanation i've read says that those little caves form protective barriers they shield the baby bubbles from the compressive forces all around them the crevices may also harbor air pockets that were trapped when we poured in the water regardless it takes way less energy to grow a bubble than it takes to get it going so they get bigger and bigger rise to the surface because they're less dense than the water and pop in a super smooth container like glass there aren't many crevices and cracks that can serve as nucleation sites so the bubbles have trouble forming and this can result in a phenomenon known as superheating this is something that happens to me all the time when i'm boiling water in here for coffee nice pure water nice smooth glass nice even heating from the microwave no physical disturbances breaking the surface tension there's nowhere for bubbles to grow so the water actually gets hotter than its normal boiling point it super heats and eventually you might hear this sound coming from the microwave as finally the bubbles explode or they could even explode on your hand when you reach in you got to be careful or maybe you know get a kettle but definitely get your coffee from trade coffee the sponsor of this video as i have converted to a coffee drinker quite late in life

bag free thank you trade anyway that violent reaction in the microwave i'm pretty sure is just a more dramatic version of what we see happening when we throw salt into already boiling water we suddenly introduce a ton of craggy surface area into the pot providing a ton of bubble nucleation sites and whoosh teeny little pockets of superheated water in there are given a means of escape this is not an indication of the water getting hotter it's just the opposite this is heat energy leaving the pot though still not nearly enough to make a meaningful difference in how the pasta cooks now that salty chef in the comments pointed out that when salt is dissolved in water it actually raises the boiling point of the water which is true once the salt is dissolved it will take a little more energy for water in here to vaporize and escape thus the temperature inside your boiling salt water is greater than it would be in boiling fresh water and your pasta gets boiled at a slightly higher temperature yes i put my gopro in a boiling pot just for a few seconds it was fine salt water does boil hotter than fresh water but you'd have to put in a lot of salt to raise the temperature even a single degree here's a little pot of boiling fresh water hovering right around 100 c where we'd expect it now i'm going to dump in my entire salt cellar this whole thing of salt i'm going to dump this into this which is way more salt than anyone would use for pasta and it goes and as we'd expect the temperature dips at first by like half a degree a minuscule difference for pasta cooking give it a minute to rebound and that gagging amount of salt has raised the boiling point about a degree a minuscule difference for pasta cooking hey let's put in another full seller there we go and hey now we're getting somewhere 104. it's salty enough that crystals are starting to form on the rim let's do another cellar at this point we've saturated the water at normal atmospheric pressure at least we simply could not dissolve any more salt into this there's salt at the bottom that's just sitting there crystals are hopping out of solution on the side it's the dead sea in here probably about 30 percent salt in the actual dissolved liquid and the temperature 107. based on my experiments that's enough to make a slight noticeable difference in the texture of the pasta but you would never use anywhere close to this much salt how much salt would you use well there's an old adage that pasta water should be as salty as the sea i even repeated that once in one of my earliest videos here and i guess i never really thought much about it is it true sea water varies a lot but on average it's about 3.5 percent dissolved salt by weight so 965 grams of water 35 grams of salt oh i can already tell this is way more salt than i normally put in get that dissolved and bring it to a boil by the way this is really salty water and the temperature is still right around 100 c salt is irrelevant to temperature in pasta cookery boil that pasta for exactly 10 minutes per the package instructions drain and taste yeah that is way too salty i wouldn't call it inedible because it's only like half the salinity of seawater the brine is diluted by all of the dry mass of the pasta i did the math and it's about as salty as a dill pickle and i really like dill pickles but yeah that is way too salty for pasta at least to my taste maybe if you dressed it in a sauce heavily that was completely unseasoned let's see how much salt i usually use this is about how much i usually eyeball into this pot it's a couple of big pinches and wow 5 grams so if seawater is 3.5 percent salt my normal pasta water is like .5 salt boil that for 10 minutes drain and that actually tastes a little under seasoned but i suppose my sauces are usually pretty salty so dress that simply and yeah that tastes perfect to me i like the heterogeneity the sauce and the noodle complete each other and you can taste their different salinities interacting with each other as you chew through them so does this mean we shouldn't season pasta water at all that's the east asian way of doing rice right plain unseasoned steamed rice complemented by heavily seasoned accompaniments i love it everybody loves it so let's try pasta that way 10 minutes in pure fresh water drain give it a salty sauce to balance it out and ah that's not working for me it's too heterogeneous the contrast too extreme the pasta itself just tastes like gummy nothing now do i feel that way simply because i have lived my whole life eating pasta that was boiled in salty water and that's just what i'm used to i have no idea and i don't really care you like what you like right but i don't like being wrong and i was wrong when i said years ago that pasta water should be as salty as the sea however i understand why that advice has persisted for generations i think it does work in practice let me show you i tried tasting both of those salted pasta waters if you just dip your finger in really fast that little film of water cools off very rapidly in the air and you don't scald yourself you can just lick and have a taste honestly i couldn't tell much of a difference between the 3.5 seawater solution and my normal 0.5 pasta water solution maybe if i tasted them side by side but in the moment they both just tasted unpleasantly excessively salty i think the sea water adage persists simply because that's the closest analog that most of us have in our lived experience we simply don't get salt solutions anywhere near that strong in our mouths that often and we simply haven't developed a really fine perceptual instrument for telling the difference between salt solutions in this extreme high range at least i haven't i think what salty as the sea means in practice is add salt until the water tastes bad to you we are evolved to be repulsed by sea water because if we drink a lot of it we die just get the water a little saltier than taste good to you because remember the pasta will only end up being about half as salty as the water that you boiled it in from there you can adjust seasoning to taste in the pan with the sauce it's a system that's worked for generations just as coffee plus boiling water has worked don't forget to get your first bag from trade free with my link in the description and hey a tiny pinch of salt and coffee is good too,3

Sign up here https://cen.yt/mbadamragusea8 for your free daily newsletter — I’ve really enjoyed Morning Brew and I think you will too!...,2022-12-01 14:47:05.183328, here's a technique for doing great barbecue style ribs indoors in the oven it's stupid easy any kind of ribs would work but at my butcher they often have a few beef back ribs for sale it's a byproduct of boneless ribeye steaks it's great meat it's cheap and three is enough for my dinner as you can see these came cut into individual ribs even if i was buying a whole intact rack of ribs i would still cut them into individual bones before cooking them you just get more surface area that way more browning and they're easier to eat for this recipe i see no reason to peel off that membrane on the inside it'll actually help hold the meat together as they braise very soft real barbecue ribs are flavored on the inside by smoke we're not going to do that so i think it's good to do a garlicky marinade the night before just peel and chop some garlic then we'll need some vinegar and i'm going to marinate in a sealable bag but you could use a bowl first i'll salt the meat the salt is going to be dissolved in the marinade thus making it a brinenade but i put salt directly on the meat so that i can use the meat as a visual guide as to how much salt they need just remember you'll lose some to the brine so slightly over season throw these in the bag get the garlic in there a big pinch of sugar is always great in brines and marinades and then i'm using red wine vinegar but you could use any vinegar or lime juice and if you use a bag you really don't need that much because the bag will wrap around the meat and keep everything in contact i would dilute with a little water maybe one part to two parts vinegar if you marinate in straight vinegar or citrus overnight it can make the surface of the meat go mushy push the air out seal and get that all stirred up i'm getting the meaty side of the ribs facing down so that they're sure to be submerged in the fridge they go and good night next morning i'll grab a little baking tray and throw in the drained ribs i'm making some effort to scrape off the garlic its flavor is fixed in the meat all those chunks are going to do now is burn so who needs them all right i've got these positioned convex side up no idea if that actually matters it does matter for sure that you tightly crimp the foil around the top the moisture inside the meat is more than enough to braise it if you capture the steam in there i'm gonna have my ribs with a twice baked potato that's a russet a flowery potato and here's how i usually start baked potatoes coat the skin in a little oil and a lot of salt this makes the skin very tasty to eat after it's baked crispy stab it a few times like your norman baits just to let steam out and keep the skin from exploding and i'm going to flavor that potato with roasted garlic which means i'll need roasted garlic if you just need a few cloves and easy ways to cut off the root ends and leave the skin on throw them in a little scrap of foil coat in a little oil and then wrap them up tight all of that can now go in the oven the ribs the little garlic pouch and i like to bake potatoes right on the oven grates they get crispy all around close that up and i'll bake at 300 fahrenheit 150 c that's a good compromise temperature for the potato and the meat and it'll take about three hours this is a weekend meal for sure while you wait just pour yourself a brew and read yourself some morning brew the sponsor of this video having worked in news most of my career i now avoid much of it but morning brew doesn't make my head hurt like lots of other news it's fun it's a free daily newsletter on the latest in business finance and tech i've been reading it now for about a year here's the new us jobs report summed up in five sentences super quick but still with context yeah it's good news but jobs in some sectors like entertainment are still way fewer than they were pre-covered here's an indicator more weddings this year than any year since 1984. i guess there's a backlog to work through mazeltov do you and me both a favor sign up for morning brew via my link in the description it takes two seconds to sign up and it's totally free in your email every day hit my link in the description thank you morning brew now after an hour or so the garlic should be done roasting when it's golden brown and soft get that out before it burns baked potatoes are done when you pinch them and they're squishy they usually take like an hour but at this low temperature it'll probably take as long as the meat takes here we are after three hours and i just poke the meat if i can push the meat fibers apart with my finger then these are braised enough to fall off the bone though i don't actually want them to fall off yet gotta be gentle with these now the potato is squishy it's done here's all the juice and rendered fat from the ribs i'm gonna pour that off and save it i'll use some of it at this point i can just steal a little scrap of meat and taste it for seasoning these need a little more salt and now is a good time to put it on grab the potato in a little bowl cut the potato in half and just scoop out the flesh being careful to not tear the skin it helps to leave a thin reinforcing wall of white flesh behind we got plenty in the bowl and just mash that however you normally mash potatoes normally i'd enrich mashed potatoes with a lot of butter and loosen them with some milk you could do that but hey we happen to have some delicious fat and liquid right here already a spoon or two of rendered rib fats and some of that watery broth underneath just to get this to a smooth moldable consistency roasted garlic we cut the ends off the cloves so now we can just squeeze out their guts like toothpaste this stuff is divine you can spread it on bread it's sweet and not very pungent at all twice baked potato filling is usually bound with a little bit of cheese i'm grating in some pecorino but any firm or semi-firm cheese would do stir all that in get those garlic cloves mashed up and then taste for seasoning needs a little more salt and plenty of pepper some fresh herb will look and taste nice i'll scrape in a few time leaves there from lauren's plant stir once more and you could either split this filling between the two skins and have two thin potato pieces or you could pile it all in one skin and have one nice tall potato piece i'll do that don't need this other one now this one will bake one more time hence twice baked potato we'll also need a barbecue sauce for these ribs tomatoey barbecue sauce is usually either based on ketchup or on tomato paste and vinegar and sugar which is ketchup and because ketchup is strained or pulverized really fine the texture you get from it is super smooth and glossy i'll put in a spoonful of molasses like memphis style barbecue sauce you don't need it a big squeeze of mustard is great maybe some soy sauce you can just stir random stuff into ketchup and taste it until you like it a bunch of hot sauce in there then to evoke the taste of real smoked barbecue you could put in some liquid smoke or i'll just reach for smoked paprika one of my favorite spices stir that up and have a taste could use some more smoky paprika also some more pungency and more acid well guess what hot sauce is chilies in vinegar you just use vinegar everything we've done until now you could do way in advance this last part is quick and you do it right before dinner throw the ribs under the broiler that very hot top element there after a couple of minutes you should start to smell some very intense roasted steak-like aromas i'll pull those out and rotate them no sauce for me yet i want to dry out the surface texture a bit and get some nice dark brown flavor on these before i coat them in wet sugar can't brown them much after i do that now is a good time to throw in the potato again i do it right on the grate to keep the skin dry and crispy two or three minutes later all sides of the ribs have browned and now i'll put on some sauce you can just spoon it on but a brush allows you to paint on a very thin layer which is what i want i want a thin layer that will dry under the broiler keep an eye on it sugar burns very fast under the old grill after a couple of minutes i'll paint on a second thin layer it's kind of like building a piano finish in woodworking paint on some lacquer dry it sand it down paint on another layer this will get us lots of concentrated flavor from the sauce and the ribs won't be all wet and gloppy they'll be sticky get all those sides which we can access because the ribs are already cut into individual bones whole intact racks are just more convenient when you're feeding a bunch of people you can flip and baste them all together in one big piece but for a portion or two pre-cut ribs are great here's our beef flavored twice baked potato awfully nice crust on that and after just a couple more minutes under the grill check out how tight and dry these ribs look i love that laminated finish you could always have more of your sauce on the side some more thyme on there just for pretty might seem like a huge portion but remember like half the mass here is bone and gristle that you'll leave behind and we've cooked these so soft that the meat just slides off the other stuff into your mouth but again i was careful to not let the meat actually fall off the bone to me there's no point in ribs if you can't gnaw them off the bone yourself like a cave person sure the flavor isn't the same as real barbecue ribs that you smoked outside all day these are very different but still very good and way way easier,3
Eggplant vs. Aubergine vs. Brinjal — Why so many names?,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mQoNAR1um_c/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLCP66f967ZPeHPwOS3B2FKFtkzwAg,mQoNAR1um_c,"8 minutes, 57 seconds","Thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this video!

Of
all the world's commonly eaten plant parts, this one may have the most interesting name
— or names, plural. So very plural. Even if we restrict ourselves to English,
this thing still has at least three internationally common names in widespread contemporary current
use: ""Eggplant"" in North American English, ""aubergine"" in British English, and ""brinjal""
in South Asian English. Those are the big three names, but there are innumerable less-common
localisms. Like, here in the American South it was historically
referred to as ""Guinea squash."" ""Guinea"" as in West Africa. It may indeed
have come here via the transatlantic slave trade, but it could also have gotten here
via the Spanish. This may be another case of Europeans or Euro-Americans
naming anything ""exotic"" after Africa or India or the Turks who traded it to them. If they'd called it ""India squash,"" that may
have been more accurate. Botanists think this thing probably originated in South Asia. It
still grows wild across tropical Asia. It's a hot weather plant — and the part of it
we eat is technically a berry, by the way. But let's get back to the big three names,
and we'll start with the one I use — eggplant. People are quite understandably confused by
""eggplant."" What animal lays an egg that looks like that — a dragon? Well, it'll all make sense to you as soon
as I show you a different variety of eggplant that they also happen to have growing in this
garden. It's over here. Yep, that's an eggplant too and man does it
look like a goose egg or a big chicken egg, especially when it's pure white like that.
When the white varieties get really ripe they tend to turn yellow, but, yeah. That right
there is why people called it eggplant, or ""garden egg."" Some people in West Africa and
the Caribbean still call it garden egg. And ""eggplant"" remains the most common name in
the U.S. and Canada and Australia and New Zealand — though the first documented use
of that name here in the Oxford English Dictionary is from a British source in 1767. The OED
has no earlier reference to eggplant under any other name. That is the first documented mention of this
thing in English, it's from a Scottish author, and he used the word eggplant. Yet, for some reason, most contemporary Brits
call it ""aubergine."" ""Aubergine"" is a loanword from French that didn't cross the channel
until the turn of the 18th century, at least that's when the OED first finds it in English. But by then, it would seem, the name ""eggplant""
had gotten established here in the English colonies and we never let it go. Might this be linguistic evidence that the
white eggplant was the first eggplant variety introduced to Britain — and, by extension,
to the whole anglophone world? Maybe. I can't find any botanical source to the contrary.
Here's the Swiss French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau writing in French about botany in
the 18th century, and he actually drew a distinction between the white ""plante-oeuf"" — eggplant
— and the purple ""melongena."" ""Melongena"" was, and remains today, the scientific Latin
name for eggplant, solanum melongena. Rousseau also calls it the ""mad apple"" — ""pomme folle""
— a name based on the once common notion that eggplant is toxic and will drive you
insane. But here's what's actually insane. Mad apple,
melongena, aubergine — even brinjal, the contemporary Indian English name for this
— all of those names might be the same name, meaning they might all have the same common
ancestor. Nearly all of the non-eggplant-type names,
different as they sound, may come from the same place. And if this etymology is true,
it is also incredibly ironic. So here it is, according to the Oxford English
Dictionary, which seems to be drawing heavily from the Hobson-Jobson Dictionary, which is
a source a lot of people have questions about, but I have not found any linguist disputing
the broad strokes of what I'm about to tell you. Aubergine, the modern British English name,
came from French, where it in turn came from the Catalan Spanish name ""alberginia."" Now,
let me tell you something. From this point forward I am totally guessing
on the pronunciations. I have some idea of how these words would be pronounced today,
but I have no idea how they would have been pronounced back then. So I'm just guessing
— bare with me. ""Alberginia,"" both the name and the vegetable,
were brought to the Iberian peninsula by Arabs. The Arabs called it ""al-bāḏinjān."" To
this day, that is is a modern Arabic name for eggplant, and it evolved from an earlier
Persian name that evolved from and earlier Sanskrit name that may have meant ""food that
helps you not fart,"" and/or evolved from an Ancient Dravidian name, from South India. Regardless, if this is true, it means that
all of the names in the evolutionary chain that lead to aubergine all have the same common
ancestor from South Asia — just as the plants probably all have the same common ancestor
from South Asia. The name and the plant come from the same place. That's not the ironic
part. That part just makes sense. Here's where it gets ironic. Let's go back to the Arabic name, ""al-bāḏinjān.""
This is where the ""au"" sound in aubergine came from. It's a corruption of the Arabic
definite article ""al-"" meaning ""the"" — the bāḏinjān. As that Arabic name spread across North Africa
up into Spain and up across Europe, some people dropped the al- definite article. They dropped
the ""the."" So that's how we get the modern Spanish word
for eggplant, berenjena — ""alberenjena,"" ""the berenjena"" just became ""berejena."" In
Portuguese, it became ""beringela."" The Portuguese then exported their name, ""beringela,"" all
the way to their colonies in South Asia where it evolved into ""brinjal"" — the modern Indian
English name ""brinjal."" That's the ironic part. If you look at indigenous languages in South
Asia, there are names for this that descend much more directly from the original. But
if we look at ""brinjal,"" the modern Indian English word ""brinjal,"" it was born in India,
it traveled all the way up through Persia, all the way across North Africa, changing
all along the way, up into Europe, and then it sailed all the way back home aboard a foreign
conqueror's ship. Globalism! But wait, what explains ""melongena"" and that
whole ""crazy apple"" business. Well, when the Arabic bāḏinjān moved east across Europe,
the B sound at the beginning became an M sound — maybe because of how Bs were pronounced
in Greek, sort of an M and a P together. Anyway, that's how bāḏinjān became melongena,
or ""melanzana"" in Italian, which kinda sounds like ""mela insana"" — ""insane apple."" That false cognate in Italian may have been
what gave rise the notion that eggplant will drive you insane. Eggplant won't drive you
insane. It'll only drive you insane if you stay up way way way too late researching all
the different freaking names for this thing. I'm just kidding. I'm not ""mad"" about it.

pavlova pav the classic meringue dessert of australasia crispy on the outside marshmallowy on the inside i love it in the summertime my version replaces the traditional whipped cream topping with a pastry cream made from the leftover egg yolks i really prefer how the pastry cream tastes though it does present some hazards step one is get the oven heating to 350 fahrenheit 180c for a light dessert i think one egg serves two people i'm making a four egg pavlova and i'll separate out all the yolks just passing them gently between my hands until all the white slimes down through my fingers like i said save those we'll make our topping with them now beat these whites to soft peaks people say eggs need to be at room temperature they can't be cold when you whip the whites i think that's one of those rules that mattered back when people were whipping things by hand they whip a little slower when they're cold but i don't care because not for a million dollars would i make this dessert without an electric mixer there we go soft peaks just a couple of minutes now 50 grams of sugar per egg white i'm using powdered sugar and i am whipping it in a tiny bit at a time counter-intuitively this comes together way faster if you add the sugar very slowly you can dump it in all at once but then it takes a long time to whip it back to firm peaks a teeny bit at a time makes the job way faster yes i'm using powdered sugar lots of recipes say you can't use powdered sugar because it has a small amount of cornstarch in it to prevent clumping they tell you to use super fine sugar instead caster sugar which is hard to find in the states i did a side-by-side test with powdered sugar and a fine sugar that i made by running granulated sugar in the blender for 20 minutes both pavlovas came out the same and the one that i made with powdered sugar took way less time to mix ideally you want to mix the meringue until all the sugar is dissolved you can feel whether it's dissolved by just rubbing some meringue between your fingers if the sugar isn't dissolved the baked meringue is gonna weep or get little droplets of goo dripping off it you can make this with granulated sugar but to get it fully dissolved takes like a half an hour of mixing the powdered sugar dissolves almost instantly and when it's all in you can turn up the speed and beat this until you have stiff peaks which is still going to take a bit this took me another 10 minutes of whipping after i got the sugar in not stiff enough yet if it's not stiff the meringue won't hold its shape when you bake it it'll just melt and the inside won't be sufficiently aerated so it'll be dense and slimy not soft and pillowy those are some stiff peaks right there nice i'm sure it's possible to over beat this to the point where it would collapse but that would take a really long time this much sugar really stabilizes the foam though we can stabilize it further with some cornstarch i'm going to do half a teaspoon per egg white this makes the inside taste more like a marshmallow which i like too much will get you a meringue that is strong and keeps forever but tastes super chalky aka a cheap store-bought meringue another stabilizer is acid maybe half a teaspoon of lemon or lime juice per egg white this makes the meringue less likely to collapse in the oven and it tastes good we could have put it in at the beginning to prevent over whipping but that would have made the whipping take longer and the sugar made the overwhipping very unlikely anyway just mix those in along with a pinch of salt for taste some recipes tell you to dissolve that starch into the juice to make a slurry first i've tried that in a side-by-side test and it made no appreciable difference in the end this seems to whip in just fine as it is get a baking sheet line it with parchment the paper is totally essential here to prevent sticking some people trace a circle on it to guide them as they spread the meringue that is not a thing that i am going to do you can do all kinds of shapes and dimensions but the taller it is the more likely it is to collapse i think it's good to make a little well in the center for the filling and maybe a little fence around the rim to keep everything in really i just like spiky meringue don't worry there's no way those thin tips are gonna burn because we put this in the oven and then immediately reduce the heat to 215 fahrenheit 100c works good for me it gets an initial puff and then basically dries more than it cooks 90 minutes at very low temperature during which time you could watch a documentary on curiosity stream the sponsor of this video we're going to use a big splash of vanilla here in a second let's learn on curiosity stream how vanilla was first cultivated unlike

curiosity stream also while the pavlova is baking you can make this pastry cream which i would just eat in a bowl by itself it's pudding one tablespoon of granulated sugar per egg yolk and then a teaspoon of corn starch per egg yolk that's going to be a very thick paste at first but good the more viscous it is the easier it is to whisk out the lumps of corn starch if you don't have a tiny whisk a fork will do it got to be totally smooth now we're probably going to want like a quarter of a cup of water-based liquid per egg yolk 60 mls per yolk it could be water it could be white wine it could be milk cream i'm using evaporated milk which i really love it really smooths out the texture of things but i'm only measuring out three quarters of my expected amount i can always add i can't subtract and i want this thick dump that milk into a little saucepan on like medium-low heat and when it just starts to simmer whisk it directly into the egg yolk mixture tempering the eggs it's a fussy french technique that i've actually a b tested against just cooking things straight in the pan and i do think it helps prevent scrambled eggs speaking of which just keep whisking this constantly over real gentle heat like medium low we need to very slowly bring this up to a simmer if it's not thickening after a few minutes you could turn the heat up slightly but be careful because as soon as that cornstarch approaches the boiling point whoa whoa whoa turn that heat off and whisk like crazy i know that looks exactly like scrambled eggs but it's not scrambled eggs those are clumps of gelatinized starch not coagulated egg protein and you will be able to whisk them smooth see time to whisk in a tablespoon of butter per egg yolk half a stick in chunks so they melt a little bit faster the residual heat in the pan should be enough to do it you don't want to overheat the butter or the emulsion will break since i was conservative on my milk this is too viscous to whisk back into a liquid but we're on the knife's edge here watch what happens with just the addition of a big splash of vanilla that's enough to make this pudding again though by the time it chills it'll be way too thick to spread so i'll go ahead with the rest of my milk you can whisk in even more liquid later after it's chilled and get exactly the spreading consistency that you want the only thing you cannot do is thicken it back up again which is why i say start very thick cover that so that it doesn't develop a skin and chill now we just gotta wait for that meringue to be done when 90 minutes is up just turn off the heat and let it sit in there and dry for at least two hours ideally overnight it'll be more structurally sound the next day and the farty sulfur compounds in the eggs will off gas or break down or something you don't taste them as much the next day i had to shoot this on the same day that i baked it which is why this meringue was too delicate to peel off the paper that's fine just serve it on the paper i'll cut up my fruit topping right before i want to eat kiwi is of course the traditional favorite in australasia peel and then slice very thin i like kiwi for this because it's sour the meringue is super sweet so you eat it with tangy fruit and the two complete each other now pavlova is a very tricky dessert only if you demand that your meringues shall be totally uncracked when you eat it that's hard and judging by pictures on the internet people very rarely achieve uncracked perfection even if you do everything right there's variations with your oven or your eggs or your atmospheric conditions or the specific gravity of your topping that collapse actually never happened with my test bakes but hey if you don't want to risk it go with the traditional whipped cream it's lighter or you could fold pastry cream into whipped cream and get the best of both worlds these are raspberries by the way again i think soft sour fruits work best i really don't care about the collapse the meringue is going to start crumbling the instant you actually cut into it anyway it's possible to get a decent looking single slice like that but in general if you want really attractive single portions bake individual little pavlovas little plops of meringue on the baking sheet and no matter what size you do top the meringue right before you eat the topping will immediately start dissolving that cotton candy like crust i like how that pastry cream functions like a glue keeping all the parts together on their trip to your mouth which is right where they belong together,3

2017 United...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.183328, the other day i had a realization about why traditional recipes often require a bit of tweaking when you cook on the internet like i do every time you make something a little different from the way people have made it for generations you get the comments what do you think you're smarter than your grandma these recipes evolved over centuries you really think you know better and the answer is i think i know better about what kind of recipe will work for me and my life because my lifestyle is very very different than that of my ancestors if you have a device on which to watch this right now the same is probably true of you human life has never changed as rapidly as it has over the last century or so the tools that we have at our disposal the ingredients we have at our disposal and how we obtain them the time most of us spend working outside the home these things have all changed so much over the last few generations and they directly affect how we cook anyway i realized another one of these things recently another one of these things that explains why i cook differently than my grandma me and some extended family rented a condo on the beach as we do for a week every summer and when it was my night to cook i made spaghetti and meatballs always a crowd pleaser and without even thinking about it i found myself making it much closer to the way my grandma made it than the way that i usually make it you may have seen my old recipe video about this i usually make spaghetti and meatballs kind of the way you do swedish meatballs i make pretty small meatballs because i like to get more brown surface area proportionally on each one i usually don't use any egg in there i think egg is only necessary for binding big meatballs and when i'm done frying them in a pan i build my tomato sauce right there in the same pan it's a one pan operation deglaze stir stir stir constantly over pretty high heat and like 15 minutes after the tomatoes went in it's done when i was at the beach cooking for my in-laws the other day i used egg in the meat i formed it into absolutely giant meatballs i fried them in one pan and dropped them into my sauce in another pot and then i let the whole thing simmer for a couple hours just the way grandma origina did it and why because i was cooking for way more people than i usually do certain recipes and certain techniques work better for cooking at large quantities and certain things work better for cooking at small quantities and a few generations ago people often cooked in much larger quantities than we usually do today why because household sizes have absolutely plummeted at least here in highly developed countries like the united states and most of the places where you live according to my analytics we are simply living with fewer people under the same roof than our ancestors did this chart is from the pew research center average number of people per household according to u.s census data which is an amazing resource because it goes all the way back to the 18th century on average it used to be five or six people living under the same roof and cooking for each other every night now it's two or three people part of this of course is just people having fewer babies which seems to be an inevitable outcome of very high levels of economic development everywhere in the world where material prosperity rises and people have a lot of access to education and health care the birth rates plummet but in the us at least the decline in household size has outstripped even the decline in population growth if you normalized this pew chart for population growth rate household size would still show a decline over this period despite the fact that house size in the u.s has shot up like a rocket everywhere you go there's a corn field that somebody just littered with giant mcmansions in which hardly anybody lives like three or four people in one of these houses everybody gets a thousand square feet and of course it's not just the us here's a pretty recent united nations report quote average household size has declined almost everywhere these are just examples they have up here brazil france indonesia kenya but this trend has been going on in basically all but the very poorest countries and again decline in global birth rate is probably the biggest single factor but there are lots of other factors that are all intertwined with each other a rise in global material prosperity such that people just don't have to all be crammed in the same four walls anymore young people like most of you are delaying marriage and childbearing and living alone or maybe with one other person and when you cook you're cooking one or two portions instead of the five or six portions your great-grandparents are probably knocking out every night this is a very different cooking context for which i think the sponsor of this video is particularly well adapted hellofresh america's number one meal kit delivery my household has four humans in it but two of them are very small and they don't eat that much yet so we get meals for two boxes delivered and it's amazing how much this minimizes waste grandma could buy whole bushels of things and use them maybe in a night we usually can't so hello fresh sends us these little pre-portioned bits and bobs we don't have to stress about how we're going to use the leftovers and less waste is more sustainable the recipes are super quick great for modern life in which mom and dad both are working outside the home and great for the sweltering summer we're in now where we don't want to have the oven blasting inside for hours a day the broiled sweet potato pockets remain one of my favorite meatless meals but

adam ragusia14 for 14 free meals thank you hellofresh anyway yeah household size has been plummeting nearly everywhere for decades really the only one trend kind of pushing in the opposite direction has been the number of young adults living at home with their parents that's actually been going up recently especially with kovid pew here attributes this to declining employment prospects for young adults but if you're an educated person likely to have a strong career the odds are good that you'll not only leave mom's basement at some point you're gonna leave mom's town there's a good chance you're gonna move away far away to take some fancy job in the ever more specialized ever more globalized economy just like i did and that affected the way that i cook i mean grandma ragusia's immediate household was small it was just a post-war nuclear family living in the new long island shoebox suburbs and yet she still cooked massive dinners pretty frequently because the whole extended italian family still lived around new york and they would get together regularly to eat here's my dad it would be in the basement 25 to 35 people with everybody sitting around a table that was partly a real table and partly plywood on saw horses and everybody would be screaming at one another and arguing about politics and then it would all just sort of disappear as soon as the food hit the table hey frank pass me the meatballs come on get them over here it makes me really sad how few experiences like that i've had in my life dad went to grad school and moved far away from the extended family i went to grad school and moved far away from the extended family there's still times when i get together with aunts and uncles and cousins and nieces and nephews and we have a big dinner around a big table but that's like a once a year occurrence not a once a week occurrence still like i said at the beginning once a year we get together with my wife's side of the family and we do a big beach week and that's where i made spaghetti and meatballs for everybody not the way i usually make it but the way my grandma would have made it sure i think small meatballs generally taste better because they have proportionally more brown surface area but as i was shaping these i kept making them bigger and bigger because shaping and then browning enough tiny meatballs for a house full of people would have been way more work you only have so much surface area in your pan and tall meatballs pack more meat into that fixed area i got this all browned off in two batches the same weight of small meatballs probably would have taken four batches and instead of building my sauce right in the same pan like i usually do i did it over here in another pot just like grandma would have done why well again household sizes have changed a lot in recent decades but burner size and pot surface area have stayed about the same to cook down tomato sauce for 8 or 10 people in a 10 or 12 inch wide pot takes hours to cook down sauce for one or two people takes minutes this takes hours so i got the sauce going before i even started working on my meatballs it was just more time efficient that way to have it bubbling along in the background while i worked on the meat and when i got done browning all my meatballs in this pan i kind of didn't want to dissolve all of that fond and everything else in there into my sauce like i normally do these two batches of giant meatballs took a long time to fry off so that pan is full of little bits of onion and stuff that fell out and got burned i am very happy to leave all of that behind so i did what grandma did lifted the meatballs out and plopped them over here in the sauce in a different pot and since they were so big they did real well just braising in that sauce for hours they got cooked all the way through and they didn't get overcooked because i simmered this at a pretty low temperature when i do my small meatballs for two or three people i use high heat and stir aggressively the whole time to keep anything from burning on the bottom it's a bit of effort but again it's done in 15 minutes so who cares if i wanted to cook this giant pot of sauce and meatballs on high heat it would take a lot more physical effort to stir it and keep everything turning over on itself fast enough to ensure that nothing burns on the bottom and i would have to do that for way longer than 15 minutes it's much easier to just leave that giant pot on a low simmer and let it sit there mostly unattended for a couple of hours and i was able to watch it for a couple hours because it was vacation and i didn't have to go to work back in the olden days when households were huge you were more likely to have at least one person under your roof who wasn't working outside the home probably mom she was working in here all day long and as a result she was able to keep her eye on a low simmering pot for many many hours it was simply the case that those kind of long simmering dishes were more feasible for someone working at home in that context anyway my point is no i don't think i'm smarter than her i think that i'm just living in very different times may we all cook for the times that are given to us not someone else's,3

***RECIPE***

By...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.183328," Your basic basil pesto, pesto alla Genovese,
the paste from Genoa. One of the quickest and most delicious pasta sauces. I really
think it comes out better the traditional way, with a mortar and pestle, but you can
make it with just a knife. I'm gonna show you both ways, plus a handy trick for keeping
it green. I like one raw garlic clove per person. That's
my base unit. 1 part, by weight. Then I like about 2 parts nuts. Pine nuts are traditional
but any kind of nut will work. 2 parts cheese — pecorino, but parmesan would be fine.
Then, by weight, I want about 5 parts fresh basil leaves, picked off their stems. That's
just one portion, believe it or not. It's a basil-based sauce. And then you'll need
a little bit of salt, and just enough olive oil to turn it into a sauce. That's the traditional
ingredients, though the proportions vary a lot. These are just what I've found I like. First thing I'll do though is drop my pasta
into salted boiling water. The second you start to cut up the basil it's going to start
turning brown, so I want to make the pesto right before I eat it. The 10 minutes this
spaghetti is gonna take is plenty of time. Next thing is peel the garlic and start chopping
it up. Once I've got that going, I'll start bringing in the pine nuts, just chopping everything
as fine as I can get it. Once I've done about all I can do, I'll start bringing in the basil.
It's easier to chop if you bunch it up tight. Mow through that and then just hack indiscriminately.
Chop it as fine as possible. You could do this in the food processor — that gets you
results almost identical to the knife. I think I'd only do that if I was making a really
big batch. On goes my pile of grated pecorino. Might
as well chop those filaments up a little bit. Sprinkle over a little pinch of coarse salt,
and then here's something the food processor can't do — grind everything against the
board. Just push the side of the knife into those salt grains, which will act as an abrasive
and help smooth this out. The grinding helps smooth the nuts into a
paste and it squeezes green juice out of the basil. This gets you a more uniform green
color on the pasta, instead of just having specs of green. In a little bowl, and I'll
just mix in enough olive oil to get a saucy consistency. Like I said, this is one portion — maybe
two, depending on size and how heavily dressed you like your pasta, which is done — I'll
drain it, but not all the way. A little bit of pasta water in there is nice for the sauce
texture. Just stir that in, as much as you want. The
raw garlic cooks a little in the heat of the pasta, so I don't think a whole clove is overpowering.
Alright, pretty nice. The flavor is all there, but the texture and color isn't quite as good
as you get from the traditional mortar and pestle. The ceramic ones are really only good for
spices, I think. I'd recommend granite, like this — Italian or Thai style, with a rough
interior. If the inside is smooth and shiny, it can't grind pesto. Another option would be a molcajete — a
Mexican-style mortar and pestle. I really prefer the wider dimensions and they're very
abrasive. The igneous rock they're carved from is super porous, so you have to season
these before you use them, but the more you use them the better they get. This one I got in a kit from the sponsor of
this video, Bespoke Post. This is a company that just sends you monthly themed boxes of
cool stuff from under-the-radar producers. This one is called the Hecho — taco night
in a box. Molcajete for guac, one of those handy taco stands and a make your own hot
sauce kit? Cool! You take a quiz and tell Bespoke Post what
you're into — food, clothes, outdoor gear, whatever — and they curate boxes for you
from lesser-known small businesses. One I got was the Forge, this artisanal hunting
knife that I'll use this fall. I got the Dram — a box for a whiskey enthusiast. That's
me. You get assigned a box at the start of each
month, and before it ships you can decide to keep it, swap it or skip the month entirely
for no charge. You only pay for what you want and you can cancel your subscription whenever. The Al Fresco — a stone wine chiller and
a fun yard game to play. The boxes make great gifts too.

Yes I've decided to not break my pasta today. I'm branching out. Peel that garlic clove
and into the molcajete with a pinch of coarse salt to help grind it, and it's not traditional
but I think a tiny pinch of sugar really wakes pesto up. Just grind until it's virtually
liquified. A handful of pine nuts. Should you toast them
first? I've tried it both ways and I couldn't taste any difference in the final product,
so I say don't bother. Now look, see how the mortar and pestle is turning this into a nut
butter, like peanut butter? That's gonna make the pesto much creamier
on the pasta. This grinding effect cannot be achieved with a blade. Maybe if you filled
your food processor all the way up with pine nuts, but who needs that much? You can grind down whole basil leaves, but
I honestly find it easier to chop them first, just a little. This gives you a nice head
start, and it severs any long fibers that you can't break down through grinding. I'll
just get that started, though I'm not quite done with the basil yet. A big handful of grated pecorino in there.
And at this point, the earliest written recipe from Genoa calls for a little butter to be
mixed with the olive oil. I tried that — didn't taste much different to me. What I have found makes a big difference is
switching to a wooden spoon after I put in the oil. In Italy they've often do this whole
process with a wooden pestle. Grinding with wood just seems to do a better job of getting
that fine basil mince down into a true paste. This really squeezes that green juice out
that will color the whole strand of pasta. See how much creamier that looks compared
to our first batch? Drain the pasta, retaining just a little starchy water in there for the
sauce, stir that in and look how much more homogenous the color is. That's green pasta,
not just pasta covered in specs of green, and when you taste it, the texture is much
creamier — I think that's the pine nut butter that we were able to achieve in the mortar
and pestle. Much tastier. But now look. Look what happens
if I let this sit for about 10 minutes — it's gonna turn brown. This is an enzymatic reaction
in the basil that happens in the presence of oxygen. As soon as you cut the basil, the
browning starts to happen. If you seal up your pesto that helps a little,
but here's what really works. Before you drop the pasta in your salted boil water, drop
in the basil, just for a few seconds. Literally 10 seconds will denature the phenolase enzyme
in there. Just fish out those leaves with a slotted spoon or something and dump them
right into ice water, to stop the cooking. Now we have blanched basil, and that browning
oxidation cannot happen. I say throw the pasta right in the same water.
It's fine. Gather up the basil and squeeze it as dry as you can get it. Onto the board.
This time I'll use the granite mortar and pestle just so you can see that. I like is
one, I just wish it was wider. The Thai-style ones are really nice. Pinch of salt and sugar on my garlic clove,
grind that to a paste. In goes my pine nuts, but I've made pesto with almonds, pistachios,
they're all good. Pine nuts are expensive. Use whatever you've got. The granite is not
as coarse as the volcanic rock so this takes a little longer, but granite doesn't have
to be seasoned. Now, you gotta chop this basil very fine before
you put it in. When it's blanched it's slippery and the stone can't grip onto it very well.
You're not gonna get it much finer by grinding. You can just grind in a solid chunk of cheese,
though it's easier to grate it. Enough olive oil to make it a sauce, and then
I'll switch to the wooden spoon. I find the stone pestle does a better job of starting
pesto, the wood does a better job of finishing it. Still not as smooth of a puree as we had
before, because that blanched basil is just too slick, but the color is totally stable.
It won't brown. Grab my mostly drained pasta, stir that in,
and at this stage you might find you need more oil or water to loosen it up and that's
easy to do. There we go. I think it tastes a hair not as good as the version with raw
basil, but it's not a huge difference. And if I was making pesto for like a dinner party
or something, the blanched version would relieve a lot of time pressure. It's gonna stay green

1978 aquarium...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.183328, here's something that raises some profound questions about the nature of life there is a commonly eaten meat animal that is alive and remains alive as you eat it that's different from an animal that's alive when you start to eat it people eat all kinds of animals like that oysters probably being the most obvious example when you order that by valve at the restaurant it is fully intact and alive the chef opens it up or shucks it it starts to die but if it's shucked fresh it's still living when you suck it down at which point the animal dies in your stomach like one of jabba the hutt's minions in the sarlacc pit shouldn't take a thousand years though i'm not talking about an animal like that i'm talking about an animal that is alive when you start to eat it stays alive as you eat it and remains alive long after you've paid the check and gone home this animal survives the experience of being eaten by you and indeed might live to be eaten again by somebody else i'm not talking about some unicellular organism that lives in your gut i'm talking about a big complex animal with tissues and distinct organ systems and all of that it even has a face do you know what it is i'll give you a second to think about it it's crabs not all crabs but certain ones most commonly here in the united states it's this guy the stone crab millions of these animals are caught in traps off the florida coast every year and since there's almost no usable meat in their carapace the main central body there only the giant meaty claws are harvested i'm about to show you a video of this being done it's an educational video that was produced by the state wildlife agency in florida as meat harvests go this is probably about the least gruesome one you could possibly witness but content warning nonetheless here you go to harvest a stone crab claw first measure it from the elbow to the tip of the lower immovable portion of the claw if the claw is more than two and three-quarter inches in length it may be removed from the crab and the crab may then be returned to the water once tossed back in the crabs are theoretically able to survive thrive make baby crabs and even regrow their claws perhaps even to be harvested again indeed crabs in the wild frequently practice autotomy they self-amputate their own claw autotomize it this biological function is seen in a few animals typically as a means of predator evasion if you're a lizard and a hawk has you by the tail you just let the tail go and grow another one in its place but crabs are way better at this than lizards are when a lizard jettisons its tail the new one it grows back kinda sucks it's short it's stubby it doesn't have any bone no vertebra just some cartilage at the center it's more like a tail shaped scar than a true regenerated tail crabs on the other hand can regrow a real fully functional claw through their molting process crabs are also able to actively throw off their own limb whereas most lizards do it passively the tail is simply evolved to break away when a certain amount of external force is applied to it in contrast crustaceans can actually like actively eject their own limb it's a reflex action not something the crab does consciously to the extent that they have a consciousness which is a highly debated and not irrelevant topic regardless by actively throwing off the limb the animal is able to choose the specific point at which it breaks away or rather evolution has chosen it and that breaking point is not necessarily the weakest point the point most likely to break when pulled on by somebody else rather it's a point where there's a diaphragm that can close off the wound seal it you can see it there in this photo from that florida fish and wildlife conservation commission so if you're a crab in the surf and a shark has you by the claw the choice is clear if you're a shark in the surf i don't even want to know you but if you're surf

adam rogucia all one word that and my link are in the description 83 off thank you surf shark so the thinking among fisher folk historically went like this crabs deliberately jettison their claws all the time so it's all the same if we tear them off and eat them right it doesn't hurt the crab the crab lives to molt another day what could be more sustainable that's what people thought and then they started doing actual science 1978 these researchers at everglades national park collected about 200 healthy stone crabs they set the crabs up in some nice big aquariums ripped some of their arms off and then washed them of the crabs who lost both claws about half died the crabs who lost one claw about a third died when they died a majority died within 24 hours it was the trauma of having their claw torn off that killed them it was fluid loss the loss of their equivalent of blood that's in their tissues and consider this quote in the wild where declawed crabs must compete for food mates and shelter and avoid predators the mortality rate must be even higher and indeed it is it's been 40 years since that first study and several more studies have been done the stone crab industry became a big one in florida food-related science generally follows the money and the money has been great money is the dotted line on that chart but the catch has not been great the catch is the solid line landings the money is only up because people are paying more this graph is from a pretty recent study by the florida wildlife commission rather than observing crabs in aquaria they did it in big pens out here out where the crabs actually live along the gulf coast they declawed some and then watched them over the whole 2011-2012 season in that time 40 percent of the one-armed crabs died 60 percent of the no armed crabs died the scientists of course had a control group a group of crabs that got to keep their claws and of those 13 died over the course of the study period because nobody lives forever but having their claws torn off definitely dramatically increase the odds of mortality and what's worse higher temperatures seem to increase the odds of dying once they have their claws torn off here's a master's thesis by university of south carolina student jessica hogan she found that even when crabs survived the declawing trauma they still don't do that great in the wild they have trouble cracking open the shellfish they like to eat and energy they could be putting toward reproduction seems to be getting diverted into regrowing that claw speaking of the new claw what are the odds that you can eat a stone crab claw and then some years later somebody eats the claw that the crab regenerated in place of the one that you ate what are the odds of getting a second harvest out of the crab three percent according to another study here out of south carolina in their mark in recapture studies only three percent of the crab successfully regrew a claw of legally harvestable size now part of that is just down to the natural lifespan of the crab which simply isn't that long it's hard for a crab to naturally live long enough to grow two really big meaty claws in succession even still yeah these numbers are kind of bad but then again bad compared to what the mortality rate of beef cattle is a hundred percent these guys have a zero chance of survival anything is better than those odds where there's life there's hope and let's remember nothing goes to waste in the ocean say i buy some other kind of crab and i cook it whole the whole animal dead in my steamer basket i eat the meat from the claws because that's the easiest meat to get at and there's not so much great meat in the carapace the body and especially since i'm not an experienced picker i'm really not able to get that much out of it so most of it goes in the trash and then where does it end up probably in a sealed landfill somewhere in contrast a stone crab loses its claw and gets thrown back under the waves even if it dies at least it stays in the ecosystem it becomes some other critter's dinner and the research indicates that stone crabs have a much better fighting chance at life if we remove their claws properly the fisher folk have to break the claws along that diaphragm that seals off the wound again from that florida wildlife commission vid care should be taken when removing the claw so as to not permanently injure the crab to hold the crab take both claws make sure you have both proposes firmly in hand and with the right hand i'm just going to make a motion straight down which is a good break now i bet i know what you're thinking you're thinking is the crab suffering does an animal with such a small brain and simple nervous system have the capacity to experience pain in anything like the way that we do well this is a never-ending scientific and social controversy crabs have been shown to recoil from physical danger and avoid situations in which they've been harmed in the past whether that's just an instinct or a reflex or evidence of consciousness nobody knows for sure i do know that when people eat bigger brained animals we generally try to extinguish whatever consciousness they may have before we start cutting them up at least in modern industrialized meat packing a cow for example is knocked first knocked and if somebody gave me a choice i would definitely opt for being knocked but again with a crab there's always the possibility they could survive the process of becoming dinner lose limb or lose life what do you think if you're a crab let us know in the comments which you'd prefer,3

Free shipping within the United...,2022-12-01 14:47:05.183328, farming mushrooms is very different from farming nearly any other kind of food because of course mushrooms aren't plants or animals the act of growing mushrooms looks and feels much more like growing bacteria in a lab fungi aren't bacteria either they're their own kingdom of life but the bacteria analogy holds in as much as a mushroom farm is much more laboratory than it is field there is no field because mushrooms don't need light at least not in the same way that plants do they aren't photosynthesizing anything they're not vegetables certainly lots of different kinds of mushrooms are cultivated lots of different ways by lots of different people i'm just showing you one example today middle georgia mushroom in macon georgia hunter pruitt his grandmothers and his girlfriend anna grow mostly oyster and lion's mane mushrooms for local restaurants we're bringing fresh gourmet mushrooms to middle georgia first step is to prepare a substrate that is the substance on which the fungus will both grow and feed it lives inside its food ain't that the dream in the wild mushrooms can grow in the ground specifically ground that has lots of biological material in it like old dead leaves or they can grow on dead trees decaying wood hunter replicates the dead wood substrate by using sawdust pellets these are usually a byproduct of sawmills people use them as fuel for grills and smokers even home heating stoves once this stuff is hydrated it turns into just the mushroom's paradise right mushrooms in the wild grow on hardwood species so we found out that these pellets work just as good as that hardwoods are basically the trees that aren't pine type trees conifers have that sticky christmas-smelling resin in them which has anti-fungal properties for that same reason people don't usually cook with soft woods they burn really dirty you end up with food that's coated in this kind of bitter soot so generally speaking wood that is good for cooking can also be good mushroom substrate and what this is is we've taken those pellets we've put them in that bag and we've put in a certain amount of water and we let that water absorb in that pellet and it comes out to this nice nice little block the problem of course is that block is probably full of random microorganisms microorganisms that could grow in the very favorable conditions of hunter's mushroom fruiting chambers so we bring it over and we put it in this big ol barrel we call this our atmospheric steam sterilizer it's basically a big tank with a heating element at the bottom hunter loads the sealed bags in there and pasteurizes them at 204 fahrenheit 95 c for 18 hours what we're doing is just running steam up through the blocks and it's just heating that block up to 200 degrees which is going to kill all that content that competition those competitive organisms the bags come out totally sterile and then it's time to inoculate them with the fungus that you actually do want to grow in there from here on out everything has to be done in an ultra sterile environment the air is full of yeasts and molds and bacteria and other things that could out-compete hunter's mushrooms in that substrate so there's there's one mold that mushrooms growers are just fighting every day and that's trichoderma it's it's your green mold it's your common mold that you find on breads it loves to eat the same kind of substrates as as mushrooms so everything he does now he will do while standing in front of this flow hood what this does is it pulls air from the back pushes air forward and pushes through this hepa filter those jars he is sterilized in a pressure cooker everything else he's going to spray with isopropyl alcohol cut with water a 70 solution so it doesn't evaporate too fast kind of spray your hands down spray your surface spray your bag here's what hunter is starting from today some mushroom culture that he has ordered you can grow mushrooms from their spores their seeds or you can grow them from mycelium cultures and the latter is generally regarded as the more reliable method the mycelium is the main body of the fungus these white filaments that grow inside the substrate in that syringe she has little bits of mycelium floating around in a sugar water solution that the mycelium can eat and he's injecting it into jars with even more sugar water it's a one to four ratio of water and light corn syrup so the mycelium actually grows on the sugars that are in the syrup go in the jar we'll do about two and a half milliliters what he's doing here is expanding the culture that he's ordered putting it in an environment where it can rapidly grow so it'll have lots more of it and so it will last until he needs it the other advantage of liquid culture is that the mycelium won't grow a mushroom in there it has no structure to hold on to we have a mag a little stir bar and what that stir bar is is just a magnet we put it on the stir plate and what that is is gonna break that mycelium up that way it can spread throughout the jar look at that magnet spin super cool way to stir something without potentially contaminating it and within seven to 14 days this jar is going to be fully colonized similar to this that's the thing about growing fungus instead of plants everything happens way faster given the right conditions mycelium can expand almost as fast as a brand new mattress from the sponsor of this video helix sleep let me thank them helix is a premium mattress in a box company i've been setting

jar with liquid culture he's got to sterilize the needle he's got to work clean we're going to turn our heat off keep it in front of that hood let it cool down squirt a little out cool it off bring it in now before hunter can grow mushrooms from his liquid cultures he needs to test them first and he does that on petri dishes little plates covered with agar agar call me agar if there are contaminants in the culture they will present themselves much more readily in the petri dish they'll be able to grow and the mycelium can actually grow into a full-fledged fungus in there so he's also looking to find particularly strong genetic specimens groups of mycelium that are so good at growing and being alive that they are out competing other groups and you can see how it's there's no kind of synchronization with this mycelium there's just groups growing everywhere right so what we do is we would find a very healthy looking group like some of this rhizomorphic here some of the edge of this and we'd cut it and we'd transfer it to another dish that way we can grow that good strong isolation that we all hunt after so you if you can get one good genetic growing you can multiply that genetic tenfold and then that can be your genetic on your farm that you know how it grows in a certain temperature how long it takes to fruit how long it colonizes you know everything about that thing in contrast look at this one you can see that's not several different fungi all battling it out that's one coherent organism that hunter has successfully isolated you can also clone a fungus you like by just chopping off a piece of the fruiting body the actual mushroom there and putting it in agar hunter does that too here's a clone of a lion's mane mushroom that actually started growing a new fruiting body inside the dish it's actually just a suffocating fruiting body you can see that it's coming out and it's reaching for oxygen so mushrooms are just like us they actually uh they inhale oxygen and produce co2 so they're they're closely related to the us humans and he's looking for some oxygen that's why he's stretching out like that as we've discussed previously fungi are actually closer to animals than they are to plants i have a whole video about what exactly mushrooms are it's linked in the description next step is for hunter to use the genetic specimens he's isolated to inoculate jars of grain those are literally just whole grain oats in there pretty much any kind of seed works fungi likes seeds basically for the same reason that you and i do they're nutritious again he's just expanding his culture growing more of it and making sure it's pure that it hasn't been contaminated by some bread mold or something everything's white there is no different greens and blues and pinks the other great thing about starting your mycelium in grain is that it's granular you now have lots and lots of tiny little bits of things that are individually seeded with your fungus the thing important to farmers is how many different vehicles of inoculation you have you have probably i don't know five thousand six thousand kernels in this jar and it's going to get mixed into a big old bag of sawdust and that grain is going to be distributed through that sawdust so the grain spawn that's what that's called the grain spawn goes into the sterilized bags of wood pellets and he lets the mycelium grow in there for a week or two yeah you can see this thing is fully colonized ready to go and then you'll just get you a sharp object and you'll slit that that bag right there and from here she'll go into the chamber we'll place that block up and uh somewhere around 14 days she'll be uh she'll be fruit and some oysters that fruiting chamber is where the mycelium will grow an actual mushroom it'll come up out of that slit in the bag first they come out as little dots like that those are called pins or pinheads about a day later they might look like that then it's off to the races this will be about that size tomorrow and then it'll come in it'll be about that size on day three they are insanely fast growers and over that time hunter has to watch his fruiting bodies and manipulate the environment of his fruiting chamber accordingly so mushrooms in the beginning stages like very high humidity whereas mushrooms throughout their life as they start pinning require much more lower humidity you can see this for yourself out in your lawn it rains and then you see a bunch of mushrooms sprout when it's really humid and then if the air doesn't clear if it stays really wet or if it stays really stagnant those mushrooms will rot really really fast alternatively if things get too hot and too dry the mushrooms just shrivel up they're like 90 water so in general they like really humid somewhat dim conditions that doesn't mean they don't like sunlight some mushroom species use light as a signal or a trigger for growth the precise reasons and mechanism for this are things that are still being worked out by science what we found and i believe this is probably debatable is that mushrooms actually use sunlight as just a sense of direction that draws them towards oxygen so if you think that you know with all natural light occurring the sun being the highest point the organism knowing that they say if i can get to the sun then i can reach the oxygen and once the mushroom cluster is full grown he's got to cut it off the block right away the mushroom is the funguses temporary reproductive appendage its job is to grow up tall really fast cast the spores into the wind and then just die back you really got to pay attention to him because if you let them get to a certain point when that cap starts to open up and those spores start to drop this room is going to be a mess man your fans are going to get clogged up and your this your humidifier will get get all nasty the lion's main mushroom drops its spores from those little teeth you can tell it's ready when they get long long in the tooth this one right here is past its harvest prime but i love the way this thing looks man it's still totally edible so you can really see that this mushroom has a stringy crab like barbecue pulled pork like like texture once hunter harvests the fruit cluster he can grow another one from the same block that's called a flush he can generally get three flushes from a block though they get progressively smaller and more susceptible to contamination from a random mold floating by the nutrients start to disperse in the block so it doesn't have a lot of food the army becomes weaker right can you tell hunter is a veteran all the combat metaphors when the army becomes weaker and a new fresh contamination comes in that contamination's a lot of times gonna gonna win right it's gonna take over that block and it's gonna be able to make its little stronghold at that point the block goes in the compost and the whole process starts again he sells these inoculated blocks on his website it's a kit that you can grow at home i did that there's a link in the description a common trait that i've noticed among mushroom growers is they tend to be evangelists they believe in the power of fungus its power to be a medicine its power to be a sustainable protein source even its power to filter pollutants out of the environment we want to turn this into a community thing we want it to be a farm you know we want this we want this to expand and to uh into some land and and to really um and to really grow the awareness for fungus right in our community might sound grandiose but i don't think it is that lion's mane for example has been shown in my studies to promote neurogenesis the growth of new brain or other nerve cells hell it even looks like a brain and it's been shown to improve cognitive function in geriatric mice maybe it'll improve cognition in a geriatric me in a few decades we'll see in the meantime i'mma keep eating them thanks to the hard work of laboratory farmers like the folks at middle georgia mushroom go get you some,3

video about sensodyne here's some steps for converting nearly any cookie recipe that you like into homemade ice cream sandwiches i'm just starting from my own chocolate chip cookie recipe or rather i'm making a half batch with the extra bulk of the ice cream you really only need a half batch a stick of butter fully melted 4 ounces 113 grams 200 grams 1 cup of brown sugar or a cup of white sugar topped off with a glug of molasses because that's all brown sugar is big splash of vanilla and i'm doing a heaps teaspoon of kosher salt like six grams try extra salt in your cookie recipe salty cookies with ice cream is a life-changing combination one egg beat that smooth to where you get those nice ribbons then i'll prepare my dry ingredients and my chunks i've got about six ounces 170 grams of mixed white and dark chocolate chips before i put these in i want to chop them into smaller chunks that won't hurt my teeth when they're hard and cold basically my whole adult life i've had really temperature sensitive teeth which is a drag when eating and drinking and cooking is kind of your whole thing you just get these little flashes of pain when you eat very cold or hot things as a result the prospect of diving front teeth first into an ice cream sandwich can be a little daunting the pleasure but the pain but the pleasure so i'm brushing with sensodyne specifically sensodyne rapid relief you brush with this twice a day and in as little as three days you can get some relief from those painful little twinges i totally feel the effect and it's awesome i no longer fear you sir sunday is national ice cream day here in the states so gear up for it life is too short for sensitive teeth use sensodyne and go back to enjoying ice cream without the pain of sensitivity thank you sensodyne now i'm putting in a teaspoon of baking powder that's a little extra leavening it'll help lighten the texture when this cookie is hard and cold and flour starting with just a cup of all-purpose flour 120 grams that's less than i normally put in i want this dough to be really wet and sticky so it'll spread nice and thin in the oven i hate ice cream sandwiches that are so thick you dislocate your jaw trying to eat them that's too sticky a little more flour and yeah that's good go for a texture that's noticeably wetter and stickier than how your recipe normally feels in goes my chopped up chocolate chunks and then i would normally chill this dough so that it doesn't spread too fast and too far in the oven but for a sandwich i want it to spread as thin as possible so straight this goes into a parchment-lined baking sheet gotta have excess parchment on each side so we can lift the cookie sheet out after it's baked and it helps to spray the metal with non-stick ironically so that the paper will stick to it a little bit and lie flat you can also make it lie flatter by making diagonal cuts of the corners that allows the excess of the corner to overlap like that and any excess that's going to curl into the cookie you can just trim off time to drop the dough in dollops if you space out the dollops you reduce the distance over which you will now have to spread this very sticky viscous substance nice gentle pulling strokes with the back of the spatula i find it helps to think of it as painting the cookie dough as thin as you can get it if it looks like you don't have enough to cover the whole pan i'd recommend working it all the way to one edge one side at least you'll get nice clean edges on that side the other side we can trim later okay in the oven you go with your normal temperature this is 375 fahrenheit 135c and i would lean on the side of it being under baked that'll make it softer and easier to cut into sandwiches without shattering it that was only like five minutes in there and while it's still hot and pliable lift the sheet out of the pan see no breaking no cracking because it's still soft now you can let it cool all the way down and solidify it's fully cooled now first thing is to cut it in half the top and bottom sheets i'll follow the natural diagonal bent that it came out with and then i'm going to need to lift the top sheet off the paper so i'm just sliding under it with my knife to pry it off once it's dislodged i'm going to use my scissors to cut the parchment in half i can use the paper to lift up the top sheet later take your ice cream out a little in advance and it's a spreadable texture when you can just pinch the carton kind of like that drop on scoops of whatever flavor you want i'm alternating chocolate and vanilla scoops when they're pressed together these will give me a nice kind of marbled effect i love doing this with cookie sheets instead of individual cookie pears because i can do it so much faster and speed matters when the ice cream is melting rapidly two full pints of ice cream will fit between these sheets that's almost a liter then very carefully i'll lift up the top sheet by its paper turn it out onto my hand i need it to be upside down so that now i can reverse it and plop it right down onto the ice cream top side up once there it's time to very gently push compress that ice cream and close all the gaps between the scoops if the ice cream isn't soft enough just let it sit there for a minute and try again you should see it start to squeeze out the sides like well toothpaste now real quick that whole sheet has to go in the freezer to chill solid once it's totally firm you can safely cut it up into sandwiches which you could do with or without cleaning up the edges first trimming off any uneven sides trimming is a little wasteful but personally i've never hesitated to lay so great a sacrifice at the altar of aesthetics anyway when it's time to actually cut these into squares i find i get much cleaner cuts if i saw with my knife a little bit at first just until the knife has bitten down through the really brittle cookie surface once you've done that you can push straight down without much risk of cracking you could individually wrap these in plastic but i'm doing little sheets of parchment paper you might have noticed i didn't flip the bottom cookie sheet before i stacked it with ice cream you could do that but i like for the bottom of the sandwich to be the bottom of the cookie sheet it gives you some textural contrast with the smooth shiny top sadly i do think it's best to chill these one more time before you eat them if the ice cream isn't really cold the jaw force necessary to bite through the cookie will cause the ice cream to squeeze out the sides like well toothpaste thanks again to sensodyne for sponsoring this video brush with that and get to enjoying an ice cream summer the way it was meant to be enjoyed,3

***RECIPE, FEEDS 1-2 PEOPLE***...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.183328, there are lots of small birds on the market with which you can make an adorable mini fried chicken for one or two people smaller pieces are way easier to fry anyway you could do a cornish hen in the states they have them frozen at most grocery stores or you could do what i'm using squab a pigeon that's just over a pound maybe half a kilo if it comes with any organ meats those are good to fry too step one is to use kitchen scissors to cut out the spine this is much easier to do on a tiny bird than on a big chicken snip up one side of the backbone and then the other hey they left the neck connected i've got the whole central nervous system minus the brain save that for stock or something now we've got a spatchcocked pigeon i want to split that along the two sides of the breast on a chicken i would put my knife in the little groove along the breastbone there but the breastbone on this bird is convex not concave so i'll flip it around and then cut from the other direction maybe saw a little bit just to get the knife securely seated in a groove then i can just push down on the spine of the knife with a small bird it's easy to crunch through even these big bones two pieces look at that breast meat pigeon is 100 dark meat which makes it great for breading and frying it's virtually impossible to overcook time to separate the leg quarters from the breast quarters just feel for the natural split between them and crunch right through the hip joint which again real easy to do on a small bird proportional to the breasts the leg quarters on a pigeon are very small so you could leave the leg and the thigh connected but i just want to see that tiny little drumstick so i'll cut those off i usually cut into the crook of the knee and then pull it apart to expose the joint so i can see exactly where to push my knife through the wings are proportionally small too so i'm going to cut those off with a big piece of breast attached just cutting straight through the bones there and then with the remaining piece of breast i'll cut that in half too three pieces from each side of the breast that breast is where most of the meat is on a pigeon i'm going to rinse these pieces off just to get rid of any tiny bone fragments dry those pieces on towels and then rather than do the southern buttermilk soak thing i'm gonna dry brine these pieces cover them in enough salt to season the meat and the breading pepper two and maybe a little garlic and onion powder the breading on top will protect that from burning toss that all around i think buttermilk brine makes better flavor but dry brine makes crispier texture and a lighter coating if my coating isn't light on these tiny pieces the breading to meat ratio will be way off skin side up so the skins can dry and then in the fridge this goes uncovered for at least an hour overnight is better dry skin means crispier pieces i'm going to have this with a potato salad yeah it's a carb heavy meal so let's balance that with a breakfast from magic spoon the sponsor of this video magic spoon is this company that sends you boxes with all of your childhood favorite

potatoes and i'll boil them whole meanwhile i can chop up a couple of green onions they're going to be basically raw so i'm being careful to slice very thin down in the whites where they're pretty firm and strong one small garlic clove it's going to be raw and raw garlic is extremely powerful just a little finely minced for my dressing i'm going to use a lemon but you could use vinegar half a lemon is probably more than enough for most people but you know about me and acidity then olive oil in the u.s potato salad is usually dressed with mayonnaise but you can use any salad dressing this is my basic mustardy vinaigrette a little upside down bear brain stir that up the whole grain mustard is a good emulsifier and mustard goes great with potatoes ask the germans potatoes are done when you can just barely pierce them to the core with a sharp knife pull them out let them cool for a sec and then dice them up see how the skins are slipping off i cook these a little too long i don't want mashed potatoes i want them to hold their shape get a big bowl dump everything in season conservatively with salt and pepper i can taste and adjust in a sec pour in some dressing again conservatively i can always stir taste and add more needs a little more dressing no more salt check this out cilantro with a u instead of an eye they happen to have this at my store it tastes exactly like cilantro coriander leaves but it has a crunchy texture like a salad green rather than an herb that should be a lovely addition an hour sealed in the fridge and this will taste like potato salad but a day or two is better the flavor improves i'm gonna bread my pigeon in equal parts ap flour and starch this is potato starch but cornstarch would do it a little spoon of baking powder is nice too stir that up and that mixture will create a very light breading which again won't overwhelm the tiny pieces of meat the baking powder will contribute some air and the starch will disrupt the gluten structure of the flour super light and crispy gotta beat an egg one is really too much but they don't sell half eggs yet make sure you beat it really well to loosen it that way it won't be too thick on the meat here's the dry brine pieces i'll dust those in just a little of my flour mixture and toss this is just to give the egg something to stick to coat that in just enough egg to make them wet all over whoops that's too much i'm gonna get cakey breading problem solved now just enough of the flour to get a nice powdery coating everywhere the smaller the vessel we fry in the less oil we have to waste and dispose of i've got a tiny little eight-inch skillet non-stick is nice the pieces can stick to the bottom but it's not super necessary oil in peanut oil is my favorite neutral oil these days it can get real hot without stinking up the house i'll heat that to no more than 300 fahrenheit 150 c even with mini fried chicken i like to fry chicken very gently at least at first that piece may be fizzing more aggressively than i want it to but by the time i fill this tiny pot with all my pieces the temperature is going to drop a lot smaller pieces in last so they don't overcook that kind of gentle fizzing i think makes the best pan-fried chicken that is chicken that is only halfway submerged in oil as opposed to deep-fried chicken yes i know it's a pigeon but i'm using pigeon to make a dish called fried chicken when the bottoms are just barely golden i'll start flipping if you want them darker brown than that you can crank the heat at the very end but if you go slow you give them meat time to cook all the way through and to soften a bit before anything has any chance of burning plus i think pale blonde color on the crust really does taste best but that's just me the pigeon is all dark meat right so if you judge doneness by the color that the juices run they're probably never going to run clear like they do from white meat i'm just looking for the juice to go from bright pink to reddish brown brick i'll flip everything some more right at the end there to make sure every surface is crisp use a thermometer to be safe taste wise i think 175 fahrenheit is the minimum temperature for dark meat adc i prefer it a little hotter than that but these are tiny pieces encased in hot oil so they're going to keep cooking as they sit on the draining rack and rest got to account for that i like potato salads because they're all in one size veg and starch and sauce all in one dish the acid of the dressing will cut the richness of the meat remember the breast pieces are really the only ones with much meat at all if you're using a pigeon but i just love that micro machine drumstick super crispy and done in way less time and in less oil than if we had fried a big chicken look at that that's the breast meat pigeon is awesome get a little tart salad with that bite grocery stores here in the states usually have a frozen poultry bin with lots of unusual options choose a tiny bird and fry it up it'll make you happy,3

the oldest domesticated bird used for food and various other vital functions since ancient egypt and mesopotamia and probably long before that pigeons are tasty birds the ones roosting up in those girders up there are probably descended from birds that were brought here to the americas expressly as a food source if that surprises you that's probably because you are like me a long time resident of a highly developed urbanized country where pigeons have developed a reputation as being dirty rats with wings people call them but this idea that pigeons are particularly gross or unpleasant is really very recent and i think it's fair to say inaccurate pigeons are as pure and gentle as doves how do i know that because doves are pigeons pigeon pigeon is literally just the french word for dove there is no scientific distinction between them they're all columba forms an order of stout little bird species with plump bodies little necks little feet little everything really other than their meaty breasts in english we colloquially use dove to describe smaller and sometimes lighter colored species of columbidae and we use pigeon to describe the bigger species but there's really no consistency to it it would have been just as accurate a translation to say lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the spirit of god descended like a pigeon pigeons are holy all through human history they were beloved they were worshipped as fertility goddesses as the image of the holy ghost of jesus christ that is andrew blechman author of pigeons the fascinating saga of the world's most revered and reviled bird and while there are more than 300 species of pigeon blackman in his book here is chiefly concerned with the domestic pigeon that we see up in that overpass pigeons or descendants of pigeons that have been bred by humans over thousands of years for various qualities there's a there's a annual pigeon pageant that's kind of like the westminster dog show except for uh nobody attends it except for the pigeon people it's not televised uh but you've never seen never seen pigeons look anything like this but just as the incredible variety of domestic dogs we know all have the same basic wild ancestor wolves all these domestic pigeons are descended from this guy the rock pigeon or rock dove their native range is in dark red there the pink is everywhere that humans have introduced them in large numbers it's a symbiotic relationship ever since we had agriculture they would basically eat the leftover seeds you know that dropped on the ground and uh we find them in cities because they typically are they live on cliffs they don't you don't see pigeons and trees they don't do trees and our our cities are nothing but basically concrete cliffs everywhere and so that's why they're attracted to our cities indeed part of the reason domestic and wild rock pigeons look so similar is that they are similar we didn't really do that much to domesticate them the rock pigeon is naturally a perfect livestock animal they breed prolifically they naturally hang out together in huge dense flocks and they are extremely gentle and social these are the classic traits of a species that practice what biologists call predator satiation the main way they avoid being eaten is to occur and congregate in such huge numbers that the raccoons couldn't possibly eat all of them or the humans i suppose all through medieval europe and before actually going back to the ancient persians and mesopotamia you'd have dove coats or dove cots which are you know cylindrical buildings with little holes in them inside and they would roost inside and then it was a source of year-round protein usually the royalty would do it but you could just kind of pluck a bird when you were ready dovecotes were also part of the other primary use that humans have historically had for pigeons and that is as messengers pigeons have remarkable homing abilities that scientists still don't fully understand it might have to do with their awareness of the sun or maybe with a smell they can smell their way around or it might actually be their awareness of the earth's gravitational fields but regardless you can take a pigeon and take it hundreds of miles away from the roost where it was born let it go and it will find its way straight home where it was born so imagine that you're an ancient army going out on campaign when you leave the seat of your power you take some pigeons with you from your dove coat and you march away with them and then when it's time to send news of your victory home or to plead desperately for reinforcements you write a little scroll you tie it to the pigeon's leg and you just let it fly home the ones that are bred for racing they can travel 600 miles to their loft their home law like like a lazy laser guided missile from 600 miles away without stopping for food water or rest from a place they've never even been before at 60 miles an hour this explains why pigeon breast meat looks like this bright red full of myoglobin and slow twitch muscle fibers optimized for long-term sustained effort just like beef culinarily pigeon is a red meat and tastes good when cooked rare same as duck breast oh like the pan it's from the sponsor of this video misen let me thank them real quick somebody asked me recently what basic pan i would recommend to a young person starting out and i said misen's 10 inch stainless steel skillet if that story wasn't true i wouldn't have volunteered it just now as far as i know no other stainless pan on the market for this little money is so robustly constructed this thing is heavy and solid the oven-proof handle feels really comfortable and secure in your hand it's the ideal five-ply sandwich of metals with aluminum alloy inside for rapid heating and stainless on the outside for easy cleaning and maintenance and the edges are steep which means you get a wider surface area than cheaper pans that literally cut corners follow my link in the description use promo code regucia for 20 off your first order from mizin on this pan or anything again my link and code in the description save 20 on your first order thank you mizin and maybe that pink pigeon breast grosses you out but i guarantee you it is making some french person real excited right now is it safe to eat like that well i've only been able to find one study and it's 20 years old but these researchers at uc davis found salmonella and campylobacter levels on commercial pigeon farms to be extremely low compared to chicken and turkey farms but now you may be thinking wait a minute that sentence doesn't say anything about pigeon it's talking about squab i guess in the culinary world they refer to it as squab which is a scandinavian word for basically fat and juicy most pigeons that are eaten are um they're baby pigeons they're basically the milk fed veal of the sky yeah so this is the kind of sad part a squab is a pigeon that has grown really big and fat but it has not yet become fully fledged meaning it is not yet flown out of the nest as soon as the bird starts flying it loses weight rapidly and the meat gets tougher and perhaps most significantly it becomes way harder to catch to harvest a squab all you do is pick it up or if it's in the wild up in a high nest or something you can reach up with a long pole and just knock it out of the nest there are accounts of native americans using exactly that technique to hunt the pigeon species that is indigenous to this continent which is the passenger pigeon these are not passenger pigeons these are descended from domesticated rock pigeons brought here 400 years ago by european colonists this is the last known passenger pigeon martha she died in 1914 in the cincinnati zoo passenger pigeons recalled that because they passed by they migrated in vast flocks from their breeding zone in red there to the forests in orange where they would feast on the fruits and nuts of trees the story of how people drove the passenger pigeon to extinction is virtually identical to the story of how we almost drove the american bison to extinction i have a whole video about that in the description basically habitat destruction vast vast commercial hunting that was enabled by the growth of railroads and farmers shooting them down in huge numbers to keep them from feasting and pooping on the crops and here we come back where we started the very recent turn of events in which pigeons came to be regarded in some places as dirty and that really comes from uh post-world war ii there was a just a giant increase in prosperity in the western world particularly united states actually since given that we had won the war we were damaged like the rest of europe was by the war and so post-world war ii the economy grew dramatically food became very cheap there was also you can buy bread in the grocery store cost you know pennies um and as food got really cheap so uh a lot of it would end up on the ground you know there was a lot of waste whether it was in the trash or if you would just you know kind of end up on the ground just like pizza crust and donuts do today so the same thing and so the more food that was available the more pigeons you would have and also than something that seemed kind of you know cute and would animate you know urban life seemed less cute when there was more of them pigeons roosting on buildings in huge numbers means huge piles of poop underneath them pigeons don't poop especially more than other birds and their poop isn't especially hazardous there are simply more pigeons among us and they congregate in big groups and everybody poops as andrew blechman puts it pigeons are simply as clean or as dirty as our cities are probably best not to eat the ones in the park though ernest hemingway purportedly did just that when he was poor living with his young family in paris and writing what would become his memoir a movable feast he said he would push his little mr bumble i think he called him this little kid in a baby carriage through the water bologna and in the city and he'd grab a pigeon ring its neck and stick it in the baby carriage under the blanket next to his kid go home and cook it at least that's what he said he did but apparently did it a lot you do you right,3

Sign up here https://cen.yt/mbadamragusea7 for your free daily newsletter — I’ve really enjoyed Morning Brew and I think you will too!...,2022-12-01 14:47:05.183328, so i was playing around with my buttermilk biscuits technique trying to make it more efficient and get better layering and i stumbled onto this funny variation i'm calling fall over biscuits first thing is get the oven real hot 450 fahrenheit or 475 is what i'm doing almost 250c we need high heat to generate steam for puffiness super simple dough start with a cup of all-purpose flour 120 grams into a bowl that should feel a little too big for the job that will make cutting the butter in a lot easier later a teaspoon of sugar just makes the flavor taste a little more alive and helps with browning if i'm using unsalted butter half a teaspoon of morton kosher is a good amount of salt for me with salted butter i would just add a tiny pinch baking powder i do like a heaped teaspoon on that butter better butter tastes better in biscuits because there's lots of it proportionally two ounces have a stick almost 60 grams very cold right out of the fridge that's important i don't know why i slept on pastry cutters for so long these things cost like six bucks it's as fast as the food processor if you include setup it's tiny and it's way easier to clean you could use a knife to chop the butter into the flour instead or press a fork into it but this just does the best job and it does it quickly which is important because if the butter melts you end up with a tough homogeneous mixture that will not be as flaky or crumbly i think you want to cut the butter into chunks that are little but still clearly visible lots of butter in this recipe for the non-us crowd american biscuits are like scones but they're softer and richer and flakier at this point it's virtually a pie crust recipe but now we add a lot of moisture u.s style buttermilk fermented milk if you can't get this i would mix yogurt with milk or water until you get viscosity like that measure out half a cup 120 mls and then i'm pouring in most of it but keeping just a little bit behind for later mix that with a spoon as much as the spoon can do the dough should feel pretty wet the moisture will give us the steam we need for a lift time to flour my hand a little scrape off what's left on the spoon and knead that just barely just until it comes together into a ball no more too much kneading and it'll be tough throw that on a cutting board a big dusting of flour everywhere and then flatten it out into about half an inch or a centimeter i used to use a rolling pin for this but lately i've just been using my hands the hands seem to do just as good a job and they actually give you more control i want to shape this into as close to a rectangle as i reasonably can and then the first fold i gotta be sure to count same deal again smash it down to half an inch trying to keep it as rectangular as possible i'm flipping it there to make sure that the side i'm about to fold over on itself is well flowered the dry flower between the layers is what gives you nice clear distinct layers in the final product nice tidy rectangle top is well flowered fold over that's three folds keep going the more we can keep this rectangular the less trimming waste we'll have at the end i'm going for zero waste because i'm only making enough for four small biscuits here biscuits are only really good when they're very fresh so i see no point in making more than you can eat at a time just make as many as you and yours want with your morning brew that day

are usually shorter a stock summary with a few lines explaining the numbers then quick bullet point summaries of important stories that are helpful for me to skim before i start my day the writing is easily skimmed it's funny and it's interesting if you're into business finance and tech there's no reason to not subscribe to morningbrew it's free and takes two seconds to sign up for do us both a favor and sign up via my link in the description thank you morning brew we are approaching the magic number of folds which is seven i am hardly the first person to observe that seven is perfect you could do six but i would not do eight because the number of layers doubles with each fold the difference between seven and eight folds is really big and with eight folds the layers are so numerous and thin that they cease to be perceivable as layers seven folds is the upper limit with this kind of dough and for the seventh and final fold i'm going to dip into that little bit of buttermilk i have left and paint that onto the surface because we don't mash this down very hard after the final fold that middle seam has a tendency to not seal the biscuit just splits in two as it puffs in the oven the buttermilk will serve as glue and then we don't smash that out very much it should be an inch or a couple of centimeters tall nice tidy rectangle back in the bowl and in the freezer to chill for like 10 minutes if you chill the dough it is so much easier to cut and you get much cleaner layers you could use the traditional circular biscuit cutter but that gets you a lot of trimming waste squares are much more efficient and you can trim off a little on the sides if you want really clean edges that all show the layers but i don't care that much i am however going to cut this into triangles rather than squares i like triangles because they give you dry corners that contrast with the moist interior and the narrowness of the triangle shape is essential to the fall over effect i'm going to show you a sawing motion with my knife gets me cleaner cuts chill your dough gently saw it and look the layers are visible we've not smashed them into each other and blurred the lines and you could bake them just like that or you could brush the tops with melted butter or you could glaze the tops with that bit of buttermilk you have left this gets you a kind of shiny effect in those go to the very hot oven i'm not using my convection fan i find the fan gets the edges too brown before the inside can puff up all the way let them puff let them puff then five minutes in there it goes too tall and narrow to stay upright when this first happened to me i regarded it as a mistake but no longer you'll see why these took just 15 minutes total you don't want to get the edges too brown any browner than that on biscuits tastes burned if anything i baked these a hair too long so there's the top facing side nice clear laminations pale gold color flip it around to the side it toppled over on and over here you got deep golden croissant-like effect fall over biscuits two tastes in one the fact that they tumble a third of the way through baking ensures the brown sides won't get too hot and burn love it look the biscuits literally say it's not a shape that's good for splitting and making a biscuit sandwich with do squares for that but the way i like to eat biscuits is just pull them apart along their layers and summon forth the upside down bear good morning sir thank you for donating your delicious brains to my biscuits,3
How people first boiled food,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mBxRFw9W_xs/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLDOO1eD6IN2yFvd2WBx46BbCDiATg,mBxRFw9W_xs,"13 minutes, 23 seconds","Thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this video!

squarespace in the beginning there was no soup no stew no braising no blanching no poaching no frying even when the human ancestor homo erectus first started cooking their food somewhere in the hundreds of thousands of years ago it was almost certainly by just jamming it straight into the fire at the end of a stick roasting is where cooking all began dry heating methods and then somewhere in the tens of thousands of years ago came the epiphany stone soup nah it's called a pot boiler hot rocks dropped into some kind of water safe containment this is at least one of the ways that people simmered food for many thousands of years until they got cooking vessels that were both water and fire safe we're gonna recreate both of these cooking inventions in here to be clear nobody really knows how the first soup or stew was cooked the methods used for that kind of cooking rot really quickly and therefore they don't leave much archaeological record so a lot of this is speculation on the part of scholars who have thought about this for a long time in 2015 the anthropologist john speth shook up the thinking on this topic quite a lot he argued that stu or super such might be much older than previously thought he simply observed empirically that you can take a flammable material like an animal hide you can fill it with wet stuff to cook hold it directly over a fire and it won't burn the water that it's soaked in won't let it burn even if it's flammable certainly my little bit of animal hide was in no danger of burning in part because the water that it was soaked in dropped down onto the fire beneath it and put the fire out but maybe ancient people could have figured out a way to do this with something more waterproof and less drippy maybe an animal stomach maybe a woven basket lined with clay something like that there is archaeological evidence that neanderthals ate wet cooked food this is a grain of barley recovered from the back teeth of a neanderthal in modern day iraq and the scientists here conclude it appears to have been boiled the person who ate this lived maybe 50 000 years ago which is well before we have the first archaeological indication of anyone doing this arguably more advanced method of wet cooking i just dug a little hole in the dirt then i lined it with a really big leaf a banana leaf from my indian grocery drop some water into that and check it out that's holding water no leaking at all now over here my little fire i'm gonna drop some stones smooth river cobbles were historically a popular choice for this less likely to chip off little shards into your food then you just drop in some grains or whatever food you're trying to boil grab a couple of sticks and very carefully lift a hot stone into your little basin not exactly a rolling boil we're going to need some more stones and i suppose it'd be helpful to have a second person who could get down and blow the ash off the rock before you drop it in but hey there's some actual boiling there when stones are repeatedly heated up and then rapidly cooled down like that they gradually start to exhibit a characteristic pattern of cracking and glazing that is known as wait for it crazing that's actually where we get the words crazy and crazed he's all cracked up crazed river cobbles first entered the archaeological record about 30 000 years ago the upper paleolithic period nobody knows for sure if those stones were used as pot boilers they may have simply been used as hearthstones but at some point pot boilers definitely became a thing this is a method of cooking that persisted well into the era of written history some people still do it today and i can tell you from experience that it works surprisingly well your water is safely away from your fire so there's no risk of putting your fire out and with just a hole in a leaf i was able to get perfectly soft cooked grains in about an hour might seem like a lot of work but compared to what i didn't have to grind those grains down into flour using primitive stone tools and then bake them into bread and any sand or little pebbles or anything mixed in with migraine as a result of you know really kind of primitive processing methods well it just sinks to the bottom of the water and you just don't have to reach in there and eat it you just eat what floats to the top i kind of feel like i'm going to get cancer from eating all that ash but hey you only need to live like 14 years in order to reproduce successfully so it's all good but seriously wet cooking was such an advance for humanity you're able to extract so much more nutrients from the food because nothing is dripping onto the fire and being wasted it's all preserved in that broth that you can drink and you can soften really really tough foods down into a form that you can chew and digest you can simply feed more people with soup soup is good food and here's another benefit of stone boiling scientists believe this may be the way that ancient americans invented nixtamalization the process by which you soak corn in an alkaline solution to remove that waxy hull around the corn and to make harmony grits and tortillas and such nyxtamalization also renders certain amino acids in the corn more bioavailable to us if your diet is based almost solely on corn and you don't nixtamalize it you eventually get this terrible nutritional deficiency disease called pellegra so nyx stimulation is really important but i've always wondered how did people first get the idea to treat their food in a caustic alkali turns out it might have happened accidentally when they boiled their corn with limestone pot boilers in 2011 these scientists went to utah and did an experiment where they boiled corn using the same cedar mesa limestone that ancient people there would have used and the resulting boil water was a strong enough base to nixtamalize the corn their experiment doesn't prove it happened that way but it does prove it could have happened that way that said stone boiling in a leaf or an animal skin or something has its obvious disadvantages there's a reason that we all cook in pots today much easier to just throw a pot directly onto the fire so let's try to recreate the first cooking pot i've been digging the first level of this terraced vegetable garden into the hill behind my new house and when i got through a few inches of turf and topsoil i hit red clay hardly surprising this hill like most of the land around knoxville eventually slopes down to the tennessee river and clay is super common in river basins one of the ways clays form is through the chemical weathering of exposed rock rain is slightly acidic because of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere carbonic acid in the rain water lands on the rocks and it dissolves them a little bit all those dissolved minerals flow down into river and lake basins and they flow into deposits that today we call clay technically this might not be clay it's probably loam clay mixed with silt and sand which are little bits of minerals with significantly larger grain sizes if i want to make really nice clay i would dig up that loam fully dissolve it in lots of water and then filter out all of the sand and silt grains that are too big to qualify as true clay but i wanted to do it the way like the first person did it you got to figure that first person was just digging a hole for some other reason maybe to line with leaves and drop in hot rocks [Applause] are you mario in the pipe yes and then if we just keep ourselves in the mindset of this first person we notice that that clay-rich dirt down there is smooth and plastic it's moldable and the wetter pieces are more moldable so you figure if i add water to this i can start molding it into something you really have to bash it and work it to get the water distributed through modern potters call this wedging the clay and it has many benefits including working out air bubbles that might cause the piece to crack later you can also get out any big rocks and such that you come across as you work the water in once the clay is wedged it's smooth and plastic you just play with it and you figure hey i could use a thing for holding other things and there you go that was way easier than carving a bowl out of rock or even wood you let it dry in the sun for a day and it's nice and hard now but how do i get it off the rock that it's sitting on a modern potter might use a length of metal wire you just kind of shimmy it underneath the bottom of the piece to kind of cut it off of the surface that it's stuck to but the first person doing this didn't have metal wire so let's think of something else let's just bash that up and start from scratch we have at this stage is basically mud brick which is a surprisingly strong material it was a lot of work for me to get that dissolved into workable clay again the thing that eventually worked was bashing it with a rock you can see why people were able to get so far in life only using stone tools you might say they were living in a whole age of stone i'll trademark that later anyway there's my second draft pot and this time let's dry it on some leaves yeah that'll keep it from sticking to anything and after like a week of drying this is rock hard i'm quite sure that somebody then tried to cook in this and it might have worked the problem is even very dry clay will dissolve in water so you would get kind of a muddy broth and then eventually the clay the pot would just kind of melt away unless you got it so hot in your cooking fire that you fired it that's what potters do right they fire their clay in a kiln extreme high heat changes the chemical structure of the clay into an actual ceramic that is hard and won't dissolve in water it seems kind of likely to me that people maybe first did that accidentally by using a fire to accelerate the drying of the piece that maybe is what they were thinking they were doing or maybe they actually tried to cook in the dried piece the water boiled out the piece stayed in the fire and it got hot enough to actually fire turn into a ceramic to more reliably fire our pots we're going to need the first kiln which would have been a pit how convenient we already have a pit where we just dug out our clay get a fire going in the pit and then in goes the dried pot which i have preheated by letting it sit by the fire if it heats up too fast it'll surely crack then you just keep feeding that fire letting glowing hot coals crumple down onto the pot eventually fully encasing it it is insane the heat coming off of that hole even with no air to feed the fire from below then you just leave it walk away and here we are about 24 hours later and the coals are still very hot and the pot is way too hot to touch two days later and out it comes and yep there's a big old crack up one side pottery is hard but if we just use the other side we should be able to boil some food this time we can boil it directly on the fire instead of shuttling around hot rocks scientists used to think pottery like this was first invented five or ten thousand years ago and maybe it was in much of the world but in 2012 scientists announced they had found pottery fragments in a cave in china from 20 000 years ago by far the oldest find of any real ceramic they don't know for sure if these were cooking pots but they did seem to have been used in a fire clay pots would have been people's main type of cooking for a long time well past the stone age into the bronze and iron ages and into the early modern period no doubt metal is better it is much more thermally conductive and you don't have to worry as much about it cracking from thermal stress but until relatively recently metal was extremely expensive far too expensive for a normal family's cooking pot this ceramic pot was a simple effective ubiquitous solution to meet a universal need much like squarespace clay is all around you and squarespace is all around you there's a reason that so many people who need a website of some kind choose to build and run it with squarespace it's as easy as digging six inches in your backyard you pick a template suited to your purpose you throw in your own photos and your text and then you just drop in whatever additional features you need like talk check this out talk is the new all-in-one reservation system from squarespace it's for restaurant and hospitality type businesses anybody who needs to take reservations or sell tickets online the pricing for you is flat so you're not penalized for getting lots of business you own the data that you get on your customers who use it it's really worth checking out starting a squarespace site is always free but when you're ready to pay to take it live or some such use my code regucia at checkout you're gonna save 10 thank you squarespace and thank you pottery you were great for many thousands of years that said i'm totally going

***RECIPE, SERVE 4-6***...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.183328, here's a dish inspired by chicken rice the national dish of singapore with chinese roots chicken rice is poached chicken served with rice that you cook in the resulting poaching liquid i like the concept but i'm not wild about plain poached chicken i don't like that slimy skin i want crispy skin or a coating of some kind or both which is what i'm doing here first step is poach a whole chicken i don't think i'm doing anything different or weird here three and a half pound bird goes in a big pot a kilo and a half it could feed as many as six people with the rice a little bit of ginger to flavor the broth it's going to get strained out later so no need to peel a few sticks of lemongrass i love that stuff you could use some lime zest instead about twice as much salt as i'd normally use to season a bird this size i need enough salt for the chicken and the broth and then just cover that bird in water and while i'm here i'll put in a probe thermometer to the deepest part of the breast i'll lid that up and turn the heat on high at first just to get things going but i don't want to see it bubbling any more than that which is to say hardly bubbling at all so when it looks like that i'm going to lower my heat to where i can maintain that poaching is just like sous-vide the water doesn't need to be any hotter than the final internal temperature you desire on the meat you just let the chicken slowly come to equilibrium with the water and it will be cooked at perfect uniform doneness throughout as you can hear i've been sick so that smell is very comforting while we wait sliced cucumbers i've been loving the mini ones lately but you could just use one big one chicken rice is usually served with an array of garnishes one being some raw or maybe blanched cucumber plain cucumber since this is just home cooking i don't want to have to make a whole bunch of garnishes i just want to make one garnish so i'm going to have the cucumbers but i'm going to put them with some kind of onion a shallot in this case i thought i had a fresh chili to dice up and put in here but i couldn't find it in the fridge and then i'm going to do just a quick pickle on those a whole bottle of rice vinegar in there it's not a waste i'm going to reuse that later for my sauce and a big handful of sugar it doesn't matter if it doesn't dissolve at first it will in the fridge since i sliced that stuff thin it'll taste pickled by the time the chicken is cooked which should take an hour and most plenty of time to scan my grocery

that's a limited time offer for you thank you fetch so this chicken believe it or not is done yes that's just 150 fahrenheit in the breast 65c but pasteurization is a function of temperature and time 165 fahrenheit is the temp at which all the germs die instantly if you hold them at a lower temperature for a while it does the same thing there's meat pasteurization charts you can find online i held this at 150 for at least 10 minutes which is very easy to do with poaching because the liquid outside is basically the same temp as the meat inside that's why slow pasteurization works so well with a poaching or sous-vide it's way harder to hold a constant temperature when you're roasting at 400 or something for traditional chicken rice i think you generally plunge this into ice water that gets you a firm jelly-like texture on the skin i am among the many westerners who has trouble with that very popular texture in eastern food so i'm not doing it i'll just let that cool while i bring my broth to a full boil i want to reduce that concentrate that flavor as much as i can before i cook my rice in it when the chicken is cool enough to handle i'll break it down into portions i usually start by cutting the skin between the legs and the body and then i just reach in and dislocate the hip joints now i can just put my knife in where that joint used to connect cut down and there's the leg and thigh quarter don't be freaked out by the pink it's been pasteurized it's safe plus i'm going to cook this a second time in the oven so i wouldn't want it to be fully done at this stage anyway really easy to separate the leg and the thigh and for the wings i like to dislocate that joint again mainly just so i can see where i should cut i want bone-in breast pieces today so i'm going to shave off the backbone i'm cutting through the rib bones there which is easy to do when it's cooked hey you know what we should do with that backbone we get a lot of flavor out of that before that broth is done reducing now i'm going to split the breast down the middle through the breast bone might take a little force and then i usually like to cut each side of the breast in half as well right through the bones that just gets you a portion size closer to the legs and the thighs i swear this chicken will look appetizing before we're done here keep faith i'm planning to make two cups of dry long grain rice so i'll need about three cups of liquid to cook it in ideally i want to reduce this to three cups though you could always add water if you reduce it too far strain that out and hey nailed it legit i actually nailed that now you could finish this dinner right now or you could throw all this in the fridge and do the rest another time half an hour before you want to eat start the rice that's just two cups about 400 grams at most of long grain and i'm washing it because i'm going for the traditional east asian fluffy rice vibe just rinse and pour a few times to remove the powdery free starch coat i'll peel and finely chop some garlic and ginger pretty common to put aromatics in the rice for chicken rice and if i had a lot of rendered fat from my chicken i would cook these in the chicken fat but i just didn't get much so i'm going to use toasted sesame oil instead once those are just starting to go golden i'll pour in my rice and toast it they're dry for a minute same way the italians do for risotto this is totally a thing with chicken rice 2 often done in the chicken's own rendered fat in goes my broth it's chunky because it's chilled totally fine that any fat goes in there as well i'll stir that up cover and bring to a boil then reduce my heat all the way down to low just let it steam covered the rest of the way here's my pickles and i'm gonna boil that sweet pickle juice down to a glaze try to be more careful than me and don't let any onions go overboard they can burn at the temperature which will be boiling the glaze in goes a lot of soy sauce maybe one part soy sauce to two parts pickle juice then i'm gonna just bring this to a boil and reduce devotees might notice this recipe is similar to the reverse braised beef recipe that i posted recently indeed when i was cooking that it occurred to me that the same techniques might be applied to chicken rice which is a dish that i've wanted to find my own way of doing for a while so here we are when bubbles start to stack on themselves like that that's a good indication that you've reduced any sweet liquid into a syrup it won't seem very syrupy yet but that's because it's hot it'll thicken a ton as it cools and if you want even more syrupy or if you just want to have more glaze you could always summon forth the upside down bear and stir in a little honey can't hurt maybe more vinegar to balance it just taste and adjust okay chicken onto a sheet pan it won't look bloody much longer i'll give that a good splash of oil make sure the pan and all the pieces are coated and the pieces are positioned skin side up i want to crisp those skins under my broiler it should just take a few minutes by the time the skins are crispy to the touch the meat inside should be perfectly reheated and then i'm going to toss those pieces straight into my glaze this is why i didn't season those pieces before they went under the grill that glaze is salty with the soy sauce here's that fragrant chickeny rice pile that on it's really the main event a couple of contrasting chicken pieces and then a big handful of the drained pickles any excess glaze you have you can spoon over the top i was not ready for how perfectly cooked that chicken turned out super juicy inside without having any of that gelatinous texture that pink chicken can have and brown skin on top poached then broiled it's really the best of all worlds basically sous-vide but all you need is a pot yeah what am i thinking trying to eat a chicken leg with a fork let's just do this thing,3

has to be removed from the tip of the grass that it's growing on and then it has to be popped out of its tiny individual wrapping all 50 000 seeds are encased in what's called a hull or a husk and each tiny one has to be unwrapped before anybody can eat it when you consider the scale of the challenge it's hard to understand how most people for the last 10 000 years or so have survived primarily on grains and yet when you process grains yourself by hand you can see you can come to understand how it was possible i mean it's a lot of back-breaking work and a lot can go wrong but it is possible i'm quite happy to pay farmers to do this for me with modern combines and such but if you're curious about how this was done the old-fashioned way come with me first step of course is to get the wheat out of the field and you have to wait for just the right moment when the grains have grown to their maximum size and nutrition content and when the plants have started to dry down really when it's dried down most of the way if the wheat isn't dry if it's still a little green the only way to get the seeds out is literally one at a time with your fingers that's not gonna scale as the business school bros say so you have to let the plant complete its whole life cycle and literally die in the field oh beautiful for spacious skies for amber waves of grain you know i'm not exactly the target market for patriotic songs but i always liked that one especially the amber waves part and now i finally understand it to invoke the image of ambergrain is not the same thing as invoking the image of like green trees a field of grain is green most of its life it only dries and goes amber in the last few weeks before harvest so to invoke the image of ambergrain is to invoke the abundance of the harvest the song isn't just saying wow we grow a lot of grain in america the song is saying we have a lot of grain that is ripe and ready to be plucked like an apple if only it were so easy farmers traditionally would pull out a single grain and crush it with their thumbnail to assess its ripeness this is i think the late milk stage when the starchy endosperm is still a little liquid here is what i think is the soft dough stage where the starch is going powdery that's almost dry enough if you leave it drying in the field for too long the heads will shatter that is a stiff wind will come by and just blow the seeds off the plant and onto the ground that is of course the goal from the plant's perspective its goal is to protect its seed from animals and from the elements until the seed is fully grown and then it is to drop those seeds into the wind where they can go off and then grow into the next generation that's what the plant is trying to do a farmer has to wait for just the right moment when the plant is about to shatter but it hasn't quite shattered yet and over thousands of years farmers crossbred and selected for varieties that dried out but resisted shattering for at least a few weeks giving you some kind of window in which to gather up a massive labor force wait for the right weather go out there and reap the harvest still there was and is a lot of urgency to the harvest it has to be done at just the right time and done really quickly here's one for you brits in the year 1066 the last anglo-saxon king of england harold godwinson knew that william of normandy was planning an invasion harold gathered an army and a fleet of ships and he hung out on the south coast waiting all summer for william to cross the channel and attack william never came but september did and harold had to let most of his men go they needed to get back to their farms to gather in the harvest of summer wheat before it shattered right there in the fields fell onto the ground and germinated if that had happened they would have had a great head start on the winter wheat planting but they would have had nothing to eat in the meantime what's the point of winning the war if you're all going to starve with harold's fleet disbanded and his army elsewhere william was able to cross the channel establish a beachhead at pevensey and the rest is uh history which you could learn about

suppose it would have been noisy as the harvest was an all hands on deck affair you need a huge crew out there with sickles a sickle of course is this curved blade and you kind of swipe at the base of the straw and the sickle gathers up the straw into a nice tidy little bunch before it then cuts them off at the base and then with the other hand you grab that little bunch and there you go you have a nice tidy what's called a shock of wheat when the soviets were choosing a farm implement to represent the rural peasantry in their alliance with the industrial proletariat the sickle was the perfect choice way better than something like a plow as we discussed previously in the part 1 video that is linked in the description planting wheat is actually not that much work if i'm a landowner i can plant my own grain field myself or maybe with my sons or with a small group of hired hands once it's time to harvest the wheat however you need a giant crew of people to get down on their hands and knees with scythes this is one reason why it behooved landowners to maintain a perpetual landless underclass who would show up and do the job at exactly the right time the sickle is the tool of those poor bastards no wonder they eventually stood up and reaped the bourgeoisie's heads instead i could not use a sickle though myself because my wheat had lodged or fallen over we talked about this last time how important it was that in the 20th century people invented these modern semi-dwarf wheat varieties that will not fall over if the wheat is lodged in a tangled mass on the ground really the only way to get it up is to reach down with a knife or clippers or something and cut a few stems at a time then you gotta straighten them out and then stack them up into neat little shocks pretty much one at a time it took me half a day to get my little stand harvested and boy did my back hurt at the end oh hey check it out oats i planted the only wheat i could find which was just a bag of animal feed wheat and it was clearly a mash of all kinds of random things including oats oats have these kind of elegant dangly heads and the seeds inside are super long and pointy before they are steamed and rolled flat into instant oatmeal time now to thresh the wheat that is to knock the seeds off of the straw to shatter those heads one precision method that i've seen for this is to put your shock head first into some kind of sack i'm using a pillow case then you bash the heads like they owe your boss money you like to play the ponies huh then theoretically you can just pull out the bunch of decapitated straw and your shattered wheat is contained in the sack i got hardly anything by using this method and i got the feeling i was going to expend more calories than i created the problem was that it wasn't dry enough i needed to dry or cure my wheat until it was brittle enough that those heads would just break apart much more easily farmers traditionally did this out in the fields in rows of cut straw called windrows or maybe in stacks of shocks with their heads up where they won't get wet and start germinating in the ground i just laid my crop out on my front walkway and let them dry in the brutal southern sun which it did this also had the advantage of killing or driving away the thousands and thousands of aphids and other bugs who had infested my wheats they were all gone after a week of drying and my wheat seemed like it would shatter much more easily but i decided against the pillowcase method because i didn't want my neighbors to call the cops on me and also because i wanted to do it the way that most ancient people would have done it the way that you can scale up into proto-mass production to feed a whole village let's call it the kill em all and let god sort em out method you just bash up the wheat on a piece of flat ground known as a threshing floor you smash it you step on it you throw it around whatever just cause as much destruction as you can right down there on the ground the most effective technique that i found was to grind everything against the ground with my hands though i got a lot of splinters in my hands doing that because each grain is connected to a long hair-like thing called an on that is the wheat's beard if you look really closely those hairs are like serrated knives these are supposed to help the seed kind of hook itself into the ground and get established but i still have a lot of these little guys embedded in my skin you can see why people invented all kinds of tools for just smashing the wheat on the threshing floor and once you have completely pulverized it you sweep it up with a broom and where historically speaking would you have gotten a broom the seeds are way heavier smoother and smaller so they sink to the bottom of that pile as you sweep you can just lift the straw up off the top and stack it and right there you can see why grain agriculture historically went hand in glove with animal agriculture most of what we've created here is cellulose a carbohydrate that humans can't digest but some animals can feed the straw to them and if you're like me you've always wondered about these words straw is the stemi byproduct of grain cultivation hay is a similar thing but it's not a byproduct hay is a crop you grow just so you can cut it down let it dry and roll it up and feed it to the animals seeds and all speaking of nomenclature let's resume our list from the last video where we are counting up common words or phrases that have their origin in the cultivation of grains because it is time to winnow our wheat winnow it down we got to remove all of the stuff in here that is not stuff we want to eat most notably the hull that's what these little parchments are there the husk the hull it's just indigestible cellulose and with ripe modern bread wheat varieties the hall just falls off during the threshing phase that was not always the case dr catherine zabinsky of montana state university writes about this in her book amber waves the extraordinary biography of wheat the earliest wheats that were used emma and eincorn they had one more thick protective layer that you would first have to use something like a mortar and pestle and pound it off or you know you could soak them and you could char them over a fire and then they would more easily pound off and then what you would have left is that hard seed so one of the reasons that bread wheat and durum really took off was that hard layer the hull it's still present but they're really fragile like it's just uh easily dropped for you don't have to think too much about it you do have to think about how you get it out of your pile but this part is surprisingly easy traditionally you would wait for a windy day then you would just throw the wheat into the air i didn't have time to wait for that so i got out my box fan and dropped the wheat in front of it the heavy aerodynamic seeds fall straight down while the papery hulls and tiny bits of straw just blow away it's really pretty remarkable you have to do it several times but very gradually you separate the wheat from the chaff that chaff is also considered high-grade animal feed and there's also probably a lot of stray seeds just hanging out there on the threshing floor rather than let them go to waste you could bring your chickens over and let them glean the threshing floor let them eat whatever you can't eat so that you can then eat them works i still have lots of big pieces of straw and maybe some rocks and stuff in there so i needed to winnow this down further a pizza screen was the perfect filter for getting out anything bigger than a kernel of wheat and then i used a sieve a fine screen to get out anything smaller than a kernel look at all that sand from the threshing floor yikes my yield from a 50 square foot stand of wheat was almost four pounds of whole grain wheat which is not bad though keep in mind you have to set a lot of that aside for planting the next crop the easiest way to eat all of those grains would be to boil them into a porridge but you got to remember that humans started eating grains long before they invented water and fire safe vessels in which to cook food cook wet food so really their only option was to grind it down into a digestible powder flower historically this was an incredibly laborious process involving stone tools that i was not up for so blender you can't get as fine a grain with a blender as you get with real milling tools but that's not bad coarse ground whole wheat flour the original flour for the original bread as i was kneading it i could tell that i had very little gluten in there the proteins that make doughs and bread stretchy and elastic this means i might have gotten some soft wheat in my feed bag as opposed to hard wheat high protein wheat for bread making it may also mean that much of what was in that bag was actually barley a grain that is virtually identical to wheat but has a lot less gluten anyway this loaf was pretty crumbly not very fluffy or chewy and speaking of texture it was full of sand from my front walkway edible but pretty disgusting historically how did people winnow out all of the sand and dirt from their threshing floor they didn't their teeth were terrible they had packed teeth all the time and think about this if you actually instead of putting it in your blender which doesn't fall apart when you use it you had one rock that you used to grind your seeds on top of another rock they had you know little rock fragments mixed in with their wheat all the time so you know really a good indication of a ancient people eating wheat is their teeth are terrible with you know a little mix out of them everywhere personally i'd much rather boil my grains into a soup or a porridge but that would have to wait for the invention of pottery which is an incredibly momentous event in the history of food that we'll talk about another day,3

To make a milkshake:...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.183328, that's a shade that's milk and ice cream you know if you were smart as you thought you were vincent you wouldn't have got got i'm here to argue there's three essential ingredients to a good milkshake milk ice cream and syrup or something else that functions like a syrup the syrup helps a ton texturally as well as tastually it could just be simple syrup equal parts granulated sugar and water by weight or volume their ballpark same density bring to a boil keep it there a minute max pour it off let it cool milkshakes come out way better when everything is cold all your ingredients and your tools i'll show you the best vessel i've found for blending milkshakes in at home a big mason jar one quart about a liter chilled in the freezer and i'd pull the ice cream out at the last second i'm using sweet cream ice cream which is just plain no vanilla no nothing it gives me a blank canvas it's from this beloved local dairy here in knoxville tennessee look at that natural caramel color just from the milk fat and the eggs i'm scooping in half the pint that's two to fifty mils and instead of plain milk i'm reaching for evaporated milk i love this stuff i use it all the time in a shake it does the exact same thing as regular milk plus a spoon of milk powder which is a trick that a lot of people use it just makes a stronger milk flavor and a smoother texture from the casein protein really just a quarter cup to start with 60 mls or something big lug of vanilla since there's none in the ice cream the expensive stuff does usually taste better and then like a spoon or two of simple syrup without the syrup a milkshake is either under sweet or over thick depending on the milk content and hey just for fun let's do it i'll go butterfingers let's do an oreo maybe two now you could blend this in any big narrow thing the mason jar is just the best thing in my house as long as i've chilled it glass is pretty thermally conductive it'll melt your ice cream if it's not cold same as metal and i love doing this with a stick blender instead of a countertop style blender the immersion blender is smaller it's cheaper it's easier to clean it gives you more control you can reach into corners where the ice cream isn't getting mixed and you can feel the texture with a little experience you can feel through the blender if you need more milk to get this into a drinkable texture there's no point in making a milkshake if you're gonna put it into a thermally conductive cup that is not chilled it'll melt in 30 seconds if the glass is not frosty but right now that's too thick to suck up with a straw which is how milkshakes usually are when i buy them out these days maybe restaurants do that because they think proportionally more ice cream equals more quality maybe it's because they think it's under sweet if you do too much milk but that's what the syrup fix is and i say there's no point in milkshakes if you can't drink them otherwise it's just ice cream served with the wrong utensil and you can easily add more milk or syrup or whatever it needs right there in the glass so be conservative up front and you can't lose maybe they put in too much ice cream because it's colder that way and that gives them more time to serve it before it melts but the frosty glass protects us just as the sponsor of this video protects us surf shark let me thank them hey that's me the little s up there is the frosty glass of the internet before you do anything on your computer or your phone just log in through one of

percent off thank you surf shark now right here is another key to a better milkshake experience at home a small cocktail glass high ball rocks glass old-fashioned glass this one is eight ounces to the brim these chill great because they're so thick and they're small which means you can fill it to the brim with a reasonable portion of milkshake two scoops of ice cream is perfect for that glass like a quarter of the pint splash of evaporated milk to start with and instead of making syrup you could summon forth the upside down bear it's a ready-made syrup and an underrated flavor pairing with ice cream also goes great with berries the last of the blackberries from my vine there's a lot of squirrels with purple paws running around here i see you not only is this big mason jar the perfect dimensions but that tapered lip at the top works as a splatter guard and because this is headed into a merely eight ounce glass we can fill it all the way to the top which looks a lot nicer to fill the pint glass all the way up you need almost a pint of ice cream restaurants use the whole pint that's why they give you the little bit of excess in the mixing vessel next to your glass i don't need to drink a whole pint of ice cream but i do need that dollop of real whipped cream just cold cream in a bowl whip until you get stiff-ish peaks a little vanilla and sugar delicious it's popular on milkshakes because it provides heterogeneity to an otherwise homogeneous dessert that tastes great but strongly of honey i don't want that honey taste every day so let's go back to syrup and simple syrup is a very easy way of extracting flavor out of other things like plant parts my new place has like endless beds of mint for some reason to use it in something but leaves and such you want to put in after the syrup has pretty much stopped bubbling if you stir them in when it's still really boiling the syrup will be brown and taste cooked not fresh as this will as soon as i strain that out and chill it i want a lot of mint flavor in there so that i don't have to add too much sweetness proportionately to my ice cream big splash of evaporated milk and nobody has to know if we sneak in a little green food coloring splash of vanilla really complements mint it softens it and chocolate chips now because i need them to get pulverized with everything else the chocolate bits have to be small enough to pass through a straw otherwise it's not a drink i just got this shake from a hipster burger place with chunks of cookie dough so big that they couldn't pass through the double wide straw they served it with that's not a drink this is a drink loose enough that i can sip it through a normal compostable straw how about a chocolate syrup instead the benefit of making it yourself is you can use much higher quality cocoa powder and you can put in way more of it this is equal parts sugar water and cocoa by volume i like to let the cocoa actually boil for a few seconds that deepens the flavor off the heat and this is a job for a tiny whisk it takes some stirring but it's amazing how much cocoa you can fit in there and when you chill it it has this amazing gooey ganache like texture you could frost a cake with that it's great in the milkshake or on it or both an alternative to making a flavored syrup is to sweeten your shake with a big spoonful of fruit preserve any kind this is marmalade for you brits couple of scoops of ice cream splash of evaporated milk buzz buzz buzz and well nobody has to know red plus yellow equals orange right hey this time let's plop some cream in the bottom of the glass shake on top and another dollop of cream in the top this has got an upscale creamsicle thing going on that i really like but this whole video people from the new england region of the united states have been screaming that's not a shake that's a frap a shake with syrup is a frap and it's our thing well here's something that should make you happy marshmallow fluff from summerville mass you want to make a new england deer cry make them a fluffernutter sandwich marshmallow cream and peanut butter on white bread they all grew up with it and we can use the fluff in place of syrup get in there you big spoonful of peanut butter too a couple of scoops of ice cream and we'll probably need a little extra milk to counteract the thickening power of those mix-ins can you make milkshakes without a power tool i don't think so you have to warm the ice cream too much to make it whiskable it's just a glass of melted ice cream at the end there's a reason the milkshake popularized when and where it did early 20th century us only the new electrical blenders could get you something so smooth and frosty and cold and i love how the cold here has made the little bits of marshmallow go firm they're small enough to go up your straw but they still chew a little like marshmallows and i guess a fluffernutter is supposed to have bread so mini nilla wafers that one might not look pretty but it's totally the one i'm gonna make again for myself when you're not looking,3

squarespace i'm pleased to report that i successfully grew bread from the ground i planted wheat in the fall grew it over the winter harvested it in late spring cured it threshed it winnowed it milled it and baked it it was a ton of work resulting in probably the worst loaf of bread i've ever had i can totally see why we went with the whole modern industrialized food system thing it has its advantages but this was a real fun thing for me to do nonetheless starting eight or ten thousand years ago i think it's safe to say most people on this planet would have spent at least some of their time participating in the growing and or processing of grain-based foods to do it yourself is to feel in your bones what it was like to be human up until very recently when these processes were mechanized in the developed world and people like me ceased to have any hand in them at all step one is plant some wheat seeds otherwise known as wheat the thing that we eat that's the same thing that we put in the ground to get more of it all grasses make seeds even your lawn grass if you don't mow it down wheat is just a group of grass species that produce giant versions of those seeds our hunter-gatherer ancestors just picked those seeds off of the wild plants this is a story told by dr catherine zabinsky an ecologist at montana state university and author of amber waves the extraordinary biography of wheat from wild grass to world mega crop they would likely have found um is just scattered bunches of grasses on a hillside growing with a mix of a bunch of other grass species maybe underneath oak trees when the grains are just ripening like that they're soft the carbs in there are kind of milky so you can pick the seeds right off the plant and eat it raw it doesn't really taste like anything maybe a little sweet dr zabinski is pretty sure that's where it all started people just eating kind of fresh soft grains right off of the plant but pretty soon people started to eat dried grains grains that either dried by themselves on the plant and maybe fell off you can collect them off the ground like that or grains that people dried themselves arguably the chief virtue of grain as a food source is that when it is dried it is preserved you can carry it with you you can eat it through the winter when there's less fresh food around we find grinding tools like you would use for grass seeds oh as long ago as 30 000 years ago before we find evidence of settlements so very likely you'd have tools like that in areas where there were stands of wheat and if you were nomadic and moving around to follow food sources you'd arrive at the wheat and rye and other wild grasses at those stands during the season where you knew you could gather ripe grass seeds suffice it to say these would have been pretty meager meals the seeds of ancient grass plants were a lot smaller than these and these are hardly the creme de la creme the only wheat i could find at a garden store was the stuff sold for animal feed not for planting so i have no idea what variety this is it's probably a grab bag hey there's some corn bonus i guess i tilled my soil just dug it up to loosen it so the seeds can sink down in there and i'm simply throwing them on the ground somewhat indiscriminately this is a planting technique known as broadcasting hey let's keep a running tally of common words or phrases that have their origins in the farming or processing of grains that's number one broadcasting this all started in what we now call the middle east it was about nine or ten thousand years ago when we've got the first evidence of people actually planting wheat seeds and growing a field of wheat you gotta admire the discipline it would have taken to do that as i was planting i just kept thinking this is food that i'm just throwing on the ground you got to figure that ancient people perpetually on the edge of starvation they would have had trouble thinking months ahead instead of just eating what they already had in their hands hence the expression don't eat your seed corn it means don't allow your immediate desires to ruin your future corn in english used to mean any kind of grain or more broadly any small hard thing though the grains started to get less small as humans began to farm them definitely by the time of the ancient greeks there was fairly early on a sense of ah we should save the big seeds because that will help us to get better wheat plants next year and more as late fall came and the weather got cold and rainy i noticed my wheat had sprouted that little white curlicue there that is the wheat sprout and as it grows you get what looks like blades of grass because that's exactly what they are this is what it looked like around christmas here in the southern u.s lawns in fancy neighborhoods will often be this kind of iridescent green in winter because people plant an annual crop of wheat or rye on top of their normal turf grass just so they can have a vibrant green lawn in the cold months look at this this is where my kids spilled the bag of feed seed on the lawn i didn't till that ground or anything and the wheat still took root did real good now you might be wondering why do people grow wheat in the winter why not grow it in the warm months when most other food is grown well you can and summer wheat is a thing there are varieties that grow well when you plant them in the spring and then harvest them in late summer into the fall but historically speaking winter wheat was the main event the main crop the original wild wheat was a winter wheat and that makes sense when you consider where wheat came from the middle east the plant would germinate in the fall and then you'd have a cool wet winter and not a lot happen but you'd have these you know short plants that's over wintered and then in the spring once things warmed up they were ready to grow and they could complete their life cycle pretty quickly which was important because the summers were really hot indeed when i first moved from the temperate northern us to the sweltering southern u.s i discovered that there are two winters down here there's the cold winter and there's the hot winter the dog days of summer when plants really struggle to grow and nobody really wants to be outside for very long it's just like winter but it's hot wheat comes from a place that has hot winter and as soon as the heat and the drought started who cares for wheat i mean we're done we've produced our seeds and now we're just gonna wait till the first fall rains when you've got you know the soils are a little cooler you've got some moisture and we're going to germinate again but winter wheat can also do great up north like montana where dr zabinsky is a snow blanket insulates the plant through the coldest months it was my birthday in march when i noticed the first ears on my wheat that's what those are called those little vertical stacks of seeds or rather i should call them fruits grains are technically fruits because they grow out of tiny little flowers it's interesting planting wheat is a little bit of work harvesting and processing wheat is a lot of work but in between the like half of the year in between those two acts you kind of don't really do anything you just guess make sure that animals don't trample it down or graze on it otherwise you just let it grow you can totally get a sense of why ancient people who successfully farmed grains also had time to build ziggurats and invent writing systems and new and interesting ways to kill each other for stupid reasons hence civilization with and without ironic air quotes everything with my little 50 square foot plot was going great until a big spring thunderstorm came and most of it fell over i thought that it might stand up again once the rain evaporated off but nope it just laid there in a tangled mess exacerbated by the fact that i think i planted my wheat a little too densely it's really bad when wheat falls over it doesn't get as much light down there to grow big plump grains and it's a lot harder to harvest as something that i'll show you and once down there like that it's way more susceptible to disease and infestation things that generally come from the ground and that like the shady damp conditions down there near the ground at first i thought that was dirt on the wheat there but then i looked real close and nope those are aphids little tiny bugs that suck the nutrient-rich sap out of tender plant parts ladybugs eat aphids that's why ladybugs are a farmer's friend but my aphids seem to be multiplying too fast for the ladybugs to keep up with why did this happen why did my beautiful wheat tumble over well this can happen for a few reasons but here's one of them if your variety of wheat is not adept at managing high nitrogen contents sometimes the stems can grow too tall and then they tip over which is called lodging lodging my wheat lodged perhaps because i overfed it i've worked really hard on that garden plot for many years building up the soil nutrients with chemicals and compost the original wild wheat rarely had dirt so good it's just like with us people modern abundance has made nutrients so available to us that it causes certain parts of us to grow more than is optimal for our bio functions same deal with the wheat the plant gets too much nitrogen and water and sunshine the stem grows too tall and it flops over before it can complete its reproductive cycle lodging wheat got to be a particular problem in the mid 20th century why because northern countries like the united states started to export their modern agricultural practices down to bright sunny southern countries like mexico this was all part of an incredibly momentous event in human history known as the green revolution the green revolution was actually designed to help fight what they call the red revolution or the spread of communism you gotta appease that proletariat before they rise up with the commies you gotta keep them well fed better fed than red and this is why american capitalism in the form of the rockefeller foundation sent a guy named norman borlaug to mexico it is often argued that norman borlaug is one of the most important people who most people have never heard of the first thing he did down in mexico was breed wheat that was resistant to a terrible fungal disease that they had down there called stem rust at that point he had these healthy plants and he was boosting them with modern fertilizer and modern irrigation techniques job done red menace abated right but once you do that especially in a climate that's fairly hospitable for plant growth like parts of mexico and georgia your plants grow really tall with the extra fertilizer and they'll lodge or tip over so borlaug crossbred his wheat with a dwarf variety from japan wheat with really short fat stems the result is the modern semi-dwarf disease-resistant wheat that doesn't fall over there's a lot of bad things you could say about the green revolution and they will say them another day but it is certainly true that norman borlaug's work saved the lives of millions and millions of people from famine and from resource wars he was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1970 and he died at home in texas in 2009 age 95. borlaug couldn't save my weak though again i actually have no idea what variety this is it's just feed wheat and it's not quite dry enough for harvest there but between the infestation and the fact that i sold that house in georgia to move up here to tennessee well i decided that it was time to reap what i had sown creating things from the earth that's hard creating things from squarespace

***RECIPE, SERVES SIX***

1 3 lb (1.36kg) beef chuck roast 
2 shallots
2 jalapeño...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.183328, i think i may have invented a new kind of food but also a new kind of stupid congratulations we'll get back to the stupid part what i wanted to try is brazing a tough cut of meat until buttery soft chilling it firm and then searing it the result is this weird hybrid of a stew and a steak dry crispy crust on the outside molten beef butter on the inside and i think it can be prepared safely if you learn from my mistakes with any braise a tough and very fatty cut is best but i think it's particularly true of this dish which is drier than a big wet stew so you need that intramuscular fat for texture this is shoulder a three pound chuck roast one of the least expensive cuts of even a very expensive cow the shoulders of pigs or sheep would work great too at almost a kilo and a half this could feed like six people but i'm cutting it up into only four chunks right now this is just for easy handling they'll break apart into even smaller chunks as we braise what's important is that you cut them into true steaks that is the meat fibers are running up and down instead of side to side this configuration gets you shorter meat fibers that will be less stringy in the final dish a coating of oil and i'm seasoning them very aggressively these are big chunks of meat plus they're gonna share this salt with the braising liquid that i'm gonna reduce into a glaze i'm salting the meat and the sauce right now i should have put even more salt on now you don't have to brown these first you could just put them straight into water and simmer them until tender because we're gonna sear them at the end i am also browning them just a little bit right now up front so i guess they're going to be double seared if you simmer unbrowned beef for several hours it kind of makes the whole house smell like those cans of wet dog food if i just create a little brown flavor now that smell will be much nicer and maybe it'll infuse some superior flavor into the beef but this is really optional you could just simmer them in salty water instead no oil needed if you don't brown them i'm intentionally not browning these very thoroughly a because it's not necessary and b because i don't want the surface to burn later when we sear them again this is also why i am brazing in plain water instead of my signature white wine wine has sugar and i don't want a lot of sugar in the surface of that meat when we sear it later it would burn get that bubbling reduce it to a simmer cover and cook it all damn day i might flip it around once or twice just to check on it make sure the liquid hasn't all evaporated i like the heat barely bubbling that gets you meat that is still pink on the inside at the end now we have plenty of time to think about what we're eating with this extremely rich meat i'm thinking something green instead of something starchy i had been a good boy for a while but in the chaos of moving to the new place i really fell off the wagon in terms of healthy eating and exercise hence noom the sponsor of this video let me thank them numb is a health program created by behavioral psychologists i've said a million times that a million ways of eating and exercising can be great for you the trick is tricking yourself into actually doing it i tell noom that i'm trying to be a little leaner and stronger they help me put numbers and dates on my goals and then they teach me the psychology of how such goals are achieved you can read or listen like podcasts feeling full on fewer calories for me this isn't really about learning nutrition it's about having a thing on my phone that's gonna keep pinging me making sure i'm doing what i know needs to be done see this beef dinner is going to be most of my calorie budget for the day to meet my goal that's fine i just need to keep it in mind and plan accordingly nume helps hit my link in the description to get started with a free health evaluation start your new program today with my link in the description thank you new now i'm gonna have this beef with some quick pickled vegetables i want rounds of shallot instead of strips so shallow cut across the outer layer peel it off and then slice right through you can do carrots all kinds of veggies i'm doing some jalapenos really nice thin rounds that'll pickle really fast i'm leaving the ribs in there because i want a little heat but you can take them out dump all that in a bowl and then just cover with any vinegar i'm using red wine vinegar today and it doesn't have to fully submerge everything now because the veggies are going to release a ton of their own liquid and because these are just quick refrigerator pickles i'm not actually trying to safely preserve these for long-term storage they'll last a week in the fridge and i want sweet pickle so i'm dumping in a handful of sugar that'll be distributed across a lot of portions you could bring this to a boil really quick people do that but i prefer the fresher texture you get by just covering these and throwing them in the fridge raw the sugar will dissolve in time as little as a half hour in there will make those veggies taste really good but longer is better so here's the meat after like five hours if i poke it i can see that it's just barely holding itself together which is how i want it i want meat jelly i'll pull these out very carefully with a slotted spoon to drain them i wish i had set them onto a paper towel at this stage to dry the bottoms even more that's the first stupid mistake i made that led to it's a pretty common east asian thing to cook a duck or something really soft in liquid and then chuck it in a deep fryer to crisp up that works great because soft things can survive in a huge volume of oil in contrast if we tried to sear these in just a film of oil right now they'd break apart they're too delicate for that so instead i'm going to reduce my braising liquid a little bit and then dump it into a jug i'll stop right before all those bits go in don't boil it down too much before you do this if it's too viscous the fat won't be able to separate out cleanly and i want to get it out all of my goals will be achieved if i just cover the liquid and the meat and throw it in the fridge for a few hours to firm up solid you could do all these steps the day before you want to eat or first thing the morning of here we are a few hours later and i have a solid fat puck that i can just lift out i was thinking i might sear the beef right in its own fat there so i figured i'd scrape the bottom off any water or meat bits sticking to the fat will spit a lot as the fat heats to searing temperature i did not scrape it nearly thoroughly enough that's stupid mistake number two that i made into a smaller pan i'll pour my defatted broth it's literally gelatinous because the connective tissue in that tough shoulder meat dissolved from collagen into gelatin as we braised that's why tough cuts are good for braising that's going to be lip smacking texture as we reduce this to a glaze a glaze generally needs some sweet and sour and hey we have both right here pour in a bunch of that sweet pickle juice bring to a boil and reduce hopefully yours reduces faster than mine my new kitchen has a gas stove top which i'm not used to and i'm having trouble getting enough power out of it but once it gets to about that thick you got to start stirring it just to keep the sugar from sticking to the bottom and burning if we hadn't taken the fat out of this there would be an oil slick on top right now glazes are terrible at holding fat inside themselves keep in mind this is going to thicken a lot as it cools so i think that's done another thing to do with that sweet pickle juice is make a vinaigrette for our side salad throw in some mustard for its emulsifying power and then as much olive oil as you want i usually like equal parts oil and vinegar which is pretty acidic but you know me give that a taste beautiful dressing finally time to sear the beef so i'll melt that fat down over highest heat and yikes all that moisture that was clinging to the puck of fat is now escaping as steam and exploding sending hot oil all over the pan is spitting as they say well i've never been afraid of a little cleanup after dinner so time to sear those cold beef chunks and their own fat okay well remember how i said i wish i'd dried the bottom of the pieces on a paper towel the moisture under there rapidly expanded and sent fat exploding everywhere on an electric stove like i'm used to that usually just makes a mess on a gas stove spinning oil is liable to ignite on the open flame and that's exactly what happened [Music] not my smartest moment so let's try this again in good old olive oil you need a thick coating because the meat is cold and rigid and not going to conform immediately to the pan surface the oil needs to come up to meet the meat where it is moderate heat is good here that reduces spitting and i don't want the crust to burn before the inside of the meat is at a chance to warm up remember it's cold at the same time i want to flip these while they're still firm enough to withstand the trauma when they have a beautiful golden crust on all sides and they feel soft in the middle again it's time to eat on goes some salad greens that i just tossed in our dressing some pickles the acidity of which will cut the richness of this meat if you top with glaze like i'm doing here you'll want to wait until the last second for guests i would serve it on the side in a little cup i went through a lot of extra work to make sure this has a dry steak-like crust on it and if it sits in that glaze for too long you'll lose that texture contrast i love the contrast of the super rich meat with the bright crisp salad and pickles my recipe in the description includes the steps that would prevent any pyrotechnics like you witnessed step one being don't be an idiot like me i'll get used to that gas stove one of these days i'm sure but hey it's a good reminder why we always have a fire extinguisher in the kitchen we all have stupid moments so we gotta be smart in advance

Dry processed coffee — tastes like Tropical Skittles?,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WZgrmIQh60s/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLD2joSzo3F1JpBkVM5L0Qo45jgorg,WZgrmIQh60s,"13 minutes, 23 seconds",Thanks to Morning Brew for sponsoring today’s video!

I’ve really enjoyed Morning Brew and I think you will too!...,2022-12-01 14:47:05.183328, so-called coffee beans are not actually beans they are in fact the seeds of a fruit and the particular method that you use to get the seeds out of the fruit well that has a really profound effect on how your coffee is going to taste getting the seeds out is known somewhat generically as processing and it's arguably as important to the taste of your coffee as roasting is most people who drink coffee know what kind of roast they like do you know what kind of processing you like do you like dry or wet processed coffee or maybe something in between i had no idea until i visited this coffee company north of atlanta it's called alma coffee and here i drank some really good dry or natural processed coffee and it immediately became my new favorite thing a beverage almost unrecognizable to me as coffee but incredible we're going to talk about these different ways of liberating the seed from the fruit talk about why dry processing kind of faded from popularity for a bit and why it has kind of come back now among coffee nerds it's a very similar story to the one you could tell about wheat for most of the history of cultivated grains a cleaner or purer more refined product was the goal but then we got arguably too good at it and some folks started wanting to turn the dial back to something more like this it's not the perfect comparison with coffee processing but i'll show you what i mean real quick you might remember that i visited this coffee company recently for a fully sponsored video that was about coffee roasting that's a good video it's linked in the description what you're watching right now this is not that this video has a different sponsor and no one who has anything to do with the coffee industry is paying me right now i'm telling you about this because i think it's super interesting let's go the fruits of coffee shrubs or trees are known as cherries for obvious reasons though if you were to bite into one you'd be real disappointed apparently the fruit itself can actually taste kind of nice there's just very little of it you got a waxy skin then a very thin layer of mesocarp which is the actual fruit part of a fruit then usually two of these proportionally massive seeds coffee cultivation began in east africa and or the arabian peninsula and legendary accounts of its discovery there involve people being very disappointed by the fruit they say they tried to eat the seed it was really hard it was really bitter they tried cooking it still super hard so as kind of a last resort they tried you know sort of brewing it making a soup out of it basically and it was still pretty bitter but it made them feel zippy no doubt people have tried all kinds of ways of getting the seeds out but in the hot and dry climate of arabia and east africa the easiest way to do it on a large scale was what we now call dry or natural processing alma does this at leticia hutchins family farm in honduras her husband harry is getting ready to roast some at the roastery at the coffee farm down in honduras finca territo the natural process is one in which we are taking the coffee off the tree and we're actually drying it in the coffee cherry skin you can actually see the discoloration the staining right there but it this coffee really smells of really ripe fruit kind of strawberries people call this natural probably because it mimics what would happen in nature if the fruit just kind of ripened on the tree fell off and then just sat there or at least this mimics what would then happen in a hot dry climate like east africa or arabia in a wet climate like honduras the fruit would just rot if you let it sit there at finca terrarito they lay the whole cherries onto a concrete patio for a day in the sun and then they move them to these raised beds where air can circulate all around the fruit over the next two or three months they watch them really carefully and move them around or turn them to make sure that molds and mildews and such are not growing on them and at the end this is what the coffee cherry looks like after it's dried out through some relatively simple milling you pop the seeds out of the desiccated skin and there you go dry processed coffee beans again you can see the lingering discoloration on their surface alma does a very light or low temperature roast on those beans because they want to taste the bean and not the roast remember that's what a light roast gets you they're setting up what's called a cupping an almost ritualistic process in the coffee industry where you just pour hot water onto naked coffee grounds in a cup you let them steep let them bloom you grab a heated spoon and push away the so-called crust floating at the top so that you can smell and then sip this is supposed to give you the purest experience of the coffee that's the natural process super funky it's very funky very floral that's an understatement i think that is the kind of brew i would like to enjoy with my morning brew the sponsor of this video let me thank them real quick morning brew is a free daily newsletter covering the

coffee taste like coffee that has been dried inside its whole intact fruit that tastes like a coffee juice cocktail even though the fruit has been removed totally just the residual flavor of it there on the bean has made it so fruity harry describes it as like tropical skittles which i think is inaccurate only in the sense that it isn't a very flattering comparison there isn't much actual like sugar sweetness in there nor is there actually much acidity surprisingly there's just a ton of this really really deep aroma of tropical fruits i tasted that and naturally i thought to myself why isn't all coffee like this why don't they dry all coffee right inside the fruit it tastes so good well i suppose in part it's because there's room in the world for lots of very different coffee you might not want the fruity aromas and heavy body of a dry processed coffee every day it's also the case that not all dry processed coffee is as good as that and historically it definitely wasn't as good as that lots of things can go wrong with the dry or natural process for example if you don't harvest your coffee cherries very carefully maybe you've got a lot of under ripe ones in there and you don't do a good job sorting them out those flavors are going to be really apparent in the coffee it's also the case that like if you dry the beans not up on fancy expensive drawing beds but like down on the ground you could get some rustic or earthy notes in there as well plus you could actually mess up and let them rot a little bit down there let them get a little bit of mold on them in which case some really off spoiled notes make it into the coffee or you have to throw away a big chunk of the coffee that you are drying down there because you notice it's going moldy so you've lost a lot of your crop plus the natural process just takes a long time all of this is why somebody dutch colonists it is often said somebody invented the wet process resulting in washed coffee beans wash coffee the most common coffee around the world and this is where we are taking everything off the cherry skin and leaving just the coffee parchment to then be dried most of alma's coffees are washed most fancy single origin coffees are washed washed coffee has historically been regarded as the superior product and a lot of people today still regard it as the superior product the specifics of course vary a lot but first you generally float the cherries in water to sort them unripe fruit or leaves and such are going to float the good fruit is going to sink very efficient and effective sorting system that is now dry processed coffees can also be sorted via this floating method and sometimes they are but you got to remember that historically the dry process originates from dry climates where they don't have spare water for doing this then in the wet process you pass the cherries through some kind of machine that strips off the outer part of the fruit the skin and some of the mesocarp and the meat of the fruit but a little bit of the meat is going to stick to the seed you can't just tear it off with the machine that meat is what we call the nectar of the mucilage and the way you get that sweet sticky outer layer off is you put the beans in a big wet tank and you let it ferment you're probably not going to get any of the bad microorganisms that cause like mold and rotting you're going to get the friendly microorganisms that you know in the kitchen from bread making you're going to get yeasts and you're going to get like lactic acid producing bacteria acetic acid producing bacteria and you let these bacteria get in there and they munch on what's left of the fruit on the seed for about a day and then what they leave behind you can just wash off it's crumbly you just blast it off with water totally clean coffee beans are what you have left you still got to dry them but they dry much more quickly and easily in this state either in the sun or in a machine you can do you still have to pop them out of a little dry husk that remains that's typically done right before export but there you go now the wet process does use a lot of water which can be a really precious resource in some places it also creates a lot of coffee processing waste water which is stinky and so there's environmental hazards associated with it if that water is not really well managed by the farmer but washed coffee tastes much more purely of the bean it's usually a little more acidic in part because that's from the bean itself it might also be from acetic acid producing bacteria involved in the fermentation process the same bacteria that make vinegar for us washed coffees taste great and perhaps more importantly washed coffees are more consistent less can go wrong here's an interesting thing i learned in this coffee history book uncommon grounds by mark pendergrast quote as the coffee industry developed during the late 19th century importers began to refer to two types of coffee brazils and milds the brazilian coffee gained a reputation for lower quality often but not always deserved and this was for a few reasons but one of them was that in brazil they were generally dry processing and often not very carefully and you get that kind of dirty taste people call it however go forward in history a little bit and a new way of processing emerged out of brazil a process that kind of splits the difference between dry and wet processing you mechanically strip off that outer skin and flesh but you don't then ferment the remaining mucilage you dry it like you would a natural coffee the result is natural pulp or honey processed coffee from the fact that the mucilage when it's dried becomes very sticky and smells very sweet almost kind of honey like and let's taste some you know they cup and taste every batch they roast there at alma just to make sure it's good at the end of the day we'll have a sink full of just little cups with a bunch of little samples in them and we probably consume what 10 plus cups a day in total with all the samples we're drinking but yikes so here's that honey processed one beans dried inside that sticky inner fruit flesh and it really is the best of both worlds it's got bright acidity a lighter body but still some of those tropical fruit notes very very tasty and this is how coffee is like wheat i recently grew and processed some wheat myself i'm going to show you that soon for thousands of years the goal was to make the whitest most refined flour you could because less refined flour just tended to be dirty literally dirty and filled with indigestible plant parts that tasted really harsh now with advanced modern processes you can make whole wheat flour that is not so harsh and crude in a lot of ways that less processed product is better same deal with coffee there's a lot of people now making really fine dry processed or honey processed coffee that is not just a cruder version of the refined washed product i think they're worth giving a shot,3

Thanks to Larry Tebben of Tebben...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.186359, this is a sponsored video about crowd cow most of my life i think i've eaten too much meat that might seem like an odd way to start a sponsored vid about an online meat market but to me crowd cow is part of the solution or a solution my solution the solution i've tried to enact in recent years has been to buy much nicer meat from producers whom i know and admire have it less often and enjoy it a whole lot more who exactly am i doing a favor by shoving garbage down my gullet myself and i think most people watching this we eat too much food period so a shift from quantity to quality makes all the sense in the world it's probably better for your body and the biosphere it's certainly better for animal welfare and it's a wash for your wallet so let me give you an example of what quality over quantity looks like take you to visit the kind of farmer you can buy from via my link in the description crowd cow.com slash regula here we are in floresville texas and the ranch owned and operated by this guy larry tebben larry and his three-legged dog are out minding the ranch and they have come across a stray calf it would be best if said calf could get into the same enclosed pasture as it's heard and other ranchers might use significantly rougher and more immediately effective means to achieve this but larry is basically just asking it nicely to go back in doesn't really work well i guess his mama told him not to go i think it would be fine all right now contrary to how this might look larry is actually very good at his job the light touch he takes with his animals is strategic you know it starts like on these baby calves you know they're they they're gentle they see their mother not run from us when we pull up to them so then as they grow up you know they have no reason to be to be in fear and so the heifers that we retain for breeding stock out of a crop they're going to be just like just like this and indeed these are simply the most chill beef cattle i have ever been around usually when i film farm animals i use this big honking 300 millimeter telephoto lens because animals are skittish and i can't get very close to them but larry's cattle came right over to me and got literally closer than the minimal proximity at which this lens can focus [Music] why so close cal why you know to achieve their genetic potential one of the most important things is they need to be raised in a stress-free environment you're a perfect stranger to them i've walked out within feet of them today okay and that tells its own story it does yeah and when he says genetic potential he's serious tebben ranch raises purebred japanese black cattle wagyu full blood american wagyu i have a whole vid about wagyu that is linked in the description but the short version is these particular breeds of cattle have the genetic ability to grow an almost comical amount of intramuscular fat it's basically beef butter you wouldn't want to eat a ton of this a little goes a long way insanely delicious now the cattle get fattest and tastiest when they are happy and they live a somewhat longer life than your typical beef cattle so a rancher like larry invests a lot of resources into keeping his animals happy that's a good thing if you like to eat heavily marbled beef it's also a good thing if you think that humans should provide the animals we eat with a lot of good days up to and including that last one when an animal is stressed you know the first part of their energy still comes from their the fat that's stored in the muscles which is the marbling so if you go chase a you know chase a stare around the pasture four or five times before it's harvested you'll you'll have some disappointing results and indeed maintaining a happy herd is about some obvious things like not pushing them around all the time but it's also about protecting them from predators and parasites it's about making sure they have access to water or shade like under these beautiful live oak trees in the cold months it's about making sure they have shelter the barn is always open to them they can get under a roof if they need to but they never do you got to remember a cow's temperature is 105 degrees to start with so you know we as humans you know we seek shelter from the cold or cold and wet either one and and you'll see a cow standing out in the 10 degree weather and it doesn't look like she's like it bothers her at all in contrast the heat there in south texas can be a problem larry says the key is basically don't ask the cattle to do anything when it's really hot you know you certainly don't work your cattle or or bring them up and deworm them or anything like that during the heat of the day or preferably not even in the in the hot months and of course stewardship of the land on which the cattle graze is paramount you're a grass farmer because the cows eat grass so you have to keep healthy soils and well-kept pastures keep invasive species out as you can probably imagine larry's approach here differs somewhat from more industrialized mainstream beef production now i am not here to trash more conventional beef production especially from an environmental sustainability standpoint there's an argument that productivity is the most important thing the more food you can make from fewer head of cattle in less time with less input of resources that's going to be less taxing to the environment on a per pound of food basis these are very complicated issues and again the best i've come up with is to say that if i'm going to eat meat i should do it a little less often and invest in stuff that is raised in a manner consistent with my values and such product usually tastes a whole lot better too so where do you find it well here's tevin ranches right here on crowd cow the marketplace for high quality meat that helps forge connections between farmers like larry and eaters like you and me it's not just american or japanese wagyu it's pretty much any meat poultry or seafood that you could think of pasture raised sustainably caught people working really hard to produce animal protein the right way crowd cow connects you to them and hey sometimes things are going to be sold out because this is not fully industrialized food the products are seasonal our product sells out just pretty fast so if you want to get yours in time this is what you do i would suggest you start by building a really big box i say order a bunch of stuff at one time far in advance because it'll

squarespace one of the most popular dishes of the southern mediterranean eggs poached in a spicy tomato sauce i love the idea of shakshouka but i've never actually liked it it's too soupy for me this recipe is my attempt to tweak shakshuka until i liked it peel and chop some garlic shakshouka just means mixture in the arabic dialect from north africa where the dish originated unless it actually came from yemen i'm not taking sides there anyway lots of different stuff can go in people use all kinds of peppers i'm doing a poblano which i think is a great all-purpose capsicum it's big and fleshy and sweet like a bell pepper but it's also a little hot like a smaller chili i'm chopping it into long strips that i can easily grab with a fork later any form of onion will work i'm using green onions because that's what i had around get rid of the roots and slice them up toward the top they get really fibrous compost those all chopping done now i am very intentionally reaching for my widest pan i want lots of surface area for rapid evaporation and lots of browning plenty of olive oil and get that heating on medium or higher in goes all of the pepper slices and most of the onions i'm holding back some of the greens for garnish and also the garlic just for now stir and give all that a head start anyway shakshuka etymology it's kind of like the word hash in english which originally just meant a bunch of stuff cut up and cooked but it came to mean a specific kind of hash same deal with shakshuka i think time to toast some spices i'm using whole cumin seeds and whole fennel seeds i like the texture of whole spices in this and i love the combination of fennel and eggs it's like an everything bagel sandwich you could use a million different spices harissa is common now i'll throw in my garlic i usually just like it barely fried and for some extra intensity of flavor brown a big squeeze of tomato paste not necessary but real good get that tomato paste in a tube it's super convenient when i'm worried it's going to burn i will pour in the juice from a standard 28 ounce can of high quality whole tomatoes about 800 grams now that the juice is out i can reach into the can and squish up all the tomatoes with my hand you can use diced or pureed tomatoes but i like the chunkier texture for this and the whole tomatoes are usually a higher quality use fresh tomatoes in season now i'm just going to boil this until it's really thick if you stir it near constantly you can use pretty high heat and it will not burn while i'm waiting i can put in some more spices some black pepper and i'm doing a bunch of smoked paprika no idea if anyone would consider that traditional and i don't particularly care give that a little pinch of salt to start with cook cook and with a super wide pan stuff evaporates really fast this is a very quick dinner or breakfast whatever now i'll crack a little can of chickpeas and drain off some of the aquafaba too much aquafaba makes the sauce kind of slimy and in those go when the sauce is looking half cooked chickpeas not super common in shakshouka but hardly unheard of and to me this makes it a more complete dish more nutritious and more satisfying i put them in halfway through because they're already cooked and i don't want them to break up too much give that a taste salt and spice content tastes good to me i want the tomatoes a little sweeter so i'm stirring in a pinch of sugar don't judge me or do i probably won't read it to keep the dish from being too soupy for my taste i'm boiling this until it's really tight almost dry look how clean the pan is when i scrape across it i'm going to turn off the heat for now that sauce is stiff enough to hold its shape when i carve out little indentations to hold my half dozen eggs just crack them into their little saucy cups if my heat was still on the first one would probably end up overcooked by the time the sixth egg was perfect people often put cheese on top usually feta i don't really like feta so i'm using gorgonzola because it had the distinct advantage of already happening to be in my fridge plus it melts unlike feta which is a plus in my book use whatever cheese you want this is a very strong blue cheese though use it with caution now i'll turn the heat back on and cook the bottom of the eggs which you should be able to see really clearly you don't have to guess whether it's happening just look through the egg window look for the bottom starting to cook now you could just cover this with a lid or foil and steam the top of the eggs until they are done to your liking i'm going to take this over the oven and put it under the broiler that top element that brits and people formerly colonized by the brits call a grill you could just put it in a hot oven of any kind but the broiler only takes 30 seconds to heat up and it will brown the top not just cook it caramelize some of those tomatoes and brown the cheese just touch or wobble the eggs to assess their doneness i want them runny but not like water balloons the sauce they're in is already wet i don't want wet on wet look at that color the wider the pan the wider the area that can brown i think it's good to season each egg a little bit on top alternatively you could kind of over season the sauce to compensate i'll sprinkle on my onion greens for color and crunch and tons of fresh herbs could work i suppose i'd normally use cilantro but i'm gonna tear on some fresh mint because i just inherited a mint plant and there's a lot of it you could scatter on some olives too that would be nice for some fresh chili those eggs would have been perfect if i hadn't been delayed moving lights and cameras around a little overcooked this is a very easy meal when you're not also trying to film it you could scoop it out but i say if your family just crowd around the pan and eat it family style the pan keeps it warm and it looks way prettier in there people generally mop up shakshuka with bread i don't know about you but i don't really need more bread in my diet i put in the chickpeas and cooked this more like a casserole than a stew so that it works all by itself with no bread and because i cooked the sauce a lot i've rounded off the tomato acidity that i usually think really clashes with eggs it's more like a tomato jam than a sauce now and hey if you really want some bread go for it and if you really want a web presence go for squarespace just like shakshuka squarespace is popular for a reason it is quick convenient and effective it's a one-pan dish say

Why food is blue (or usually isn't),https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p4_PSyhtHh0/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLAEKTAZwTPmlDeyipsbcJtoMbL41A,p4_PSyhtHh0,"12 minutes, 57 seconds","Thanks to Warby Parker for sponsoring this video!

""Discovery...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.186359, so you may have noticed that food at least naturally occurring food is rarely blue some people would argue that it's never blue i wonder why there's no blue food i love you and i miss you george but i think these are blue yeah those look blue to me though if you disagree that's not because you're wrong blue is a somewhat arbitrary social construct i mean electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength around 450 nanometers that is a real thing that's an objective reality but deciding to call that blue that's a thing that humans just made up and different people have made up very different ways of describing various different chunks of the visible light spectrum a famous example of this is blue green co-lexification lots of different people in lots of different languages all over the world have historically used the same word to refer to both blue and green blue and green are adjacent on the spectrum after all but the distinction between blue and green matters a lot to plants and this helps explain why blue is so rare in food plants are usually green the color of chlorophyll chlorophyll the stuff that helps plants convert light energy into chemical energy delicious delicious chemical energy carbs and such plants usually absorb almost all of the blue and red light they get but for reasons that are still a subject of active scientific investigation plants usually absorb less of the green light they get therefore some green light just bounces off the plant and goes into our eye therefore the thing looks green to us it's reflecting green light at us and in nature there's really only one kind of stuff that makes plants appear blue and even then this stuff more often makes them appear purplish or reddish all of these tasty plant parts get their distinctive color from anthocyanins antho from the greek word for flowers and cyanine from the greek word for dark blue or purple which is also where we get the word cyan which in english describes a very different area of the spectrum the border between blue and green because while color is an objective reality the names for colors are just things that people make up anyway anthocyanin if you ever wonder why a plant is blue or purple the answer is pretty much always anthocyanin what is anthocyanin so anthocyanins are a class of compounds found in pretty much most uh fruits vegetables plants so that is pamela denish she is a very soon to be phd at uc davis and she studies blue food legit that's what she does and it could make her a very wealthy woman someday pretty soon we'll get back to that staying with anthocyanins in plants they serve multiple roles they serve as an antibacterial as well as kind of like a sunscreen for the plant uh they absorb excess light that could be harmful to the chloroplasts um the chloroplast can only photosynthesize so much light at a time and so basically they'll burn with all the excess light if there's no filter and so anthocyanins kind of filter that light but just as there are different sun shades that filter different kinds of light there are different anthocyanins and depending on which wavelengths they reflect or absorb they can appear bluish like this shirt or reddish like the logo on it so there's over i think 700 different anthocyanins and they're all very similar they all have this uh signature central what's called a chromophore uh which is just uh three cyclical groups and then attached to that are various sugars and acyl groups and that core is actually what how it absorbs light um through super high level quantum mechanics basically it allows the electrons to kind of just move around a bunch in this core and when it absorbs light those electrons move in a way that reflect color the particular red to blue that anthocyanins will reflect is also influenced by environmental factors such as one of my favorites acidity at low ph which is like highly acidic um there's excess hydrogen atoms that shift the double bonds in the str there's a lot of double bonds in this structure it shifts them one direction and that configuration of electrons and bonds causes it to absorb everything but red so it reflects red and then when there's a higher ph uh so it's more alkaline or basic it shifts the electrons around in a way that basically they reflect blue instead so basic equals blue acidic equals purple going into red in alkaline conditions you might get a beautiful blue like we see in these frames from the sponsor of this video warby parker let me thank them real quick i am

about how acids tend to get you anthocyanins that are reddish purple and bases tend to get you anthocyanins that are more bluish purple if you are a gardening enthusiast like myself you're probably super confused right now you're thinking wait a minute when i want my hydrangeas to be blue instead of purple or pink i put down soil acidifier sulfur or aluminum sulfate soil acidifier makes hydrangeas blue yet we just heard that alkalines equal blue well another thing that influences the color of anthocyanins is the presence of metals when there's a metal ion present the anthocyanins actually coordinate around it in kind of a pinwheel configuration and like overlap with each other and form this little like puck of anthocyanins around a metal and that distorts the shape of the anthocyanin in a way that causes it to reflect blue instead of like red or purple and in the case of these flowers it's aluminum ions making them blue instead of purple or pink these soil acidifiers basically get more aluminum ions into the plant for science reasons you can see these very complex interactions unfolding as you cook blueberries at first they are blue don't say blueberries will you know they're purple yes george depending on variety and growing conditions and such blueberries might be purple but i'd call those ones blue when they really start to cook though they go to purple then if you put a big spoonful of baking soda in a base they go blue again so dark blue that they start to look black and some yellows start happening that combine with the blues and you get this repulsive green crazy stuff happening in there as a result of ph and metal ions and i'm sure other stuff i don't really understand it i don't need to understand it what we need to understand if we desire blue food is that purple is a mixture of red and blue so if you want something to be more blue than it is red then you need the blue anthocyanins as opposed to the red ones and the blue ones are harder to come by in nature there's just more anthocyanins that are red like red is the easiest or the most stable configuration of anthocyanins so you're just going to see the majority of them in that configuration um a lot fewer number of anthocyanins can assemble in the way that forms blue like so for example in red cabbage there are eight anthocyanins and only one of them does this configuration around metals that i was describing so that's the only one that can be really really blue that particular anthocyanin is of great interest to dennis and her colleagues the food industry has been looking for many years for a natural alternative to blue dye number one a synthetic colorant used to make candies and such this one anthocyanin in cabbage could do the job but there's so little of it in there that they probably have to plant like the entire earth's surface in cabbage to derive the desired quantity so the scientists here have worked out a way to use enzymes to convert other anthocyanins into this one particular anthocyanin that gives you a deep blue that is stable stable meaning it won't easily break down or change in response to changing conditions so pam dennis over there is working on putting together a company now that will market this technology that creates natural blue food coloring study weird niche things kids things like blue foods a lot of money to be made there i mean pam and friends are still making this colorant in a lab but the resulting substance is identical to this one anthocyanin found in nature in that sense the colorant is natural i know that matters from like a marketing standpoint people don't like to buy things that say they have artificial colors in them but does it actually like matter well maybe a little anthocyanins are antioxidants and there's reason to believe antioxidants are good for you maybe prevent cancer and other badness it has a positive charge and so it can absorb radicals which are just like negatively charged groups uh that can interact with our cells and cause damage and so it kind of neutralizes those anthocyanins do this for the plant as well as us animals who eat the plant this may be another reason why plants evolved to have them plants may have also evolved to be blue or purple to attract pollinators like bugs but evolution is not the only force at work in these foods no humans have been genetically manipulating food plants for millennia right for example farmers in south america ancient farmers in the andes mountains probably noticed that certain potatoes had little streaks of blue in them maybe they just thought that was pretty they just liked it for whatever reason so they selected for plants that were more purple than others and many many generations later you have blue or purple peruvian potatoes i love them but regardless of how they got in there the source of the color is anthocyanins anytime you see blue or purple in a plant red can be anthocyanins or it can be carotenoids a similar class of stuff that give you more of an orangish red like tomatoes lycopene is a carotenoid in the case of the cherokee purple tomato my favorite you've got both anthocyanins and carotenoids going on bluishness is anthocyanins in plants humans eat things other than plants right there are some blue animals but those colors are usually there as a warning i'm poisonous don't even try to eat me and then there is blue color in fungi and remember that fungi are their own thing they are not animals or plants and the colorant at work there is a different thing blue oyster mushrooms like these or the penicillium mold in this cheese they're bluish for totally different reasons that may not even be fully understood maybe we'll talk about those another day oh the ladies always say i have beautiful blue eyes okay,3

is a classic southern icebox dessert no actual cooking involved if you use canned blueberry pie filling i'll show you how to make it from scratch if you want but in brenda's house we do it her way my friend brenda savattawa is famous for her blueberry yum yum today she's showing her son chris how to do it and we get to learn too step one melt a stick and a half of butter that's six ounces 170 grams and while i'm melting that why don't you go ahead and measure three cups of graham cracker crumbs she's using the pre-pulverized crumbs but you could get the same quantity by smashing about 20 of those big rectangular graham crackers like 250 grams if you smash them yourself you can get a coarser consistency that i usually prefer but again brenda's house i use it because it's easy easy sweeten those up with a quarter cup of sugar 50 grams then pour in all the melted butter all right mix that up good this is maybe a little more butter than you'd normally use to bind a graham cracker pie crust but remember we're not baking this so we're not going to rely on the starch and sugar to set into a structural matrix we're simply relying on the butter to congeal in the fridge and hold this stuff solid it'll look like wet sand at this stage then you just set aside one big scoop of it maybe a third of a cup for later put it in here okay this is for your top for the topping this is for your sprinkle top then the bulk of those crumbs go into the dish he's got like a 9 by 13 inch dish there but again because there's no baking you don't have to worry about like oh if my dish is too small then the surface to mass ratio will be too low and the outside will burn before the inside is cooked it's just going in the fridge it can be any dimension you could do little individual ones the one thing you probably want to be sure to do is press the crumb into the dish this will make it set solid and here's part of the reason why you want it to be really pat down hard is because when you get ready to spread that whipped cream on there when you're spreading on loose things you're going to get all that crumble so make sure it's nice see how that is right there to that end the dish with the crust in it goes into the fridge to chill while we get the other layers ready open up two eight-ounce blocks of cream cheese one pound 453 grams you know the the hardest part of this recipe is remembering to keep your cream cheese out to soften cream cheese is often packaged in aluminum foil to prevent oxidation and you can't put metal in the microwave you could unwrap it and nuke it at very low power to soften it it just has to be soft so you can beat in one cup of sugar 200 grams just until smooth that looks pretty good does that look good yeah here we need to um get your little spatula and scoop down the sides and push them in the middle time now for the whipped cream brenda has a chilled bowl in the freezer cream whips faster if it's really cold i think that matters a lot more if you're whipping it by hand with a whisk two cups of cream a pint half a liter plus a quarter cup of powdered sugar 40 grams maybe you can use granulated sugar but powdered grains are less sharp less likely to pop your bubbles and the little bit of starch and powdered sugar helps stabilize the foam okay so that's not a soft peak that's still liquidy and give it another minute the problem with whipped cream is that if you take it too far all of a sudden it bunches up and gets a texture like cottage cheese it still tastes okay but it doesn't look pretty so brenda just takes it to very conservative soft peaks because there's still more whipping to come she drops in the cream cheese mixture just a little bit you don't want big old globs just smaller gloves she's just trying to get this integrated while deflating the foam as little as possible so first she kind of folds the globs into the cream with a spatula and then back in with the beater for just a brief minute we're going to ensure that everything is mixed up together because we don't want to beat the whipped cream down and there you go nice and smooth though the detached beater has attracted the attention of a third generation in the room is it yum here take the whole thing now the chilled crust comes out of the fridge and you drop about half the cream mixture down in dollops you want to be able to spread it to a thin layer with as few strokes as possible if you're too rough with the spatula you're going to get all these crumbles up in the in the middle of the mixture you don't it'll eventually get in the mixture it'll all be mixed in in my belly time now for the blueberries two 21 ounce cans of blueberry pie filling a little over a kilo total you can make it yourself but this is a recipe for people living in the real world the kind of people for whom the sponsor of this video is a big help hellofresh let me thank them for a sec hellofresh is america's number one meal kit and i love it me a guy who kind of knows how to cook i love not having to worry about coming up with the recipe and shopping for it every night of the week hellofresh consistently sends me very tasty very efficient recipes that get us a ton of flavor and good nutrition in like 20 or 30 minutes of cooking because the ingredients come pre-portioned there's hardly any food waste look at the tiny cucumber it's more sustainable this way and i love getting to try new ingredients without having to buy a whole big thing of it that'll just sit in my pantry pearl couscous there throw in the chicken you don't have to get meat meals you can get veggie plans local lots of plans and you can switch between them or you can pause deliveries if you need a break go to hellofresh.com and use code adam regucia12 to get 12 free meals including free shipping my link and code are in the description 12 free meals with my code adamergucia12 thank you hellofresh now if you did want to make your pie filling yourself maybe because you have fresh picked blueberries here's how i would do it like three pints of blueberries in a pot about a kilo dump in a cup of sugar 200 grams heat on high and if you stir this the heat and the sugar will break these down but you can accelerate the process by mashing them a bit that's just a potato masher bring everything to a boil and cook until the berries have just started to break apart and kind of visibly melt into that solution i still think you want big chunks to thicken this you'd want at least a quarter cup of starch at least 30 grams maybe twice as much if you want a really solid set consistency and i'm just dissolving it in the minimum amount of water necessary when it's a thick slurry like this it's very easy to break up any remaining lumps with your finger or just by shaking it real hard then you gotta stir constantly as you drizzle it into the boiling liquid if you just dump it in you'll get this giant glob of starch gel that you can't dissolve it should visibly thicken right away but it'll thicken more as it cools for me blueberry yum yum is better if there's a little more acidity in the fruit to cut the richness so i'm juicing in some lemon to taste the acid will break down the cornstarch a bit as this sits in the fridge over time if that bothers you if you really want that very firm consistency plus a lot of acidity i'd go with a pie thickener like clear gel that's a modified starch that you can buy i might also play with some spices christmasy spices like cloves and cinnamon go great with blueberries and here's how it looks after it's chilled you want to spread it on the yum yum when it's chilled but again brenda's house brenda's rules two cans okay so you're going to spread it all the way yep then it's time to drop on the rest of the cream and this can be tricky to do without smearing the layers together when you glob it you want to glob and roll kind of like a glove and blob and roll okay just keep a little bit in that bowl like that because you might need it for to fix your errors with this kind of thing i find it always helps to just kind of pull with the spatula in one direction swipe the cream over you see what i said about keep a little bit to fix your i guess it doesn't really matter because once you put graham crackers on yeah these will make just about anything look pretty that's the scoop of crust that we reserved from before dust that on and then all three generations were kind enough to plop on those fresh blueberries that i picked but you could put any fruit on there maybe something more acidic to balance the sweet canned filling and you could eat that right now but the layers would not hold together at all it would scoop into a homogeneous blob chill it for a few hours and it'll scoop real clean like that and our family is the edge we have those that won't just want the crust others that want the blueberries and others so you know we got we can make everybody happy you know we grew up very poor you know food stamps and um commodity food commodity foods the word commodity in this context means these giant generic processed foods that the us government buys to subsidize agribusinesses and then turns around and gives to people on food assistance so when you're when you're poorer you know you had to work with what you had with commodities and food stamps and this is one of those like it looks like an expensive dessert it tastes like an expensive dessert but it doesn't cost hardly anything you could use the commodity crackers you had to buy the blueberry filling of course and cream cheese but dream whip was like a dollar a box so yummy yummy yum yum damn right yum yum,3

in something closer to its original traditional form the version used today in processed foods soaps cosmetics biofuels all kinds of things might look more like this or maybe like this it can be refined into innumerable forms but all of them are fats derived from the fruit of the oil palm this is by far the number one edible grease in the whole wide world this and derivatives of this are in probably dozens of products in your home right now quite possibly on or in your body is that a bad thing probably yeah i think so probably a bad thing at least from an environmental standpoint though i'm not at all convinced that the alternatives would be much better unless you think that stop guzzling so much grease is an alternative probably should be if you're wondering how palm oil ended up in everything and endangered the world you're in luck because that's the subtitle of the new book planet palm by long time food and environmental journalist jocelyn zuckerman the meat of the fruit is um gets crushed and that's where you get the palm oil and then inside there's a kernel and you can also crush that and you get palm kernel oil so you get two different kinds of oil from the fruit and the oil from the kernel is mostly mostly used in cosmetics so this is the former this is oil made from the fruit part of the fruit it was made in ghana the oil palm is native to west africa where this has been like the cooking oil for thousands of years in its relatively unrefined form like this it tastes real strong i don't know how to describe it it's got this sort of bitter thing going on this very vegetal thing kind of has the aroma of my spice drawer the first thing you probably noticed was the color right that color is from keratinoids the same things that make carrots and tomatoes and salmon orange but the stuff that's used in processed foods has been treated in all these different ways so as to make it basically tasteless odorless colorless the other thing you probably noticed about this is that it is thick palm oil is 50 saturated fat so it's semi-solid at room temperature the oil made from the kernel or seed of the fruit is even more saturated this is like 80 percent saturated this is palm kernel oil because they're so saturated these fats behave more like animal fats which are generally pretty saturated right as a result they are solid at room temperature or semi-solid at room temperature and they are less quick to go bad less quick to oxidize go rancid where i live in the american south the really abundant oil a century or two ago was cottonseed oil a byproduct of the cotton textile industry that oil is mostly unsaturated so it went bad real fast and it's liquid so you can't make soap or biscuits with it the industrialist who built this house in macon georgia was among the geniuses who figured out that you could add hydrogen atoms to unsaturated fats and you can make them more viscous and more shelf stable hence crystallized cottonseed oil crisco i have a whole bit about that linked in the description if instead you get your oil from a palm tree it's already saturated there's no need for fancy modern industrial processing already saturated this is a very rare property for a plant oil to have the oil you get from the giant seed or kernel of the coconut tree is like 90 saturated what we think of as a coconut the brown and white thing that is the coconuts kernel 90 saturated that fat is but the coconut palm tree does not yield as much oil as the oil palm tree does the oil palms productivity is insane in africa they're very tall and thin and people had to climb up them and it was often false would be found the way they're bred now particularly in southeast asia they don't grow as tall and the trunks are much thicker um so but the original ones look just like a coconut palm what i found so interesting when i was researching this book was that basically the infrastructure for the slave trade when the slave trade was outlawed um the the british traders started sourcing palm oil um and used that same infrastructure it was particularly in the um niger delta sort of swamp area and then rivers that go up into the interior where the oil palm trees grew naturally so the canoes that they used to use to shuttle human beings for the slave trade they then started shuttling palm oil um and it was used during the second industrial revolution for soaps in particular people were starting to work in factories and going home really dirty and so soap became much bigger thing also for use in them lighting lamps and eventually in margarines ah margarine oil-based butter replacements is there anything more emblematic of what food writer michael pollan calls the american paradox his books like the omnivores dilemma are available now on audible the sponsor of this video let's thank them and hear what pollen means by that speaking of something called the french paradox for how could a people who eat such demonstrably toxic substances as foie gras and triple cream cheese actually be slimmer and healthier than we are yet i wonder if it doesn't make more sense to speak in terms of an american paradox that is a notably

margarine vegetable oil based butter replacements could be made with naturally saturated palm oil that could also be made with unsaturated oils that have been partially hydrogenated the problem with that of course is that it results in trans fats which medical science now regards is basically the worst kind of fat that you can eat indeed crisco now is no longer made with trans fats or if there is trans fat in here it's a very very small amount what's in here instead well a few things but one of them is palm oil the big push to eliminate trans fats from processed foods is certainly part of palm oil's meteoric rise but it's not even close to being the whole story in our new book here jocelyn zuckerman shows how palm oil is popular because yes it is naturally well suited to many commercial applications and because it is extremely cheap part of the reason this is so cheap is because of how productive the oil palm is the yield that you get per acre of cultivated land is insane it's miles ahead of any other oil crop but there's another reason this is cheap stolen land slave labor big part of it the story of the modern palm oil industry begins with the introduction of that african tree into southeast asia most of today's palm oil comes from malaysia and indonesia basically it grows best um 10 degrees to the north and south of the equator so it's basically that tropical belt around the world these are basically the same places where rubber trees grow and european colonial rubber plantations started to shift to oil palm when synthetic rubber started to eat into their business but then after independence these governments had lots of poor people and um so gave them parcels of land and oil palm seedlings and encouraged them to grow oil promise as i said a poverty lake alleviation scheme and then once the industry learned how to fractionate and process it into all these different uses then it was they were able to just sell it more around the world the resulting deforestation of vital tropical rainforest has been huge in its contribution to global warming and in its devastation of habitat you've probably already heard about the whole orangutan thing orangutans are the closest living relative to humanity if you've ever looked at one in the eye it is straight up like looking at a person orangutans are losing their homes to oil palms though they are hardly the only important species to be affected how about humans so in malaysia and indonesia in particular malaysia has a smaller population and higher standard of living so a lot of malaysians aren't particularly interested in in these like menial jobs on the oil pump plantations so they rep they um rely on a lot of imported labor um often from bangladesh from myanmar um rohingya and a lot of these folks are brought in under false pretenses um they recruiters come to their villages and say we can get you jobs in restaurants or in other hotels um they put them on a boat and then they traffic them in and then they land on these plantations often they confiscate their passports um and they have to pay basically pay off these wages that they've paid to the recruiters in advance thinking that they're going to get good jobs and then they're stranded on these plantations and some of them have had to literally you know make escapes um under cover of night now the united states and other countries have banned imports from or otherwise sanctioned certain palm oil producers over these abuses but zuckerman's reporting shows how it can be really hard to trace the origin of oil once it gets all blended together in the international commodities market and refining process so that's what she means by slave labor what does she mean by stolen land well by way of example she travels in her book here to liberia where the government there is getting its oil palm industry going by renting jungle to big companies that land is inhabited but not by people living a modern developed economy type lifestyle people like that are hard to displace without significant compensation but people living an older or traditional lifestyle are often less able to assert their rights the people were who had lived on that land they got tiny payments and but they now had no place to farm or to live and they said that their their rivers were poisoned because of the um the agrichemicals um but the the government you know wanted to use this as a poverty alleviation scheme and so the governments tend to be on the side of the companies that are giving them there's also often lots of corruption involved so the companies are paying government officials who maybe don't care so much about the people who are actually living in these villages or in these forests that are then raised in her book zuckerman also travels to central america workers there on oil palm plantations are fighting to unionize to improve their horrific working conditions they get snake bites they have falls stuff falls on them they get covered in agra chemicals all while making pitiful wages i interviewed one man who had tried to come to the states on one of the um caravans and he said you know i've worked for this company for 10 years and it's just nothing you just can't support he had three kids he said there's no way to support a family even though i'm working he was working six days a week basically around the clock now labor abuses are in agriculture all over the world but the concentration of the palm oil industry in these equatorial nations with their particular economic and political problems and histories probably makes this particular crop more of a center of badness so what are you as a conscientious consumer to do well of course you can try to buy less palm oil about two-thirds of it gets consumed in foods the most conspicuous place you'll generally see it is in pre-packaged baked goods where they need a shelf-stable solid fat but of course any other vegetable oil is going to have its own problems they all take far more land to produce oil that's one of the reasons why palm oil is popular it doesn't take much land and honestly looking at labels will only get you so far especially considering that palm oil is fractionated and added to a million products under a million different names even if you somehow get all palm oil out of your diet it's still probably in your bathroom it's in your toothpaste and your makeup and your shampoo and your moisturizer you can look for products with an rspo label it's conferred by the round table on sustainable palm oil when i was in honduras i talked to folks on these plantations and they said the rspo investigators had just been there and they said one we were coached before they came we were given a script this is what we're supposed to say about how great our working conditions are and then after they after the inspectors left they said that those who didn't follow the script were punished or fired um those who did were given a banquet with soda and food in her book zuckerman goes to ecuador and visits small holder farms that work with natural habitats it's a company that tries to buy and sell palm oil the right way she was super impressed you could look for that but it's a tiny sliver of the market in general i think this is one of those problems that people like me can't just consume our way out of people like me in the united states most of us probably just need to consume less period though what country consumes the most palm oil it's india as a as a cooking oil and then also in in all those chips and snacks that they make but um the as you may know there's so many street vendors in india and um when i was over there it seemed that they were all using palm oil because it was cheaper than the other oils that they could get and it was interesting because they denied it at first they said no we're not using palm oil then i could see the wrapper underneath them and same with the shopkeepers i was with them a woman from the public health foundation of india and we went into some shops and asked for cheap oil and they gave us mustard oil and soy oil i believe and then we said don't you have anything cheaper at first i said no and then he said okay well here's the palm oil so there's like there's the stigma about it because they sort of know that it's not healthy and because it's not grown domestically um but they're all using it because it's cheaper i think it's dumb when we focus our consumption guilt on one product or one ingredient or one company that's the kind of thinking that leads us to loudly decline something on moral grounds while quietly accepting something just as bad over here except now with some smug moral superiority mixed in what you do with this information is up to you but this is what palm oil is this is how it ended up in like everything and this is why some very smart people are very worried about that,3
Fresh tagliatelle with no pasta machine | mushroom cream sauce,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IQMp0m0xjIE/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLAZeasLu79pPeqIUjltLYHE2sTVUg,IQMp0m0xjIE,"8 minutes, 8 seconds",Thanks to Misen for sponsoring this video!

it might be easier to make fresh pasta with just a rolling pin and your counter — no
pasta rolling machine to get out and assemble and clean. I'm gonna show you how I do it
and then we'll make a super quick and delicious creamy mushroom sauce for it. You can mix your pasta dough in a bowlm but
since we're gonna get the counter dirty anyway when we roll this out, I'ma just do everything
right here. A cup of flour, 120g to start with. And one egg per portion is a good rule
of thumb. I'm making two. Carve a little well in the center of the flour pile and crack
them in. To me, the biggest reason to make my own pasta
is to make egg pasta. Fresh egg pasta is a totally different taste and texture from anything
else and it's so good. Half teaspoon of Morton kosher. I increasingly think fresh pasta comes
out better if you season the dough directly, at least little bit — rather than just relying
on salty boil water. With my fork I'll get those eggs beaten and
mixed into the flour as much as possible before I have no choice but to get in with my hands.
Knead and knead and knead. It always feel like it's never gonna come together until
it does. Keep the faith. Once it is together, but it becomes too sticky to work, I'll dust
on more flour. With pasta, you generally just knead in however
much flour the dough can take. And my basic technique is to gather up my dough, put my
palm on the ball and then lean into it with my bodyweight. Gather the dough back up into
a ball and repeat. Very physically efficient — requires hardly any strength because your
weight and gravity are providing the force. After a good 8 minutes of kneading my dough
is pretty smooth and elastic, it's hardly sticky at all anymore and it's therefore not
taking much more flour. We're pretty much done. I am using the dough as a broom of sorts
to grab up any flakes of dough that are stuck to the counter. If we don't get those off,
they'll dry and then flake off and stick to the dough later as we roll it out here, and
they won't fully rehydrate then so then they'll mess with the texture. Just use the dough
to scrub the counter clean. There we go, barely sticky. That'll be easy
to roll out by hand, but you still want to cover it with a damp towel or something and
let it rest at least 15 minutes or so. It rolls out easier after it rests a bit. While we wait we can prep everything else.
I'll peel and chop a few garlic cloves — you can't beat the combination of garlic and mushrooms.
I've got a pint of cremini mushrooms — that's 4 oz, 113g. Just about any mushroom variety
would be fine. I'll trim any particularly woody stem ends off and then slice. No need
to get them paper thin. They'll shrink a lot when they cook and I like them to have some
texture. Now we'll need a little pot of water for boiling.
I'll give that a pinch of salt too just cover my bases. Heat on high. And for the mushroom
sauce I'll use my high-carbon steel pan from the sponsor of this video, Misen. Let me thank
them real quick. Misen makes shockingly robust cookware given
their entry-level prices. Every pan I have from them is way more solid and hefty than
any comparably priced stuff that I've handled. This is how my carbon steel pan arrived. I
just melted off the packing wax and then you season the pan just like cast iron. Unlike
other oils, this seasoning wax that comes with the pan actually smells good as you polymerize
it into a naturally nonstick coating. Just follow the directions. High-carbon steel holds
onto that seasoning much in the way cast iron does, but you also get the superior thermal
conductivity of steel. It heats up a lot faster and more evenly, and check out that removably
rubber handle. Like medium-high heat, a good coating of olive oil and this pan is great
for mushrooms, which tend to stick to pans the same way meat does. They brown great in
that Misen pan. Hit my link in the description, use promo
code ragusea and get yourself 20% off your first order from Misen — on this pan or
anything. Use my link, enter code ragusea at at checkout, save 20%. Thank you, Misen. Now, this could be enough mushrooms for two
portions, but I like a lot of mushrooms and I like to cook them down a lot to concentrate
their flavor. So I'ma put in another pint. This one is pre-sliced — that's fine as
long they're fresh. Hey there's some yellow oyster mushrooms in there too. I'll just stir continuously, at least for
the early phase, until I've built some brown crust on these and a lot of water stars to
come out. Once the pan is water wet like that, it's safe to let them go unattended for a
moment while we get our pasta ready. A big handful of flour to keep it from sticking
as we roll, and roll we shall. I basically do this the way I do pastry. Roll at little
and then turn it. Roll, turn. Turning it or even flipping it helps you make sure every
surface is getting a fresh dusting of flour and nothing is sticking. Plus turning helps
you roll more evenly in all directions. You can be much rougher with this than you are
with pastry, though. Don't be delicate. Really dig in there with the corner of the pin. I'll pause to stir my mushrooms, and if you
feel like they're getting out ahead of you, just take the pan off the heat. Mushrooms
can wait for a long time without anything bad happening to them. You may be wondering: Without a rolling machine,
how do roll it to even thickness? How do I know how thin to make it? Well, the good news
is you don't have to worry about that, because it's nearly impossible to get this very, very
thin with a rolling pin. Just get all of it as thin as you physically can, and everything
will be pretty even and it definitely won't be too thin. The bad news is your noodles
are probably gonna be a little thick, a little rustic. But if we play our cards right, they'll
be satisfyingly thick. Thicc, with two Cs. I'll make sure that's well-floured and not
sticky before I fold it up a few times and throw it on a cutting board. I find a sawing
motion works better than straight downward pressure. If you just push down, it tends
to crush the layers together more and make them stick to each other. I'm going for tagliatelle-type
width on these, keeping in mind they're gonna swell like 50% when they cook. Once cut, you either need drape them over
something, like a drying rack where they can hold for awhile without sticking to each other,
or you can just toss them around in a little flour to get them unraveled and then cook
them within a few minutes. Once they're in a pile like that, you're committed and you
gotta cook them soon before they stick. This is why I got my mushrooms going in advance. They're back on the heat now and looking cooked,
so I'll throw in my garlic and let it just barely cook for a minute before deglazing
with ... fine Scotch whiskey. It might seem weird, but I think barrel-aged spirits go
amazing with mushrooms and/or cream, even with otherwise-Italian flavors. Sometime I
use brandy, sometimes I use bourbon. You could totally deglaze with a splash of water instead
— this just gives the sauce some extra depth. Then just enough cream to just cover the mushrooms.
Once that's in, the timing should work out perfect if we drop the pasta now. Give it
a stir to make sure the noodles aren't sticking to the pan or each other. Fresh pasta cooks
in like two minutes. Stir that simmering cream, meanwhile. And give it a conservative seasoning.
We can add more salt at the end to taste. And just when the pasta seems to have swollen
a bit and go noticeably more buoyant, it's done. If anything, I want to undercook this
a bit before it goes in the sauce. And pasta water is the other main component
of the sauce. You could catch some in cup as you drain — I'm simply gonna not drain
this very thoroughly and have faith the proportions are gonna work out. There's tons of wiggle
room here. Toss that around, get everything combined. I think it's gonna need more moisture. That
sauce texture might look perfect now, but it's gonna thicken a ton by the time it cools
on the plate and we actually start eating. I'ma loosen it with some more Scotch, but
water would be fine. More cream would do it, as long as it doesn't get cooked very much. You could finish now with some fresh herb.
Tarragon would go with these flavors. Parsley would be nice. But today I'm gonna do an alternative to finishing
with herbs. I'm gonna dump in a really big handful of arugula. Any delicate salad green
that you have leftover in the fridge could work — watercress, baby spinach. And it
will fit in two seconds if you can just get it worked into the pan a little. It will wilt
down almost instantly. Finishing pasta with tender greens gets you
vibrant color and freshness without all the powerful aromas of herbs. If you want to the
other flavors of your dish to ring clear, this works great. I want to taste the mushrooms
and the whiskey today. Taste for salt content, add more if needed and you're done. Look at how much that sauce has tightened
in just the last few seconds — I could have put in even more moisture. Because these are rough, hand-rolled noodles
their texture is on the verge dumping consistency, but I love that and it works great with the
mushrooms. The whole dish is satisfyingly toothsome. Not something you wanna eat every
day, this heap of carbs and dairy fat and booze. I'm gonna have some regrets later,
but at the moment I'm a happy man.",3

mileage out of that footage right now buckle up this is not a plant nor even part of a plant it is part of a fungus and fungi are their own kingdom of life totally apart from plants or animals fungi are their own thing from a culinary perspective i think they're really more like animals they usually have complete protein all the essential amino acids we need and we find in all meat but only a few plants mushrooms stick to pans the same way that meat does they brown the same way that meat does they're rich in glutamates the source of that meaty umami taste and they even kind of look like meat and they feel like meat when you chew them in light of all these factors it should not be surprising that from a biological perspective this actually is closer to an animal than it is to a plant says who says her my name is dr bingo daniels i'm a mythologist so animals like you and me we have stomachs and we have to you know eat food plants have to make their food and fungi are a lot more similar to animals even though they don't have stomachs they have to secrete enzymes and acids and kind of digest their food and then slurp it back up yum well another fungus that we deal with in the kitchen all the time is yeast right and maybe yeast don't seem very animal like because they are unicellular one cell per organism but mushrooms or the fungi that make mushrooms are multicellular complex beings with organs or at least organ-like structures the mushroom that we eat is basically an organ of the fungus specifically it's a reproductive organ kind of even looks like it doesn't it the mushroom is only part of the fungus it's kind of an attachment and appendage of the fungus this is an imperfect analogy for reasons that we'll explain later but for right now go with it if you think about our appendages they are part of us but if you cut one off we are still ourselves right our self is here our main body is here the appendage is part of us but it's not integral to us similar thing down here cut the mushroom away and the fungus's main body is still there you just can't see it so whenever you look at a mushroom you should think of it as the tip of the iceberg there's all of this stuff underneath the soil and it's probably the biggest part of that organism it's down in there inside the rotting tree or whatever other substrate the fungus is slowly digesting and slurping up the organism's main body is inside the wood and here it is the mycelium if any part of the fungus is the fungus this is it and these particular ones in petri dishes belong to hunter pruitt farmer owner of middle georgia mushroom it's really the world's decomposer this little organism right here breaks down the the lignin in the tree then continues on just just plowing through it it goes in through the bark usually right where the bark meets the wood and it just climbs up and colonizes that tree but that only happens as that tree is dead and as that tree is starting to decay that's the importance of mushrooms in our society if if we didn't have them our forest would be just piled high full of trees that have grown and fell if they could grow anymore because there would be nothing to decay and decompose that rotted wood right as you can see this organism is about way more than dinner i mean i love mushrooms super tasty super pretty but the mycelium the hidden mycelium that's really where the action is when it comes to this being they sort of are doing a lot of things on a cellular level in the mycelia that is sort of like beneath notice like they're recombining they're exchanging they're you know kind of you know having sex with themselves it's very racy stuff these mushrooms and then once they've done that then they make the fruiting body and they kind of produce spores fruiting body is the more scientific and broader term that encompasses mushrooms mushroom is an informal word that people tend to use to describe the types of fruiting bodies that we would normally eat the archetypal mushroom is this guy the white button it's got a stem a cap and gills underneath but there are other species that are very morphologically different and yet we also call them mushrooms like morels or these beautiful lion's mane mushrooms that hunter grows very tasty very different from a toadstool type mushroom and yet we call them mushrooms anyway probably just because we eat them what i've been showing you here on this dead tree in my neighborhood is a polypore or bracket fungus people usually call these fruiting bodies conchs not mushrooms even though they're the same basic thing as a mushroom it's an umbrella the mycelium sends up to drop its spores into the wind spreading its genetic material far and wide biologically it's basically the same thing as a mushroom but the fruiting bodies of polypores are really really hard and woody usually and so people don't usually eat them and so nobody calls them mushrooms they call them conchs same deal with this lychen british soldier lichen they call it because the fruiting bodies reminded people of redcoats those fruiting bodies are also super hard so nobody ever thinks about eating them so maybe that's why nobody ever calls them mushrooms but again biologically speaking it's the same basic thing it's an arm reaching up from the fungus and casting its spores into the wind so they will go off and grow into fungus junior look at this plated mycelium in the lab at middle georgia mushroom see those little blue dots there those are the very beginnings of fruiting bodies blue oyster mushrooms specifically that's how they look when they're all grown up when they're super tiny like this they're called pins here's what those pins look like a few days later and a few days after that pink oyster mushrooms in this case yum and under the microscope you can see those black dots those are the spores getting ready to drop most people think mushrooms taste best when you harvest them right before they start to drop their spores after that the fruiting body starts to decompose and go slimy because when the spores are done the mushroom has finished its job the mycelium doesn't need it anymore so that's one answer to the question what even is a mushroom it is the temporary reproductive appendage of a fungus here's where that appendage analogy breaks down to varying extents animals like us can regenerate severed parts the way a fungus can break off the lizard's tail it grows a new tail but the severed tail does not grow a new lizard if you were to say chop off my hand my hand would cease to be an organism it would just become a heap of dying cells i'm the organism the hand is not going to regrow a whole extra human attached to it though i wish it would i could use a second pair of hands around here but unfortunately with humans this is just not possible with fungi though this is exactly what can happen you can cut off a part of the fungus that's what that thing in the middle is and under the right conditions that severed part will grow into a clone of the original fungus that's what hunter is doing in this petri dish he's cloning a particularly good genetic specimen that he wants to grow more of this is possible in part because of what the fungus is made out of almost all of this fungus the above ground part and the below ground part they're all made out of the same basic material called hyphae a hypha is a string of fungal cells often only one cell wide it's that thin they're these long very thin sort of like filaments and then they sort of like twist and wind together to create greater structures down in the mycelium those filaments twist themselves into these parallel chords called rhizomorphs they call that because they look and function a lot like plant roots rhizome is a kind of plant root they serve as like highways so you know they're secreting enzymes they're moving out into the environment they're searching for food and they're kind of transporting it throughout these networks it's really cool when the mycelium is ready to send out its spores those hyphae just grow up and out and then tangle around each other into these big wadded masses that's the fruiting body the fruiting body is literally just a tangled mass of those same hyphae the mushroom and the mycelium are made out of the same stuff probably the main reason we eat the fruiting body and not the mycelium is that it'd be really hard to disentangle all of those little filaments from the rotting wood that they are growing through right though there is a notable case of mycelia that people do eat tempeh this surprisingly tasty indonesian meat substitute consists of soybeans bound in the mycelium of the fungus that is eating them we eat the whole thing and it is a fermented protein-rich delight speaking of protein and carbs and other delicious things that we like and need to eat why are they in here why does the mushroom have them i mean you can think of all of the components of a mushroom serving a function to that microorganism that's not undifferent from like the proteins and carbs in our bodies fair enough but if we look at plants their fruits often contain these delicious and nourishing substances expressly for us animals to eat a tomato for example is full of sugar in part because the vine that grew it wants me to eat its fruit so that i will then disperse the seeds contained therein so does the mushroom want to be eaten in the same way dr bianco daniel says not really from what we know about mushrooms a lot of their spore dispersal so how they kind of get to new environments is done by the wind in the rain i think that maybe the exception that i can think of off the top of my head would be like truffles so truffles have this very sort of like potent smell that's attractive not just us but there's whole categories of truffles that i've heard people refer to as like squirrel truffles and they exist just so that you know rodents smell them and they smell amazing and the rodents dig them up because they think they want to eat them and then in the process of doing that they kind of free the spores into the air and kind of also get them on their little paws and transport them everywhere and kind of spread it but of course truffles are a rare case in more ways than one primarily the nutrients inside a fruiting body are there for its own benefit not ours this is probably why many mushrooms have evolved to be deadly poisonous to us animals i mean i love mushrooms and i know a fair bit about them but i still would never go out foraging for mushrooms that i planned to eat unless i had an experienced guide with me like hunter pruitt once you get past your visual and common identification methods you move into certain color spore prints and certain color certain color bruising patterns and it can really get overwhelming especially with the amount of species that we have on this planet right it is so complicated made more complicated by the fact that mushrooms change dramatically in their appearance over the course of their very rapid growth cycle consider the death cap which is exactly what it sounds like it's relatively easy to spot when it's full grown but when it's just coming up it looks a lot like an edible straw mushroom people confuse them all the time and the ammo toxins in the mushroom just destroy their liver and kidneys this is no joke so if you want to get your hands on some mushrooms that are more interesting than the ones they maybe have down at the grocery store might i suggest buying a grow kit like the ones that hunter sells he knows exactly what species he's putting in there for you and i used one of his kits to grow my pink oysters down in the basement a ton of

***BASE RECIPE, MAKES ~30 BISCOTTI***

1 stick...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.186359, biscotti are twice baked cookies very crunchy very dry very dippable i love them but sometimes i think they can be just jaw shattering so i've tried to get a dough recipe here that's a little more tender a little more delicate and it works as a flavor neutral base you can mix it up divide it and then bake a few different flavors all at once step one is to soften a stick of butter either by leaving it out or microwaving it on low power 10 or 15 seconds at a time nuke rotate nuke rotate very carefully until it's soft not melted that's four ounces 113 grams then one and one-third cups of sugar about 270 grams in that big mixing bowl i will cream the butter and the sugar as best i can the sugar quantity is kind of high for this you might not get the butter looking super fluffy but you're still definitely cutting little air bubbles into the fat that'll make the texture lighter at the end the purportedly original biscotti recipe from tuscany has no fat at all in it do that if you want but the butter is what gets you more of a shortbread taste and texture i think literally every english language recipe i've seen has fat in it like any other cookie i'm gonna crack in three eggs you could divide this whole recipe by three if you wanted a smaller batch and while almond is the traditional flavoring i'm gonna put a little splash of vanilla in at this stage we'll do the almond flavor later get that beaten really smooth to the point where you can see it making ribbons like that again this will lighten the texture at the end i used unsalted butter today so i'm putting in half a teaspoon of morton kosher about three grams that'll make these just a little noticeably salty which i want a scant half teaspoon of baking powder a couple of grams again the traditional recipe has no leavening at all and three cups of flour to start with 360 grams we're gonna add more this is just the baseline get all that mixed in and smooth at this point it's about as wet and sticky as a typical cookie dough for biscotti i think you'd traditionally mix in enough flour to where it's barely wet or sticky at all i'm going for a happy medium i think i ended up putting in almost a whole additional cup so maybe 470 480 grams total four cups there's a lot of wiggle room here i like it when it's dry enough that it doesn't stick to you when you smash it like that but it does still feel wet that's our base dough that's going to be moist enough to be tender but still dry enough to absorb your morning brew which you could enjoy whilst reading morning brew the sponsor of this video that's what i do morning brew is a free daily newsletter that rounds up the latest in business finance and tech i find it's a much more pleasant way for me to keep informed instead of mindlessly scrolling through people yelling on social media morningbrew starts with market news written in a fun voice that's easy to understand even if you're not a stocks nerd then they'll summarize all the day's big stories u.s and eu talking about waving patent protections for vaccines for obvious reasons i like how morning brew lays out this text if i want to know the counter argument it's bolded and set apart easy for my eye to find the whole newsletter is always super skimmable and the writing is entertaining without being patronizing do you and me both a favor and subscribe using my link in the description it's completely free and takes less than 15 seconds to sign up there's no reason to not subscribe to morning brew if you're interested in business finance or tech follow my link in the description thank you morning brew now i'll get a couple of smaller bowls and divide this dough roughly into thirds for three different flavors chocolate chips are nice but so are butterscotch chips maybe a quarter cup of those and an equal quantity of say pecans i think nuts work much better in biscotti than they do in softer cookies i threw an extra dose of vanilla in there and i'll mix that up it's great to do multi-flavor biscotti when you have tons of little half bags of random chunkies left over from previous baking adventures this will be my almond one white chocolate chips are very nice with almonds whole ore slivered whatever and here's my almond extract much stronger than vanilla extract so be careful though i'm still liking a big splash just for fun let's color this in the logic of sweets almond is sometimes green just as raspberry is sometimes blue lord knows why put in a little more color than you think you want because it's going to lighten a bit as it bakes at this point we've added enough moisture that i think i want to mix in a little extra flour if i don't roughly match the texture of the other dough this one will spread more in the oven and maybe over bake done i'll wipe off the beaters a bit but i'm deliberately mixing these in ascending order of darkness so that i don't really have to worry about color pollution you won't see the green through the brown a couple of tablespoons of dutch cocoa like 15 grams and i'm gonna balance that with an extra pinch of sugar and a little glug of oil this counters the coco's drying effect then let's play some more peanut butter chips and i've got some whole macadamia nuts i deliberately did the chocolate dough in the biggest mixing bowl because it tends to make a mess when you mix it and it might be so dense that you have to knead it a little by hand i find that the chocolate dough has to feel a little firmer and drier than the others if you want it to cook and spread at the same rate as the others baking sheet with some parchment if you don't have parchment i'd grease and flour it a bit i'll form my dough into a thick snake and then flatten it a little bit same deal with greeny thick snake then flatten into a long bar this gets you a pretty even thickness and baking throughout each piece again i'm shaping in ascending order of darkness so that i don't have to wash my hands the chocolate dough should feel a little stiffer and drier if it doesn't it's going to spread really flat couldn't tell you why now you can have some fun with toppings i've got some demerara sugar big crystals of less refined sugar slivered almonds over here really pile on your toppings because the surface area is going to expand a lot in the oven plus not everything is gonna stick though i find it helps to push the nuts in a little bit for the powdered sugar on the chocolate just pile it on do not press it in if you press it it dissolves a little and it doesn't look very pretty whatever will stick will stick there we go kind of funny how at this stage they don't look at all like what they're going to become i've found 325 convection or 350 conventional works best that's like 160 or 180c and i'll bake them until they feel just firm enough to cut these have been in half an hour and they still feel soft and gooey at their centers after 45 minutes it's much better they shouldn't feel hard on the inside yet but they should be springy and pillowy at their center with a firm outer shell pull these out and i have the best results if i cut these as soon as possible as soon as they have cooled firm enough that i can lift them off the parchment without breaking them the softer they are the cleaner the cuts i get cutting at an angle just for pretty and set aside that end piece then basically cut these as thin as possible too thin and you'll crush the loaf with your knife too thick and they'll be hard to fit between your back teeth i'll lay those each onto the baking sheet as i go no need for grease or parchment or anything now they're baked they're not going to stick almond one next i tried doing this with a serrated knife i tried different knife strokes i find i get the cleanest cuts if i use my chef's knife but i wield it like a bread knife saw back and forth with almost no downward pressure until it catches and bites through that outer shell then i can push the knife down and through without crushing the loaf you can position these right next to each other on the pan they are not going to spread at all anymore gotta blast through this last one because it's cooling fast and firming up saw with minimal pressure until the knife bites through the brittle shell then push through the rest the firmer this cools the more brittle it becomes and that kind of thing starts happening oh well this whole recipe should fit onto one pan back in the oven these go to dry out and go crispy those end pieces are already crispy so you can occupy yourself with those while you wait how hard you bake these is up to you just remember that they're going to get a little firmer as they cool so i pull them when they feel just barely still soft in the center just a teeny bit of squish left those had an hour 15 total in the oven though i'm sure your results will vary go by feel not by the clock let them cool and steam out all the way and you can seal these up and keep them for a lot longer than other cookies surely that's why biscotti and rusk and other twice baked things were invented in the first place dry things last a long time and of course they have a satisfying crunch though the high butter content has ensured that these are still crumbly and will not shatter your teeth plus butter good use this recipe to clean out your baking drawer of random half bags and let's see what you come up with,3

My old video...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.186359, this video is sponsored by skillshare hi i'm adam ragusia and i'm going to show you how i shoot recipe videos here in my kitchen these are the kind of videos i post on youtube every thursday i've been doing this for a couple of years now and through many painful experiences i have found the first step must be a dry run of the recipe now even if i've taken my recipe through dozens of drafts and i'm really really happy with it i've got it really really refined i still have to do one dry run cooking it all the way through right before i shoot it to work out whether or not i have access to all of my tools that i might need and to think about my camera movements because like many people who do this i don't work with anybody else usually i shoot this food as i film the food at the same time one person banned there's actually almost a perfectly inverse relationship between the ease of shooting a recipe and the ease of cooking a recipe pretty much the easier our recipe is the harder it is to shoot because the easier recipes go by way faster caramelized onions are really easy to shoot because they take for freaking ever so i've got plenty of time to move my camera as i cook and get some nice shot variety something like pad thai goes by so fast at least in the actual cooking phase that it's virtually impossible for me to move the camera and the lights and reset the shots as i cook so for shooting a recipe that goes by really fast i have found that i have three basic strategies of coping with that one is to use multiple cameras set up a wide shot and a tight shot and then just leave the two cameras where they are switch between the two in the editing phase you're obviously seeing camera one via camera two right now another way is to shoot with one camera at a very high resolution you do this so that you can zoom in the editing phase which is what i'm doing right now on this camera you do this to simulate a two camera effect for reasons we'll get to later i prefer to work in this now passe hd video resolution in this particular aspect ratio that's going to be just 1920 pixels by 1080 pixels but in the case of this pizza shot i filmed in 4k that's 3840 by 2160 pixels i did this not because i planned to publish it in 4k but because i wanted to be able to zoom in post production without things looking too pixelated on the zoomed in shot like here let me shoot this orange on this camera in just plain old hd i'm going to zoom in by a hundred percent digitally you see how kind of fuzzy and pixelated that looks and now i'm going to shoot the same orange with 4k and then zoom in 100 and you can see that much nicer right so for this particular pizza shot i filmed with one camera in 4k because flipping and dressing the pizza on the oven grates is a very time sensitive operation i knew that i would not have time to reset the camera for shot variety so i shot in 4k so that i could make variety later in the editing phase the third option for filming a very quick cooking dish is to just use one camera but cook it and shoot it twice once from an angle like this and then once from maybe an angle like that in the case of that pad thai video i actually did both things i cooked it twice and i used two different cameras but whenever possible i try very hard to keep it a single camera shoot first and foremost so that i can use my best nicest camera and best nicest lens this is my a rig right here i am shooting myself right now on my b rig it's my b rig my second best camera this is my best camera this is the canon eos r5 it's a good camera but don't take that as an endorsement i work with canon cameras because i just happened to start on canons and i've invested a lot of money in canon lenses and frankly it's just kind of what i'm used to and i just don't have the brain space in my shooting schedule to adjust to a totally different camera system there's lots of really great cameras on the market don't think that like this is my secret it's not you might of course wonder why i'm using a little mirrorless digital camera instead of a real cinema camera this is the kind of thing that pros use to shoot a movie or a tv show and given the nature of my business here on youtube i could justify the expense well for one reason because i work solo it's very nice to have everything that i need contained in one little prosumer unit like this with a cinema camera you would often have it plugged into a big external monitor and big external controls here everything is in one place and that's useful for me plus a typical cinema camera is bad for me because it has fans and vents a cinema camera is built to record very very high quality video file formats huge amount of space these formats take up and to save down all of that data for every single still frame of the video you need really really powerful computing that generates a whole lot of heat and so you need a fan and a big vent to get that heat out and away from the electronics now a really high quality mirrorless or dslr camera like this can shoot those really hardcore file formats but not continuously because they don't have fans in vents and if they were to shoot for too long like that they would overheat and stuff would start melting that would be bad this particular camera the r5 is kind of notorious for having heat management problems though i've never really had any problems myself in part because i don't really shoot in those hardcore file formats i only ever shoot in like 8k or some such extreme thing for a shot like this where i'm using extreme high resolution as a form of microscopy it allows me to zoom in extremely tight in post production more pixels means more detail when you zoom in and i only do this kind of shot occasionally so i'm fine using a camera that does not have a fan and doesn't have a big vent on it and is therefore safer to use in proximity to things that splatter i shoot cooking so this gets splattered in water and sauce and grease all the time i don't always have time to really thoroughly wash my hands or dry them in between doing a cooking operation and needing to reset the camera so this thing is filthy by the time i am done shooting with it on a given day you want to hear something terrifying listen to the audio recorded by the camera's onboard mic during this shot you hear those low frequency thumps i believe each of those thumps is a droplet of grease directly striking the mike's diaphragm direct hit on the camera another reason i don't use a cinema camera is that i don't want to be worried about destroying this i mean if i broke this after like a year of use that would suck but it would totally have justified its existence right like it would have paid for itself over the vids that i made with it and i like being able to be relaxed about my gear my gear should serve me i should not serve it i feel that way about cooking gear i feel that way about filming gear now you might say why risk getting the camera so close to the food why not position it farther away well i want my recipe videos to be utilitarian first and foremost the job of the video is to make you feel like you've already cooked this once before so that when you go into the kitchen to make it yourself you have an intuitive almost tactile sense of how it's going to go i think i can best give people that sense through very tight shots that allow them to see the detail of how the food changes as it cooks plus i know from my analytics that most people watching are watching on phone screens so i frame my shots for phone screens sometimes when i watch my stuff later on big screens the shots look very tight and kind of claustrophobic to me but then i watch it again on a little screen and it fits it feels right and if you want to communicate any kind of detail via a small screen then the shot has to be really really tight otherwise the object is just going to be too small now of course you can still get very very tight very close-up shots by using a much longer lens zooming in really tight from further away but for optical physics reasons that i still kind of struggle to understand longer focal lengths compress the perspective of images in ways that kind of flatten out a lot of the detail that i'm looking for when i'm shooting a recipe whenever possible this is the lens that i use it is a 35 millimeter macro lens macro means it's a lens that's designed to focus on things that are physically very very close to it like look at my finger there so close so in focus there's also a slight magnifying effect with a lens like this 1.5 magnification factor it's also a prime lens meaning it cannot zoom in and out as the expression goes you zoom with your feet zoom with your feet this might seem less convenient and indeed perhaps it is but prime lenses are usually sharper and clearer than zoom lenses for various reasons the glass is just better and it just gets me more of that detail that sharpness that i'm again looking for for utilitarian purposes to show you detail on the food to inform you on how it's gonna go when you try to cook it and to illuminate detail you need light for various reasons cameras need way more light than your eyes do and here is the lighting setup that i've arrived at for what it's worth lighting way way way more important to the look of a video than the camera or even the lens that you're using in my opinion so this is what i've got i've evolved to using a three-point lighting setup i've got a soft box over here on one side of the food a soft box over there on the other side of the food and then i have this ring light on top ring light see ring light i used to just use the ring light because i was working a full-time job when i first started making recipe videos and my young children were even younger so what i wanted was a setup that's all on one stick because the thing about ring lights is you take the camera and then you can put it onto this l bracket that's up here and now everything is contained all on one unit i sort of designed this thing i even had a little external monitor and external mic and everything all kind of bracketed to this all on one piece of equipment that i could then fold up and stick it to a corner completely assembled when i was done shooting i called it the culinary tron yes that's an errol morris joke and anyway it wasn't really great problem was back then i did not understand the importance of shadows beauty youtubers and the like love ring lights because they eliminate shadow the camera is inside the light and as a result the light is moving parallel to the camera's point of view shadows happen when light comes perpendicular to the camera's point of view the light comes down and is blocked by an object that then casts a shadow from the camera's point of view here the light and the camera are moving parallel and as a result no shadows and no shadows to illuminate fine details in the texture of the object being filmed fine details like fine lines and blemishes they're just sand blasted off by a ring light like this thank you honey for holding it so obscuring fine textural details is great when you're trying to take 10 years off your face it's bad when you are trying to show detail in food this is the kind of thing they would teach you about in any introductory filmmaking textbook or class but because i like many people am autodidactic to a fault i just have to learn things myself my own way the hard way and i had to learn this shadow thing the hard way you can actually see me discover it in the tandoori chicken video that i made a year and a half ago i shot the whole thing with the camera inside the ring light no shadows then i took the camera out to change the battery and i thought wow that looks great the light was hitting the food perpendicular to the camera's angle of view casting shadows and heightening contrast making fine detail more visible so nowadays i like to use the ring light directly above the food like this but i usually take the camera out and i am shooting stuff more from the side however sometimes i still do put this up here into the l bracket because i like the way the ring light casts a weird unnatural glow into circular reflective objects like pans or plates the light comes down into the pan and it reflects off of the sides and into the food making the food glow in this really cool way i first noticed this effect when i made a mac and cheese video with my dad a couple of years ago this has some of my worst videography in it but i loved this shot with the camera inside the ring light pointed right into the stainless steel pot the light gets inside the pot the pot bounces it inward and everything inside glows i love how this looks and i still do it sometimes even though i don't need to keep my entire camera set up on one stick anymore i'm hardly the first person to observe that your constraints can lead you into creative territory that you otherwise might not have ever ventured into your constraints are what make you different they won't make you creative your constraints are great embrace them anyway so i usually film with the camera down to the side of the food to the side of the ring lights direction these days and that means that i very often need to direct light into the side of food let me turn this light off a little too much shadow so that's where this two softbox setup came from softbox is just a light that is kind of inside a big fabric bag that diffuses it makes it bounce around in a few different directions and softens it get a nice soft glow instead of a really harsh glare i have two one over here to light to the side of the food down here and then i have one behind the food to kind of backlight it which will kind of make the top edge of it glow a little bit as long as the backlight isn't too strong if the backlight is too strong you will silhouette the object i also use the backlight for this particular shot where i'm filming stuff that's in the pan from a very very very low angle and what this does is it causes the light from the backlight to kind of skip really directly off the surface the wet surface in the pan like a rock skipping off a pond before it bounces into the camera and this creates a really really dramatic reflection that i think looks really sexy plus it again just illuminates detail heightens contrast allowing you to see more and learn more now addition to these three lights i of course also use just like the normal lights that are in my kitchen and i use the sun i figured out a long time ago that my stuff looked a whole lot better if i filmed in the daylight when there is blue light from a bright blue sky coming into the kitchen and supplementing the more yellow light that i get from my studio lights now you can simulate that effect by blending colors within a light blending both warm and cool colors with your light i know that's what professional like lighting techs do but for what it's worth that just never worked as well for me and got me prettier colors than when i just shoot during the daytime sometimes i'm forced to shoot at night or on a cloudy day like this video i had to shoot on a cloudy day and the colors just look like crap the colors on a day like today with the sun shining blue light mixed with the yellow light really nice colors one last note on color most pro videographers these days do what's called shooting flat or using a logarithmic color profile basically these are file formats that are huge they take up a ton of space and they capture tons more color information this gives you wider dynamic range more detail in very dark or very bright images and it gives you more latitude in post-production to grade or correct the colors i've messed with this a lot and whenever possible i try to not shoot flat i shoot in the normal mp4 file format that people use on consumer grade gear and when i do that i have to get the shot looking good inside the camera as i am shooting it because i have much less wiggle room when i am editing later much less wiggle room to change the colors and the brightness i found it works better for me to just get it looking good in the camera because i publish two times a week and i work alone i try to be very economical in my process as a result smaller file sizes hd mp4s are easier and quicker for my computer to chug on more importantly if i force myself to make my shots look good in the camera as i am shooting them instead of thinking i'll just fix the colors in the exposure later in post then i force myself to quickly make decisions commit to them and move on when i was a much younger man i thought that i was lazy because i procrastinated a lot and then i realized as i got older that in fact i'm not particularly lazy or at least the laziness isn't the problem the problem is my perfectionism and my anxiety right if given the option to delay making a consequential decision i absolutely will and that is when i dither so the more that i can lock myself into decisions as i go the better another way that i try to shoot for the edit as they say is to integrate motion food is inanimate it just sits there it doesn't have a whole lot of natural motion and motion is good it makes videos more dynamic as they say just more interesting to watch motion is also good because it helps you make smoother edits one of the easiest ways to make a smooth feeling edit between two different shots is to cut to action is what it's called this is another one of these things that i'm sure they cover in an introductory editing text but i had to figure it out for myself watch as i cut from a wide angle to a tight angle without any motion do you see how abrupt that felt now this should get a little bit smoother if i integrate some motion see that you cut right on something moving as opposed to cutting onto something that's just sitting still so as i'm shooting i try to leave myself lots of moving things to edit with later even if it's something as dumb as just me pointing at the food one more time here's that cut with no emotion pretty abrupt pretty jumpy as they say a jump cut here's that cut again with some motion even if it's just my stupid finger some even better motion would be spooning sauce over food this is also good because wet food only glistens like that for a few seconds as it sits the surface dries and reflects less light for whatever reason i find cameras really amplified this effect so i often have to re-wet the surface of something before i can get a good shot of it gotta fluff up the noodles until they glisten again another very economical way to create motion in still life videography is focus effects drawing the focus from the front of the frame to the back of the frame or vice versa i know i overuse this but man it just works so well and it's so easy it creates movement it helps you direct the viewer's attention from one part of the food to another and it enhances our perception of detail because it's blurring out all the distracting stuff that you're not supposed to be looking at i also use that rack focus effect a lot with a shot that i call the lean this is when i want to get a nice shot from a little bit higher up of the finished plate of food gotta plate the food move the ring light over on top of it i'm gonna show you this maneuver i call the lean take the camera pick it up point it at the wall to get the focus really messed up then point it back down at the food and as it refocuses pull the camera really close to my body and lean show that again take the camera pull it really close to my body and then just lean i do this right i get that focal movement simultaneous with the orbital movement of the camera moving as i lean past it or rotate around it it doesn't look great at first but when i apply stabilization software to it in premiere it looks freaking great so let's talk about stability when shooting recipe videos specifically i almost never use this motorized gimbal stabilizer that i use for other things this thing works really well for other stuff but not for recipes i don't use dollies no dolly tracks i don't use jibs i use none of that these things are great for kind of filming things that are kind of in the middle distance or far away but they're terrible at doing close-ups here let me show you right see i'm doing a really tight shot on an object there and see how i'm still kind of wobbling around a little bit that movement is inherent in any kind of handheld gimbal but you just don't see it when you're much further away from the object the movement is amplified by being very close to it and remember when i'm shooting recipe content i'm doing really tight shots like this one time i did this cake video with my friend and i was shooting with a gimbal just to kind of save her time so that i could move a little bit faster around her and all the shots were super wobbly it was really hard to edit around and i just swore never again to use this for shooting recipes so now the only stabilizers i use are tripods which are easy to get the camera in and out of if you have a quick release plate like this really nice and sometimes i don't even use the tripod sometimes i use a can of tomatoes love this and it's great with this is called a z head that i'm using here that's a really really great little cheap thing for filming anything that's kind of down on a table you can get a really really good angle adjustment on it really quickly with a z head recommend the other stabilizer that i use of course is my own body if i'm just holding the camera this camera is light so it doesn't have much inertia it is easily set in and out of motion that's why it's so darn wobbly if i tuck it into my body like this really kind of tight and i effectively add my mass of my body to the inertia of this camera then everything moves a lot more smoothly and that's why one of the reasons why the lean works so well just tuck the camera to my chest there and then just lean as far as i can until i fall over like a dork i usually cut away before that happens and of course some of my shots are just shaky and ugly and i've learned to live with that my philosophy of shooting food is the same as my philosophy of cooking food if there's a quick and easy way for me to make my food pretty i'm totally going to do it but if it's going to add a whole lot of time and effort to the process and or if it's going to compromise either the taste or the nutrition of the food then nah i'm not going to do that the primary function of home cooking is to efficiently deliver you something that is tasty and nourishing if it's pretty that's a bonus likewise the primary function of a food video is to help you learn how to cook if i can get a sexy super smooth parallax shot bonus points but sometimes i just have to grab the camera with my hand and shove it in the oven so that you can see the thing that you need to see and so that i can make my videos more quickly the faster i can shoot the more videos i can make the more content for you the more money for my family win win win right the last way in which i try to shoot for the edit and save myself a little bit of time work more efficiently is that i try to think about my script as i am shooting my voiceover script if i know i'm going to need to explain a few things about this sugar i'm gonna pour that sugar out of my spoon as slowly as possible to buy myself some time to talk over likewise if i know that i have hardly anything to say about cutting up this vegetable i just leave the camera in one place and blast through the job because there's no point in shooting a bunch of alternate angles that i'm not going to use because i have nothing to say about this vegetable then i dump all my footage into the computer and i scrub through it as i write my script so that i know exactly what i'm going to be talking over i have a whole video about my writing process if you're curious about that it's linked in the description then i take my mic and my recorder and i go into the closet radio men and women have done the coat closet trick for decades though we didn't always have self-illuminating screens from which to read our scripts very nice closets are super tight spaces with lots of soft surfaces if there's coats in them these surfaces will diffuse the sound closet over there keeps the sound from bouncing around and creating a whole bunch of ugly sounding reflections like i get when i have to appear on camera and therefore shoot here in my kitchen that has a whole bunch of smooth surfaces and reflects sound a whole lot i just kind of have to live with this here when i'm not on camera i go in the closet then i come out of the closet and it's time to edit which is a process that i'll show you another day if you found this video useful please do not take any of the tips that i have given you today as industry best practices i don't know what i'm doing i came from radio i started making

Free shipping within the United...,2022-12-01 14:47:05.186359, caramelized onions are delicious on pizza but they tend to burn one solution don't use them as a topping use them as a sauce and then if you want you can tweak the other flavors to give yourself a french onion soup inspired pizza it's way better than it sounds first thing is to peel and chop some garlic i tried it without garlic and it didn't taste quite enough like pizza the garlic makes it taste like pizza set aside one big onion will only give you enough sauce for one pizza because it's gonna cook down a lot i've got a sweet onion a vidalia but you could use any onion and there's no shame in adding some sugar to it once you've got it cooked down normally people do like thin slices or wedges for caramelized onions but those would be slimy and messy as a pizza sauce they'd sliver out onto your lip i'm dicing this basically as fine as i can to me this dice gets you the perfect middle ground between long ribbons and a smooth puree i tried the puree too and it was just like baby food a wide pan on high heat all the way high a little oil and in they go stir non-stop yes caramelized onions have to cook kind of slowly otherwise parts of them will burn before the rest turn soft and amber but with this much fresh onion in the pan the cooking is gonna be slow no matter how high your heat is there's just so much water to evaporate i find as long as i keep my onions moving constantly high heat is a-okay at least in the beginning phases we're coming up on like five minutes now and you can start to see a little brown forming around the edge of some pieces and a little brown fond building on the bottom of the pan at this point you can either turn down the heat and keep going more slowly or you can deglaze just a little bit just enough to release brown stuff from the pan and to rehydrate those edges of the pieces before they burn you do it this way and you can keep going at high heat all the way to the end stir until you're afraid it's going to burn deglaze a little some more you could use plain water yeah i'm using white wine i also tried this with beef stock to double down on the french onion soup theme that was a little much for me the pizza really tasted like soup but it was good i kind of wish i'd done half water or stock and half white wine all white wine like i did this time was a little strong for me at the end though if you didn't use any wine i'd suggest a little splash of vinegar at the end it's a pizza sauce it needs some acidity when all the pieces are silky and amber colored you're done because we started with a fine dice and used high heat in a wide pan this only took 15 minutes caramelized onions often take two or three times as much time i'm going to turn off my heat throw in my garlic and just cook it for a couple of minutes i want it to be pretty fresh tasting this is when i might add a pinch of sugar if i wasn't using a sweet onion by the way or maybe some balsamic vinegar and a little more liquid just to make sure i have a saucy spreadable consistency for the pizza pizza dough my standard recipe it's in the description with a wet dough like this i like

using my method where i grill it directly on my oven grates i have found an easier way to do this i'm going to show you right now a great position near the top element and i will turn on my broiler aka grill full blast right before i start shaping my dough that's all the preheat time a broiler needs for this method you've got to roll the pizza out tossing does not work it's got to be pretty uniform in thickness all over roll that wider than you want it because it's going to snap back a bit and where i used to avoid flouring my dough while shaping this time i'm flowering it quite liberally especially right at the end because what i'm going to do is roll this gently around the tip of my rolling pin don't want it to stick to itself do it gently now instead of flinging the dough over the hot grates i can simply place it down and unroll it like a scroll so much easier make sure the ends aren't drooping down too far hook them around the grates remember the grates are hot under the broiler this goes close the oven up and you just blast side one until brown if you get big bubbles like that i recommend popping them with your tongs the flour insulates the dough a little bit so you might not get super dramatic color but you also get some toasted flour flavor a little burning on the bottom of pizza is desirable i think flip that over with your tongs and this is the side we're gonna top here's our minced caramelized onions as with any pizza sauce a little goes a long way this is a thin food if i feel i don't have quite enough sauce then i usually have it exactly right a heavy scattering of parmesan really helps to make this taste like pizza than my melting cheese i'm using a blend this is gruyere which is what you traditionally melt on french onion soup i tried using only this great flavor but it splits really bad at pizza baking temperatures it squeezes out all its grease i got much better results when i blended it with my favorite mozzarella for pizza which is this brand of whole milk low moisture string cheese you'd want to get at least eight ounces like a quarter kilo grated or chopped up for a pizza this size you might not use it all but you'd want it handy just in case slide that back under the top element closer up and cook until melty brown to your liking this is just such an effective method for getting crispy browned pizza without any special equipment i really believe in it but you could of course bake this recipe on a pizza stone or some such pull that out straight to a cooling rack this will keep the bottom dry while the pizza cools i picked some fresh thyme earlier i'll scatter that across and let it cook a little in the residual heat tarragon would also go nice with the onions but you could go with a standard pizza herb like basil using a lot of flour on the dough also reduces the unnervingly smooth skin like texture that i used to get on the bottom of the pizza using the oven grate method now it's more of a traditional slightly powdery texture and i love the texture of the onions in that caramelizing onions doesn't just get you sweetness it gives you this silky mouth feel i gotta say that flavor combination is pretty dynamite credit goes to my wife lauren i was talking about wanting to make an onion pizza and she was like french onion soup pizza and i was like really but now i'm like yeah really,3
Why are sweet onions sweet? Can you really eat Vidalia onions like apples?,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M2GIXU_WFC0/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLBxKMGRVKdiUqlLcwoQowOux7jIEg,M2GIXU_WFC0,"15 minutes, 44 seconds","Thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this video!

and this onion is special says science says the law this is one of very few food products here in the united states that enjoys anything remotely like a european style designation of origin like the eu and its member nations have a long legal tradition of saying for example any chi sold as feta has to be made this certain way and only in these regions of greece you can make it elsewhere but you can't call it feta we don't really do that in the states and when we do it's some very broad statewide trademark like idaho potatoes this this is different the u.s code of federal regulation says that onion has to be one of a few certain varieties and it has to be grown in one of 20 counties clustered around the little georgia city of vidalia people who live there might say it more like vidaya for me i think that sounds like i'm affecting a southern accent a little too hard i'm going with vidalia which is a lot closer than vidalia growing up in the north i think people usually said it vidalia but the fact that the name was on their lips at all tells you something right vidalia onions are famous for being very sweet sweet isn't like sugar sweet yeah but also sweet as in not hot not pungent not accurate not frying off the mucous membranes in your nose and your eyes not stinking up the whole house and your breath also there's payments for being kind of juicy too people say you can just pick them up and eat them like apples is that true find out in a minute first we gotta plant them because the secret is in the dirt at least partially in the dirt here we are at a m farms outside lions georgia the a stands for this fella ares haygood yeah we grow by the onions see what i mean vidalia well right now what you see is us planting our seed that's what the tractors there are doing the machines that they pull punch a tiny hole into the ground and drop an individual seed at exactly the perfect depth at exactly the perfect distance from the other seeds and let's talk about the seeds probably the first and foremost factor that makes an onion a sweet onion is the variety that you're growing vidalias are yellow onion varieties that likely originated with mediterranean farmers that's why they're good for hot climates european colonists brought these onions first to bermuda and to this day some people refer to all sweet and or yellow onions as bermuda onions from there they were introduced to the american southeast the standard vidalia these days is a hybrid of the texas early grano 951c and the yb986 which in turn was descended from the excel grano plus excel equals gronix most vidalia onions are the yellow gronix variety the seeds of which you can buy online and plant pretty much anywhere and they will be kind of sweet onions however in the 1930s a farmer outside vidalia georgia named mose coleman tried planting onions and we tasted them he noticed that they were really sweet like bizarrely sweet as the legend goes coleman met with a produce buyer for a grocery chain he pulled out one of his onions and he ate it raw right in front of the guy to demonstrate that it would not make him cry hey why do onions make you cry believe it or not the process was not fully explained until japanese scientists figured it out in this 2002 paper when onion cells are damaged an enzyme called alanis comes into contact with water and a sulfur compound in the onion called s1 propanol l-cysteine sulfoxide these react to create one propanol sulfenic acid which in turn reacts with a different enzyme called lacrimatory factor synthesis to make propenethyls oxide which is basically tear gas it's a defense mechanism the onion does not want to be eaten it is not an apple an apple tree wants you to eat this so that you will swallow the seeds that are in here and then you will go off and deposit those seeds elsewhere where they can grow into a new tree you are part of the trees reproductive process how romantic the onion plant has other ways of spreading its seeds as we shall soon see other ways that do not involve you and me the onion bulb itself is the plant's energy storage center that's why it's full of carbs sugars the plant doesn't want you to steal those carbs for yourself so when damaged by the teeth of some critter the onion gasses you like a riot cop you are ordered to disperse and all those pungent acrid substances that we encounter in onions have one thing in common and that is the chemical element sulfur the soil down in the vidalia region is very very low in sulfur because geography is destiny the region is smack dab in the atlantic coastal plain where rivers falling down from the adjacent uplands deposited silts over millions of years and witnessed the results well as you can see the dirt is uh is sandier so the water kind of infiltrates and and just sinks on down when it does that it tends to flush the sulfur content down also with it and this is called leaching the rain falls down onto that soil the water dissolves the sulfur and carries the sulfur down as it percolates through that sandy soil down down down deep below and then the surface layers of soil just have a lot less sulfur in them this produces milder onions that particular dirt in the vidalia region is like bizarrely low in sulfur to the point where the university of georgia agricultural extension recommends that vidalia farmers add some sulfur back in with fertilizers the science i'm giving you today is from their onion growing guide the extension sulfur is an essential macronutrient for all plants they need at least some of it to grow and these onions planted in september have grown to what is called the flag leaf stage basically when they look like little blades of grass then we'll come back in about 60 days and we will pull each onion out by hand and then we'll go and plant it by hand in the fields that we're going to transplant them into so here we are in november and see what those guys are throwing out of the back of that truck those are the onions little bundles of adolescent onion plants plucked out of that first field that we visited that's aries in the tractor tilling the ground and mechanically punching holes into which a human hand deposits each and every onion whose hands are these well these guys are what is known as an h2a crew the h2a is a visa granted by the united states to temporary agricultural workers like 90 of whom live the rest of the year in northern mexico where their economic opportunities may be relatively poor typically it's third party contractors that assemble the cruise and bus them up to farms to do these kinds of tasks ares only needs dozens of human hands for a few weeks a year it wouldn't make any sense for him to permanently employ a huge crew and of course it's not just onions if you eat any food in the u.s there's a really good chance an immigrant had a hand in bringing that food to your table and that hand probably performed some physically demanding and repetitive task like this one we should acknowledge here that guest worker programs are very very common in rich countries all over the world not just the united states and of course they are prone to exploitation and abuse that's an important thing that we're going to talk about another day what i will say now is that many farmers try to hide immigrant labor from people like me with cameras and by extension hide this system of labor from you in contrast ares invited me on his farm many times over the whole growing season he did not assign me a handler he let me loose to film anything i want and i think that counts for something but of course another thing you're probably wondering right now is why bother why bother transplanting the onions why not just let them keep growing in the field that you initially planted them in well you can do that but a lot of onions are grown from transplants up north you might do this so that you can start the onions inside in a greenhouse it's too cold for them outside in the winter up there then you can transplant them from the nursery out into the fields when it warms up in the springtime down here in the sweltering vidalia region onions can grow outside all through the winter the primary reason they transplant them from one field another is weed control transplanting allows them to start fresh halfway through the process with newly tilled weed free dirt and to drop in plants that are already big and strong and are going to have an easier time out competing any little weeds that do come along this is a non-herbicidal weed control system you're looking at and then from here on out the growing process is a whole lot less manual this here is what is known as a center pivot irrigation system it's why crops in flat areas look like circles or semicircles from up in an airplane the water comes up from there and a gigantic radiating arm just slowly rolls in a big arc sprinkling everything down onions are mostly water they need a lot of water to grow and that sandy soil leeches rain water like crazy modern irrigation systems can compensate for this and i've talked to lots of farmers down here who actually prefer it this way it's kind of like cooking it's easy to add water but it's hard to take water away and if the soil is too wet that's really bad too so farmers here really like having well-drained soil that they can irrigate as needed and then before you know it it's april and time to dig the onions harvest the onions that's what that tractor is getting ready to do down there but today i'm going to be digging some myself by hand the onion has used its green leaves to gather solar energy and store that energy as sugar in its bulb and when the bulb is full grown the greens start to die and fall over when they just start to fall over that means the onion is ready over in this field we see something a little bit different these onions have bolted that is they have prematurely sent up a flowering stock out in the wild when they're not being farmed for food onions naturally have a two year life cycle their first spring they send up those green leaves that collect a whole bunch of energy from the sun they store that energy as sugar in the bulb and then the greens die off the bulb just kind of sits in the dirt over the winter and waits then in its next year it's next spring it sends up that stalk with a flower at the end that blooms and it sends off seeds and there you have your next generation of onions that have their own two-year life cycle and repeat now we had a pretty cool spring here in georgia this year so that's probably what tricked these onions into bolting early when this happens the bulb stops growing because the energy is going to the flower now right luckily these were pretty much done growing when they bolted so they're fine they're great actually check out this monster i wanted to see what the flower would look like when it bloomed so i kept it alive in a bucket of water and here we go check it out the seeds then come from there and scatter on the wind or maybe on the side of an animal that brushes by that's why onions do not need or want me to eat them well too bad can you really eat sweet onions like apples i mean you can if you're into that it still tastes like an onion still has some pungency i would want it to have some pungency that is very sugary too and it's super juicy sweet onion varieties tend to hold a lot more water which makes them harder to store for a long time and transport long distances as a result sweet onions are still regarded as local ephemeral treats in their growing regions vidalia's in georgia texas suites walla wallas from washington state maui suites from hawaii all highly local seasonal delights the advent of controlled atmosphere storage has helped in recent decades you can hold onions for a pretty long time in a low oxygen high carbon dioxide refrigerated environment you can also just buy them straight from the farm these days thanks to the miracle of modern parcel services there's a link in the description where you can order some of aries onions here he's not paying me to say that i mean i suppose he gave me these onions but this is not a sponsored message or anything i'm just grateful that a m let me shoot an entire cycle of a crop that's a pretty cool opportunity for me anyway say you buy yourself some vidalias or other precious sweet onions before they inevitably sell out for the season what do you do with them well an obvious idea would be to caramelize them they've got a ton of sugar so they will go particularly sweet with long slow cooking that both drives off the diluting moisture and diffuses what little sulfur compounds are in here heat deactivates the enzymes that make that tear gas historically long cooking of onions would have been one of the cheapest ways to get sugar into savory dishes think of indian curries so many of them are traditionally built on a foundation of slowly concentrated onion sugar it's got to go slower it's going to burn nowadays with refined sugar being so plentiful and available i'm not sure that i really see as much of an importance in cooking down your sugars from an onion it's sucrose whether it comes from an onion or it comes from you know your sugar bowl i think the main value of a sweet onion these days is in recipes that call for raw or nearly raw onions they're amazing as toppings for burgers and other sandwiches or in a salad i love tomato and vidalia onion salad in the early summer really good thing to have you get all that crunch and freshness of raw onion without just blasting yourself in onion's stank or you can do what our friend ares does he chops up big chunks of onion and puts them in a rip roaring hot pan and just kind of start to brown them a little bit still crunchy then i'll put a little bit of butter and garlic powder and a little bit of salt and some

***RECIPE, SERVES 2***

1 large...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.186359, chicken piccata is generally a chicken breast flattened out floured and fried with a pan sauce based on lemon butter parsley and sometimes capers the capers are the best part imho rather than having it with pasta i figured out a good way of doing it with little faux noodles of asparagus asparagus is amazing with these flavors anyway and we save some calories here that we can spend on more butter first thing is to peel and chop a few garlic cloves and a couple of shallots or one big one like this roughly chop i like to see some big chunkies in the sauce and the garlic will be less likely to burn if it isn't super fine push that to the side a standard one pound bunch of asparagus the king of all green vegetables in my book and you don't want any of that woody part of the stem for this i'm feeling some resistance there so i'm going to trim even higher up these are not terribly fresh unfortunately here's the best slicing method i've found slice one very thin noodle off the asparagus and now it has a flat surface that you can roll it onto super stable and from here i can get three more super thin slices if you have thicker asparagus obviously you can get more than that a little slice off the side roller and nice and stable three more slices as thin as i can get them this is a little painstaking but it's the only time consuming part of this recipe and you certainly don't have to be perfect with each cut done and while we're here i'll slice my lemon in half time for the chicken one big breast like that should be enough for two people i'm making two portions gotta get it thinner and you could slice it into several thin medallions but today i'm slicing the whole thing vertically in half i just do that with my head down low on the counter so i can see from the side if i'm getting it even not bad i don't think you need to pound it super flat like a schnitzel really just the thick part at the top so it'll cook more evenly with the thin tail yes i'm pounding this with a pint glass that works fine the force that it would take to shatter this against the meat would also send meat flying across the room you're just not gonna do it okay i'll get my widest pan a generous coating of olive oil in there and heat on medium and i'll get everything else handy because once we start this is going to go super quick i like some chili flake and capers i like these big ones from spain and then you'll need a fork to reach in and lift them out of their brine gotta have some butter handy for the sauce and a knife to cut it with and water some people use chicken stock i think water is fine actually let me move all of that away because this chicken gonna splatter enough pepper and salt for both sides of the chicken and then a little handful of flour tossed that around and now i only have to wash my hand once and if you don't want the carbs you could skip the flour or you could use almond flour that works great just use a little lower heat or make some room in your daily carb budget by eating the sponsor of this video for breakfast magic spoon cereal let's thank them real quick magic spoon has the exact same flavor as

description and use my code ragusia for five dollars off they ship to canada now too magicspoon.com ragusa for five bucks off your box thank you magic spoon now lay that chicken in the hot oil bigger piece first there's always a slightly bigger piece if you're nervous about sticking you can kind of slide it around for the first few seconds some people straight up breadcrumb and deep fried chicken piccata i think that just turns it into a schnitzel that little bit of flour just enhances browning and clings better to the sauce later whoops my heat is a little bit too high i'll knock that back a little bit got to make sure i don't burn any of the fond at the bottom of the pan because we're making a pan sauce in here in a minute i'm looking for these to hit 160 fahrenheit 70c in the thick part there it'll cook the rest of the way while it sits on the board the thicker one needed a few more seconds that was about six minutes total and now in goes the garlic shallots and asparagus i'm doing my vegetable side and my sauce at exactly the same time and i'll give them as much dry heat as i can before i'm worried that either the garlic or the fond is going to burn and at that point i'll deglaze with water and turn the heat up to high once the pan is wet nothing can burn as long as you keep moving everything got to keep the asparagus moving to cook it evenly and if the pan is ever looking dry more water again people use stock you can do that now i can start dropping in my other ingredients my capers between the salt and the chicken and the brine that's still clinging to these capers i'm probably not going to need any more salt in the dish some chili flake highly optional stir stir gotta keep the asparagus rotating around and then the lemon juice just passing it through my fingers to catch any seeds you might start with half a lemon for two portions i'm doing the whole lemon because well you know you can always squeeze more at the table alrighty when the asparagus is just starting to look floppy and noodly it's time to turn the heat off the bubbling has to pretty much stop before we can put in the butter a little more water there i got to make more sauce than it seems like we need because the sauce is for the asparagus and for the chicken drop in as much butter as your belief system will permit and stir to emulsify you should see the sauce noticeably thicken if it doesn't add more butter i'll taste for seasoning yeah no more salt but then again i was also using salted butter now this is important rather than dumping the asparagus onto the plate i'm lifting it out i want to leave most of the sauce behind in the pan that's looking a little army green but don't stress we're going to fix that by returning the pan to the warm burner and tearing in a whole ton of parsley nice bright green if you want to pre-slice your chicken now would be a great time and you can lift that onto the veg and coat everything in sauce that's nice but i think my sauce is a little runny more butter yeah that's what i'm talking about super glossy the magic emulsifying power of butter pequent i believe is the perfect word to describe that sauce though i have no idea how to pronounce it picant quint picante no idea but this good,3

And why do
professional cooks favor it so heavily, at least American professional cooks? In much
of the rest of the world, y'all have barely even heard of this stuff. My fellow Americans,
go to a U.K. grocery chain's website and look for kosher salt. Waitrose has a million kinds
of salt, no kosher salt — or at least nothing labeled as kosher salt. That's an important
distinction because kosher salt is really just a name. It's a name for a very broad
category of salts — coarse, flaky crystals of sodium chloride. Look at these salts under
the microscope. This one is marketed as kosher salt, this one is marketed as kosher salt,
and this one is kosher salt plus clearly a lot of other trace minerals. These salts have
nothing in common, except that they're all big and flaky and sold as kosher salt. To understand how we came to refer to something
like this as kosher salt, we must first understand this country's special relationship with two
isms: industrialism and Judaism. People of Jewish faith and/or heritage account for only
about 4% of the U.S. population, yet more Jews live in the United States than in the
whole rest of the world combined, minus Israel. It's been that way since World War II and
the Holocaust. Kosher is the English and Yiddish variant of the Hebrew word kasher, meaning
correct or appropriate or fit. In the case of food, fit for consumption. If food is kosher,
that means it complies with Kashrut, the somewhat elaborate body of Jewish dietary laws. The
minutia of Kashrut is debatable and debated among Jews, but one highly cited authority
is the Orthodox Union, a kosher certification agency in New York. OU says this Morton table salt is not kosher
for a few reasons, one being it contains iodine. Iodine is a chemical additive that a century
ago helped to eradicate the epidemic of goiter that happened all across the far northern
United States. I have a whole episode about that in the description. Orthodox Union considers
Morton Kosher to be kosher, but here's the thing — the kosher in kosher salt doesn't
really refer to the salt itself being kosher, though it may also be kosher. The real reason
a salt like this is called kosher salt is that big flaky salts are what you use for
koshering meat — rendering meat fit for consumption under Jewish dietary laws. Big
flaky salts are used for that, which is why we call them kosher salts. They're more accurately
called koshering salts or kashering salts. Lots of verses in the Torah forbid the eating
of blood, and so lots of rules around the consumption of animals are geared toward minimizing
residual blood that's left in the meat. This is probably one of the historical origins
of meat slaughtering practices in both Judaism and in Islam — practices that are geared
toward minimizing the emotional stress on the animal. When animals are really freaked
out right before slaughter, their blood doesn't drain as thoroughly. The modern meat industry
refers to this as fiery carcass. A properly slaughtered animal will have hardly any blood
left in it after it's been drained. Blood just falls out of an open circulatory system. The heavy salting of meats called for in Jewish
dietary law is intended to draw out any remaining residual blood, or perhaps things that people
mistake for blood. Like, as I open up these lamb chops, that ain't blood. That is myoglobin.
That's the pink protein-laden liquid found inside all muscle tissue. When meat is juicy,
that's the juice. Myoglobin is very similar to hemoglobin, which is the stuff that makes
blood red. But they're still just not the same thing, and if you have a problem with
eating myoglobin, then you have a problem with eating meat, because all meat is literally
full of myoglobin. That is the juice. You may still see a bit of actual blood inside
major vessels. Kosher butchers will cut those out. The blood we see here is coming from
the cut bones. Red blood cells — those are made in the marrow. Anyway, according to this set of procedures
that I'm following from chabad.org, first we wash the meat thoroughly by hand. Then
we soak the meat in clean, room-temperature water for at least half an hour and no more
than a day. Then we wash it again and dry it. Now, we thoroughly coat the meat in salt
and let it sit for at least one hour and no more than 12 hours. It is commonly believed
that big flakes of salt will stick better to the meat and dissolve at the rate optimal
for drawing out the ""blood."" I've actually got six lamb chops on this board. After washing
and drying, I will weigh them them all. Then these two, I will kosher with kosher salt.
These two, I will kosher with table salt. These two, I won't salt at all. The salt draws
water out of the meat by osmosis. You can see that happening right there. Interestingly, early on, there's more stuff
pooling around the chops that I coated in table salt, perhaps because the smaller grains
dissolved more quickly. So, Is that blood? Well, it's water, plus maybe some other little
molecules, other micro substances small enough to pass through the semi-permeable membranes
of those meat cells. I suppose that maybe a little bit of that is coming from tiny little
pockets of blood that are still residually in there? The interesting thing is, the minimal
hour that koshering demands is totally enough time for this salty solution to diffuse back
into the tissue. Chefs of all faiths do this for the express purpose of getting salt inside
the meat. It's called dry brining. I'll follow the rest of the koshering procedure. We rinse the meat three times. The first time
under running water, which the public health community says you really shouldn't do. It
can spray pathogenic bacteria around the kitchen. I suppose food safety guidelines are their
own kind of orthodoxy. Anyway, the meat is washed and dried. It is koshered. I'm just
curious, I'm going to weigh them all again. The meat we koshered weighs almost exactly
the same as it did before, but that doesn't mean nothing happened. No, we certainly got
some stuff out of that meat. If we hadn't, the meat would now weigh more than it did
before, because now it has a bunch of salt inside it that it didn't have before. I'm
more interested to note that the kosher salt and the table salt seemed to have the same
net effect in terms of weight. Let's cook these and weigh them again. The
reason that chefs dry brine for totally secular reasons is it changes the protein structure.
It allows the meat to retain more moisture during cooking. The ones we didn't kosher
lost about a third of their weight in the oven. The ones we did kosher lost only about
a quarter of their weight. Again, same effect with the kosher salt versus the table salt
in terms of weights. They both taste equally salty to me. I wonder if we'd get different
results if we didn't leave the meat brining on the board in a puddle of its own juices.
I've got a couple of bone-in chicken breasts, kosher salt on one, table salt on the other,
and let's hang those so that some of the liquid can drain away. Rinse, dry, and they lost
a couple of grams. But again, no difference between the two salt types, even when cooked.
They even tasted the same to me. Nonetheless, my experience just now koshering
meat totally convinced me that kosher salt is far superior for the job. I'm going to
tell you why. Big flaky salt is far superior for any kind of dry brining, for pretty much
any kind of cooking, whether in a professional kitchen or here in home cooking, like the
kind of home cooking and I do with the sponsor of this video, HelloFresh. Let me thank them

meat? Again, people say that it clings better to the meat or dissolves against the meat
better. My test showed no real difference in terms of moisture that is taken out. What
I was struck by when I tried this was just how much physically easier it was to apply
the kosher salt to the meat. Course salts are pinchable. You reach down into a dish
of kosher salt, you grab some with two or three fingers and you can easily hoist it
over to the food. When you grab fine salt with your fingers, it just spills out. It
literally slips right through your fingers. I love getting to use idioms literally. I
made a huge mess trying to grab table salt with my fingers and dump it on the food. I
had trouble getting enough of it. It was just taking forever. So eventually, I just grabbed the dish and
I dumped it out onto the meat. To apply table salt in any but the tiniest quantity, you
need a tool for dispensing it, like a shaker. A shaker is a thing that can clog up and it
can get dirty, especially in a context where you're handling lots of raw meat and then
picking up the shaker. I think just being able to reach into an open dish and pinch
out the salt you need is just way easier — way more convenient in pretty much any the cooking
situation. Now, a lot of chefs say they can better estimate
the quantity of kosher salt by feel. They get more consistent pinches when they're pinching
a course salt. I got out my super fine jeweler's scale and I tried weighing a bunch of my kosher
salt pinches, and then I tried weighing a bunch of my table salt pinches. I was pretty
inaccurate with both of them. With either salts, some of my pinches were 50% heavier
than others, even though I was trying really hard to be consistent. But what I did notice
is that I was able to pinch nearly twice as much salt at a time with the coarse salt.
I was just able to get a lot more out of the dish with my fingers when I was grabbing the
kosher stuff, which is a particularly useful for operations that involve a lots and lots
of salt, like koshering. And again, look at the mess — look at the
table salt I spilled all over the table. I dropped hardly any of the kosher salt. Kosher
salt is just way easier to handle. Here's one way in which I think it is definitely
easier to estimate the quantity of kosher salt, and that is by eye. The grains of table
salt are so small and they dissolve so fast that I really had trouble seeing how much
salt I had put on this meat. In contrast, the kosher salt is plain as day. Even if you
have bad eyesight or if your face is up and away from your working surface, you can still
see plain as day how many grains of salt you've put on there. Same deal with seasoning at
the table, especially with something like white meat. The table salt I shake on is invisible.
The kosher salt is not. I can see what I'm doing. I feel that one of the most useful skills
that I've cultivated as a home cook is the ability to judge visually about how much salt
I will like on something. That just makes cooking so much easier, for among other reasons
because salt is really, really hard to measure. Normal kitchen scales are not sensitive enough
for the quantities of salt that we typically use in home cooking. They just aren't accurate
when it comes to differences of a gram or two. Measuring salt by volume isn't great
either because different salts have radically different densities, which brings us right
back where we started: kosher salt isn't just one thing. A teaspoon of Morton kosher will weigh nearly
twice as much as a teaspoon of Diamond Crystal. This is because they're two totally different
things. Both companies use proprietary processes, so we don't know exactly how they make it,
but they've both said that they start with brine. It's a brine they get by pumping water
down into underground salt deposits, dissolving that salt into water, and then pumping the
resulting brine back up to the surface where they get the salt out of solution. Diamond
Crystal uses an evaporative process that gets you these tiny hollow pyramid shapes. These
are crystal formations that sodium chloride forms naturally. It's basically a miniature
version of this Maldon sea salt. The pyramidal crystal formation has a big hollow at its
center, so any given volume of these crystals is going to be less dense, less heavy. It's
mostly air. We know even less about how Morton kosher
is made. The most we know comes from a quote the company gave to Cooks Illustrated a couple
of years ago. They say they boil the brine to concentrate the salt and then they press
the resulting crystals through high-pressure rollers to flatten them into flakes. In that
sense, I'm not even sure if these are technically crystals. They might be more like little cakes
of crystals. That would explain why they look more like this stuff: pretzel salt. Pretzel
salt has made by pressing a salt dust into big cubes that are designed to break apart
easily between your teeth. I suspect something kind of similar is going on with Morton kosher
because Morton kosher has kind of a similar breakaway texture that I really like, but
I'm just guessing here because the good folks at the Morton company did not reply to my
interview request. Regardless, it is empirically true that Morton
salt has flat flakes, not hollow cuboids. Both products are the result of modern industrial
processes that produce big flaky salts for far less money — far less money than the
ancient evaporative methods used for something like Maldon sea salt from England. This is
the other ism at play here, right? Industrialism. The United States has always been the global
leader in new technologies to make food cheaper and more standardized. That is, of course,
a dubious distinction. But I'm sure that Jewish families and food processors here have appreciated
it. You go through a lot of salt koshering meat.
I can't imagine doing it with a more expensive sea salt. For Americans who don't keep kosher,
Morton table salt and its imitators became the clear favorite over the course of the
20th century. It's similarly a result of modern industrial tinkering. Their process gets perfectly
uniform cubes and their additives guarantee that said cubes will not clump up even on
a rainy day. That's what the Morton salt girl signifies with her raincoat and her umbrella.
As a result of this typically American food standardization, this kind of table salt,
for a long time, was pretty much the only kind of food salt that you could find reliably
in mainstream American grocery stores — except for the kosher salt. So when American cooks wanted to reach for
a big flaky salt, kosher was the most readily available option. It's great for all the reasons
that we've discussed, and one more: heterogeneity. Big concentrated chunks of salt create a more
varied eating experience compared to tiny little crystals, which disperse much more
evenly, both on the food and in the mouth. So if you're outside the United States and
you're reading a recipe written by an American like me and it calls for kosher salt, just
reach for any big flaky salts that you would use for heterogeneity at the table. That's
all we mean. That's all kosher salt really is.",3

***RECIPE, MAKES...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.186359, i think i figured out a good trick for making pad thai at home prep as many portions as you want but only cook one or two portions at a time this is especially helpful if you don't have a big wok and or a super powerful stove it might sound onerous to only cook a little at a time but wait until you see how fast it cooks pad thai of course is a noodle-based stir-fry in a sweet and sour sauce to me the sauce's defining ingredients are thai style fish sauce basically salty fermented fish juice and extract of the tamarind fruit had to get this at my asian market this is the concentrate which i prefer to tamarind paste it'll be our primary source of acidity though some people use vinegar or lime instead in a pinch you could replace both of these ingredients with worcestershire sauce this is a vinegary fermented fish sauce flavored with wait for it tamarind it wouldn't be exactly the same but it would do the same job and i suppose the other key ingredient is sugar the pad thai that i know and love from thai american restaurants is insanely sweet i'm using two or three tablespoons of sugar for two large portions a lot of people use brown sugar or various less refined sugars they'd all work about a tablespoon of fish sauce smells like feet tastes like meat very strong source of umami you only need a little and you could use soy sauce instead to keep it meatless i like a little bit of soy with the fish sauce maybe a teaspoon now the tamarind extract i'm using two teaspoons of the concentrate but you know about me and acidity you might want to start with half this quantity i also love the smooth glossy texture that you get from the concentrate if i diluted this with like two parts water to one part concentrate i'd get about the same strength as tamarind paste i'm not bothering to dilute because i'm going to add some water to the pan at the very end now the secret ingredient to what i'll describe as mall pad thai here in the states is ketchup before anybody sneers consider that many pad thai recipes call for vinegar sugar and tomato paste well guess what ketchup is this lightens the color and also makes the sauce more glossy i put in almost two tablespoons in there you have to play with the basic proportions to find out what you like and of course you could just buy a jarred pad thai sauce that's still a little gritty but the sugar will dissolve as we do everything else a big handful of peanuts for garnish i'll chop those up a little bit not too fine the whole point is to have some crunchy texture against the soft noodles today is a good day to have little prep bowls one bunch of green onions you could use any onion but these are good from my method because they cook almost instantly if you slice the whites really thin and then you have the greens up there that you can set aside and use as a raw garnish the rest will go into my aromatics bowl fresh ginger a little thumb size piece slice off the skin and chop it up a roughly equal amount of garlic peeled and coarsely chopped don't go too fine in the garlic or it'll be liable to burn here in the aromatics bowl with that and then i'm gonna do one red chili thinly sliced i'm leaving behind the top which is where a lot of the heat lives i'm gonna pick a big pile of cilantro leaves for garnish highly optional the other table garnish will be some lime wedges which you probably won't need if you use as much tamarind concentrate as i do oh and mung bean sprouts these came washed and prepped i just need to have the open bag handy now protein a couple of eggs vegans can totally skip them these scramble so much better if you salt them pretty heavily beat them thoroughly and then let them sit for like 10 minutes the salt kind of loosens the proteins and it helps them cook in these delicate thin sheets that i like in a stir fry time for the mother and child reunion one chicken breast should be enough protein for two dinner size portions shrimp or tofu work great as well the trick with the chicken breast is to cut it into three sections and then make very thin slices across the grain you should be able to see the meat fibers plain as day cut across them i'm basically slicing as thinly as i can across those fibers it helps to have a freshly sharpened knife for this cutting across the grain will get us much more tender pieces thin meat slices in stir fry tend to be chewy now i'll put these into two separate piles for my two big portions that i'm cooking gotta keep my salt handy and my final ingredient will be some water stir fries go so fast that you want to have every single thing prepped before you actually cook i've got all my ingredients within arm's reach and i'll scan my grocery receipt into the

the description thank you fetch now i find pad thai way easier to cook in a non-stick pan this makes it fool proof and i'm going to boil my noodles right in here there's no need to get a second pan dirty and water boils in a flash in a wide pan a little pinch of salt in there heat on high rice noodles sold for pad thai are usually flat and narrow though you can use wider ones half of this package will feed two people two ounces or 60 grams per portion and i'm sure this is going to make some people unhappy but i've been breaking these as i put them in the water if i don't the noodles are so long that i have a lot of trouble integrating them with the sauce and the other ingredients at the end i'm just stirring to make sure they don't stick to the bottom i think the more traditional way to cook thai rice noodles is to cover them in boiling water from a kettle or something and then let them steep i have found straight up boiling to be quicker and easier to control and i'm only gonna parboil them two or three minutes max then in this goes to a strainer and i'll shock with cold water to stop them from cooking and sticking to each other let that hang and drain and they'll hold there until i'm ready to finish cooking them i'll wipe out my pan real quick back on the stove heat on high you can get away with high heat on a non-stick pan as long as you keep the pan full of food to absorb that energy i'm using that bit of virgin oil as a thermometer the instant i see it just start to smoke i'll season my first pile of chicken real quick and then drop it in the pan get the pieces pushed out into a single flat layer wash my hand real quick and then from here on out i am showing you this in real time i'm not speeding any of this up by letting the meat just sit there we can get a little brown color on it without overcooking the interior they're going to cook most of the way on that side when i can see the bottom two thirds of these is opaque i'm going to throw in half of my aromatics the green onions the chili the garlic the ginger and then once they're in i'm gonna stir everything really aggressively the top of the chicken is still raw and that's just fine this is exactly how i would do it with whole shrimp too by the way for the same dish i tried it that way it was great i wanted to devise a process that did not involve cooking a bunch of things one at a time dumping them out putting them back in again lots of recipes have you do that i didn't want to do that i just want to put things in the pan and keep them there so i've pushed everything over to one side of the pan and the chicken still should not be quite cooked that's fine time for half of the beaten eggs in a really thin layer spread it around let it sit and start to solidify wait for it wait for it wait for it then you can scrape at it with the spoon and this gets you those thin sheets of egg that are really nice in a stir fry salting the eggs also helps them to not overcook even when you get some color on them which is what i'm trying to do here the salt loosens those proteins so they don't squeeze all the water out of the egg so we'll push all of that egg to one side go over to the sink and grab some of those parboiled noodles and there they go they'll finish cooking now half of my sauce is going to go in next or maybe less than half you can always add more i suppose i like my pad thai very saucy so in goes half of that sauce and i'm gonna grab a big handful of those mung bean sprouts i like a lot of those i mean really i like half bean sprouts half noodles that's way healthier too i also like to get some of the peanuts mixed through everything we'll garnish with some at the end but a little bit of peanuts all the way through then stir stir stir stir some people prefer to keep the bean sprouts totally raw adam at the end i like for them to basically blend in with the noodles and you can kind of mistake them for the noodles they're just barely going to cook anyway because we're almost done here i like to keep my sauce really tight and dry not much water in the sauce that's why i didn't dilute anything so that now at the very end i can just add as much water as i want to get that level of saucy texture that i desire so i'm just going to wait until this is looking pretty much as mixed as i can get it and grab the water and grab the water this is weird to do in real time and there we go and that just deglazes the pan too which is really really nice and we'll just give that a few seconds to cook and tighten up again the water helps you get everything really smoothly mixed together if we were cooking several portions at once in this little pan we just wouldn't be able to get the intense heat that gives a stir fry its characteristic flavor you need a big wok on a rip roaring burner for that but for one big dinner portion this is perfect beautiful done garnishes on the side pile of cilantro more peanuts to sprinkle on top for heterogeneity lime for squeezing and maybe i'll put the onion greens on top man i love this stuff the feet smell of fish sauce boils right out don't worry about that it's gone and check the chicken pieces brown and yet not overcooked that's quite a magic trick with thin pieces of white meat and now you can turn around and do the next portion which should take literally no more than three minutes as we have just proven please do not take this as an attempt at definitive authentic pad thai it's just how i've gotten the best results in my kitchen chasing the version of the dish that i know and love and since my favorite thai place where i live just closed i am very happy to have cracked this nut to my own satisfaction,3

squarespace so here's a primer on sharpening kitchen knives with stones whetstones they're called with an h we'll talk about what the h means we're going to cover the basic theory of knife sharpening the minimal gear you'd need technique cleanup and maintenance even if you don't plan to actually try this yourself this video should be interesting if you like to understand how things work i mean in this humble home cook's opinion the best sharpener is the one that you're actually going to use a well-reviewed multi-stage pull through sharpener like this has served me well for many years the first stage cuts the new edge the second stage refines it easy i think these are good enough for us normals as long as you get one that's made for the basic kind of knife and steel that you have we'll get to that but it is true that the pros generally sharpen with stones the old-fashioned way the hard way or they pay someone to do it the hard way as many excellent chefs have paid my buddy chef davis wells to sharpen their knives a few james beard award winners ashley christensen steven satterfield chidi kumar who is nominee always the pride maid and not the bride but i love you chibi these are some of the very top chefs here in the american southeast and davis does their knives or he used to do their knives it was eventually easier to actually go back into a kitchen because sharpening 40 to 60 knives a week is really a lot of strain on my body especially my hands and joints when working the line at high-end restaurants is the comparatively easy job then you know you're talking about doing something that's pretty tough why do people bother most other sharpening devices are basically ripping metal across the edge so like a pull through sharpener or they are grinding it off mechanically and the advantage here is a stone remains cool so it won't detemper the blade which will make the blade prematurely dull or not even get too sharp it results in a finer clean edge and by not mechanically grinding you're not removing more steel than you really need to be for a truly sharp knife and that last point matters especially if you invest in some really nice knives like davis owns thousands of dollars worth of steel the less metal you remove every time you sharpen the less money you're grinding away the longer the knife is going to last you and of course stones offer you total control you can use them to cut a very narrow cutting angle like this be really really sharp or you can use them to cut a wider cutting edge like this this will be really tough like an axe and you can use stones for the standard western double beveled knives or single beveled asian style knives like these knives that only taper down to a point on one side we're talking about double beveled sharpening today but stones can do it all that doesn't mean however that you can sharpen any knife on any stone this is the first kind of unfortunate thing about sharpening with stones there isn't really one all-purpose piece of gear that you can buy to get started you're going to need to buy at least two or three things even if you only have one knife to sharpen so from the top here's davis showing us this cross-section view of a dull knife the cross-section of a blade is known as its geometry and the whole point of sharpening is to take two planes like this like this and make them converge at a point of zero thickness right here and as we progressively grind away metal to make those planes converge a little piece of metal will shoot past like this and it'll feel like a little fingernail on the edge of it this is known as the bur and you can feel it safely by pulling your thumb across perpendicular to the blade you go parallel to the blade you're going to slice yourself open but if you go perpendicular to the blade that's safe that's what we do when we're shaving right you can safely feel for the burr and you kind of have to feel for the burr because you really can't see it not even under my microscope camera this area down here this is the face of the knife this area is the newly sharpened bevel and this tiny distinct strip at the top if you can see that that is the burr if we look at the knife from above i can't even see the burr what i can see now is where the burr is missing in the spot where my microscope just touched the edge missing bit of burr right there the bur bends or breaks off really easily and it's supposed to and the whole point of sharpening is to create a burr and a nice consistent even bird down the whole length of the blade and then remove that so that you just get that with a clean point of again zero thickness and that happens in the finishing phase of sharpening we use a coarsely textured stone to grind out that new edge grind out that bur and then we have to switch over to a more finely textured stone we use this to polish off that bur and to align the micro serrations we've been talking thus far about the geometry or cross-section of the blade now we talk about its profile all knife edges are serrated and they are what are called teeth and these teeth are determined by the grit at which they were sharpened a coarser stone with bigger micro particles is going to cut bigger wider teeth right like if you imagine like this is a big particle in a big coarse stone it is going to knock a big chunk out of the knife as the blade comes down across that particle if this is a small particle from a finer stone it's going to take a smaller chunk out of the blade as it passes by the number on these stones indicates the particle size confusingly the bigger the number the smaller the particle size this is because the number goes by the spatial density of particles fewer big particles will fit into a given area right that's why you would call the grit of this one ten and the grit of this one twenty a twelve hundred stone like this is a medium grit stone davis does not recommend super coarse stones for us beginners because we might end up grinding off way too much material he recommends we start with a medium grit stone this is going to be our coarse stone this is for that initial phase of cutting out the new edge that's what will give you those big teeth working the knife against a finer stone wears away at that bur of big teeth so that eventually these become fine enough where they could you know shave the hair on your arm dice an onion without making you cry these are the things that a real sharp knife does well and that right there is the main reason why chefs don't cry when they cut onions it's not that they're tougher than you they just have way sharper knives that rupture fewer cell walls that said it is possible to sharpen the knife to the point where the teeth are kind of too small too fine and they have trouble kind of biting into tough things like tomato skins people who get really advanced with this stuff will finish a knife with a coarser stone to get big teeth for cutting certain things and they'll finish a knife with a finer stone to get tiny teeth for cutting things like raw fish you know doing sashimi where you want a really nice glossy smooth finish you want very very fine teeth and that way the japanese feel you actually improve the taste of the fish so which grit of stone you buy depends on what you want to do with your knife furthermore it depends on what kind of knife you have broadly speaking you've got german or european style knives and you have japanese or asian style knives they differ in their profile that is their shape they differ in their geometry and they differ in the hardness of the steel as indicated by the numbers on the rockwell hardness scale german french on the low end you'll start at about 52 to 54 rockwell hardness and these will go all the way up to typically about 58. glass is 60 rockwell hardness i'm sure we have knife nerds quibbling in the comments already and now we've got glass nerds yes there's definitely different kinds of glass he's talking in generalities your basic window glass so if your knife can scratch glass and leave a mark on it it means it is above 60 rockwell hardness so german and french steels generally you want to finish in the you know 2 000 to up to 4 000 range beyond that largely because of chromium content and softness of the steel you won't really improve the edge and chances are it will feel duller on the other end of the spectrum you have japanese steel which is often getting into the 60s on the rockwell scale harder than window glass the harder the steel the finer or narrower the edge it will hold very very tiny very spiky teeth very very sharp very very clean cuts but these are hard to work with hard to sharpen um very brittle to be clear he's talking there about knives on the extreme hard end of the spectrum not all japanese steel is that hard and brittle but some of it is super hard steel is less flexible therefore it's less durable a coarser finishing stone would just knock that super fine edge right off for really really hard steel you need a finer finishing stone that's what that 6000 8000 grit range is for it's for knives like these that are really for sushi chefs now between these two extremes you have basically my knife this is made by calphalon it was about 100 bucks i think when lauren bought it for me quite a few years ago and it is just an archetypal low to mid market hybrid east west knife they take elements of japanese knife smithing but really they're produced and tailored to more of the german and french market now these hybrid knives are getting super popular for a reason i think that this is the ideal all-purpose home kitchen chef knife it's the only knife that you need it's made to hold a 15 or 17 degree cutting edge cutting angle right there so it's made from steel that's a little bit between the european and japanese steel a little bit harder than normal german steel but not much not so hard that it becomes brittle and breaks off and becomes hard to work with and this of course dictates which grit of finishing stone we're gonna buy four to six thousand would be perfect you know so you can finish low for a little toothier edge or 6000 for a little finer smoother edge so i got this 4000 grit finishing stone that should work just fine with the pretty standard hybrid knives that i always use but i'm just dipping my toes into all of this people over time just find that they like certain grits for certain knives and for certain effects and they like different grits on different brands of stone or different materials of stone you got your natural synthetic or ceramic stones we're not even getting into all that today the rabbit hole has no end but when you start you need a coarse stone and a fine stone now you can get a combo stone that has one grit on this side and a different grit on this side you just flip it around to use one of the other those are cool the problem with that is that sharpening on a stone removes material from the stone just as it removes material from the knife and so if you're doing that to both sides eventually you can have a problem where it doesn't really lay flat eventually this is dished and you might get some weird angles here and then we flip it those same weird angles will be apparent in this top stone so um i'm not a huge fan of combo stones even though i have one this leads us to the third and final thing that you have to buy to get started you need a stone for sharpening your stone seriously they're called flattening stones or lapping stones lapping plates leveling plates i'm sure there's subtle and debatable shades of meaning within those terms this particular flattening tool the davis is using is called a diamond plate it's just got to be something that's bigger and harder than your stones that you use to re-level your stones so these are the three things that you need to get started a coarse stone a fine stone which could be the same stone could be a combo and then you need something to level the stone with those are the three things now let's actually do this step one is to wet your wet stone soak them in water fun fact wet with an h does not mean to make moist it's a very old anglo-saxon word that means to sharpen or more broadly to get something ready hence the expression wet the appetite wet with an h means to prime or prepare your appetite which incidentally will make your mouth w-e-t wet hence the confusion about what the two wets mean anyway all wet stones with an h need to be wet without an h but not all of them need to be soaked in advance there are splash and go stones that you only have to wet as you use them and then there are soaking stones that have to be soaked far in advance splash and go might be more convenient but they're generally more expensive and davis thinks they're bad for beginners they're harder less porous so they give you less tactile feedback as you sharpen against them that's why i went with soaking stones as you can see it is absorbing water like a sponge there pros often keep their soaking stones permanently in water they call it perma-soak though you have to change the water periodically to keep it from molding now if you're soaking a dry stone how do you know when it's ready little air bubbles will release from it and you'll hear and when that stops happening it's ready to go then you can just do this on a damp towel on the counter the towel holds the stone steady and it gives you something to wipe the knife on davis recommends using a loaf pan or something to raise the stone up higher that way your knuckles won't bang into the counter as you're working our soaked coarse stone goes on top there and you want to have a bowl of water handy so that you can keep everything wet as you work step one is to use that diamond plate to flatten the stone which was made uneven by our previous sharpening session so you want even pressure along the middle of the stone and i'm trying to keep my hand directly over the stone so i'm not curving the edges at all i will however take this and do kind of an edge bevel which is going to strengthen the edge of the stone geometrically so that ideally you don't get chips like this he's just rounding off the corners so they won't be really extreme sharp right angles one thing flattening does as well is it'll it brings up grit with which to work called mud that mud is basically the lubricant for the knife speaking of the knife you can see that davis favors a three-point grip for sharpening his dominant hand is on the handle the thumb is on the heel of the knife and his finger is out on the spine and then the blade is facing him and from here up to my elbow will stay pretty much fixed throughout the whole process and most of the motion is coming from my shoulder down to my elbow and this is how we're going to keep angle control right and then pressure on the knife comes from my left hand and i'm going to put two or three fingers depending on the knife here this hand always stays over the stone for safety reasons and this is the motion that davis uses he's pushing back and forth pushing harder on the outward stroke which is probably what your body will do naturally anyway and as he's pushing back and forth he is gradually drawing the knife perpendicularly across the stone to sharpen the entire length of the blade as he gets toward the tip he rotates the knife slightly so that he follows its natural curvature or belly he rotates it by lifting his elbow a little bit rather than twisting his wrist the wrist stays fixed to make a consistent bevel now let's talk about angles the face of the blade is at like a 15 or 20 degree angle from the stone some people use angle guides to get exactly the cutting angle they want davis recommends that even beginners just go freehand i'm sure when you get more advanced you can really control the angle of the edge that you put on this knife but if you're just starting out like me david says you really can just kind of feel for what feels natural there's a angle that just feels right that kind of feels like you're shaving little bits of sand off of the stone which i suppose you literally are doing if it seems like you're getting that shaving feeling you're basically gonna reproduce the bevel angle that the knife had previously do it feels right and you can only go so wrong there is another kind of angle to consider though and that is the angle of the length of the blade relative to the stone he's got that at like 45 degrees again that's kind of what the arm does naturally and that's good 45 degrees is right looks like side one of the knife is about done we'll check to see how we're doing here to see if we've raised that bur at all and we in fact have and it's pretty consistent all the way down now he'll wipe the knife and re-wet the stone you'll feel the instinct to do that too when things get too dry the knife just does not move smoothly across the stone you'll want to wet it when it's time when we're wetting we're also removing some of what's called the swarf which is the the steel that's abraded from the knife now look there he's rotated the handle of the knife in his hand so the blade is now pointed away from him before it was pointed toward him he's using the same three-point grip it's time to sharpen the other side of the edge and look he has changed the angle the length of the blade is now perpendicular to the stone it's 90 degrees as opposed to the 45 that he did on the first side we do a 45 angle here and basically 90 degree angle here and that theoretically creates teeth like this that are more beneficial from for cutting that might seem kind of hard to remember but again like ergonomically i think this is kind of just what happens naturally you got the blade pointed towards you and you just kind of hold it at like a 45 you point the blade away and then the handle just naturally kind of goes to a 90 degree angle like that it's just what comes natural and it works it's the same basic motion back and forth gradually drawing the length of the blade over the stone and now the burr is no longer on this side it's now coming back to this side so we know that we're making progress here and that we've got basically two edges that have come together more or less at a point and so we've got a piece of steel that's flipping back and forth so now davis is going to repeat the whole process a couple more times for progressively fewer passes and with progressively lighter pressure and that's going to reduce the width of the burr that we've created so that we can kind of preface that before we move to a finer stone so we have to do less work on that fine stone but of course whatever davis does he is sure to flip the knife around and do about the same thing to the opposite side as well got to keep things symmetrical because we are sharpening a double bevel knife right now some people use a little circular motion instead of the long strokes back and forth some people do other motions what davis is showing us is a traditional japanese method but it's certainly not the only viable one time now to switch over to the finishing stone the finer grit stone that's what that one is there and the first thing we do with that is to use that diamond plate the flattening stone to get everything even from our last sharpening session i recommend buying the largest stones that you can find because surface area is important and mass is important and the height of the stone is basically the life of the stone so the the thicker a stone is the longer it will last you it's the same exact process as we did on the coarse stone he's just using a little bit less pressure this time which again i find is what my body wants to do naturally with the finer stones he'll stop every now and then and feel for the burr or rather he's feeling for the absence of a burr when the burr is gone the knife is sharpened and the last thing he'll do is strop the blade a stropping motion is the same thing but it's a one-way trip pushing or pulling opposite the direction of the edge one way swipes and you are stropping away from the part of the knife that cuts stropping hones the blade or gets those little micro teeth standing upright it's the same thing that you can use a honing steel to do in between sharpenings though depending on how rough and how hard the honing steel is it might actually remove some material too there is no need to use a honing steel immediately after you have stropped the blade on your fine grit stone it is ready it is honed clean it off and that knife is sharp af and if there is any dullness or snag in the edge we'll see it in that cut because it'll be kind of a tear and those look pretty clean to me so we're not endorsing any particular products here there are some notes in the description describing in general terms what kinds of gear you need to acquire wherever you're going to acquire them and then there's just kind of a bare bones write up step by step of davis's basic sharpening technique and look i'm still all about my pull through sharpener but you can't deny this is better look under the microscope see that nasty scratch pattern there that's from my pull through sharpener where it looks beautiful and polished that's what davis did on the stones and as an added bonus that diamond plate you can use that to fix major structural flaws in the knife like huge chips or the dull point where i dropped this knife in the street about a year ago perceptive viewers have noticed that he's just using a rough diamond plate to cut a whole new point of the blade there that tip is almost as nice as this last one if you're going to get into stones davis says buy one of these a sink bridge these are adjustable brackets that hold the stone over the sink then you've got your water right there to keep the stone wet and all the mess is contained in the stink that you can then just wash down when you're done davis normally does the whole process right there in the sink it's like building your entire website in squarespace everything

***PIZZA 1,...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.186359, french bread pizza is this american school lunch abomination we always had it fridays at my elementary school you take a big soft white loaf that no frenchman would recognize as being french or bread probably you cut it into big boats on a baking sheet and soak it in plenty of olive oil or butter or margarine and maybe some seasoning like it's garlic bread if you don't soak some fat in there it ends up being really dry most recipes have you toast the pieces in the oven for a few minutes if you don't do that the final thing ends up being super soggy then you smooth on some pizza sauce top with cheese and bake until the cheese is melted there you go cut that up and lauren said it tastes like a busy mom in the 80s just doing her best you know it's a good meal concept and i'm sure it could be improved first by actually browning the cheese but here's why people don't usually do that fully baked bread will burn at the temperatures at which cheese browns that's why the cheese on french bread pizza is usually pretty pallid i tried covering the exposed edges in little strips of aluminum foil that was a pain and the cheese stuck to it you want to see the easy thing that i found works dabbing it with water that's all a pastry brush into a bowl of water liberally dab the exposed edge of bread right before it goes in the oven if you do it too far in advance the water soaks too far deep into the bread there you go much better and you might get a few charred spots still but it's nothing you can't just pinch off those edges are not soggy at all the water has evaporated and they've browned nicely the water just slowed them down already quite a bit tastier but let's start fresh rather than think of this as garlic bread with pizza toppings let's think of it like an open-faced panini a sandwich sized ciabatta cut in half oven-safe pan on the stove big knob of butter turn the heat on medium you could use olive oil but butter is tasty and it's great at being its own thermometer when it's starting to bubble yeah i'm gonna season my pan not my bread just a little salt that i want to fry into that bread surface mop up all that butter and seasoning into the cut sides and then it's time to smash this is a brick wrapped in foil but anything flat and heavy will do it smashing that bread down gets you really thorough browning my oven is cold i'm just going to flip on the top element the broiler it heats in like two minutes ah you can see the outside rim of the pan is not as hot i'll rotate these around and give them another minute beautiful flip them onto their back sides and i'm gonna put in a little olive oil to fry the bottoms it tastes good in combination with the butter and it's less likely to burn in this next phase turning my heat off because electric burners like these take a long time to cool down if i was doing this on gas i'd probably just turn it to low while i dress the pizzas you can get a nice little effect if you put some big pieces of fresh herb on the sauce layer whole parsley leaves or half basil leaves a little parmesan topped with some mozzarella and i want those parsley leaves poking through semi-covered they're gonna look real pretty and the key step that i'm very happy i figured out brush all the exposed bread with water that should keep it safe under the grill as brits would call it just as we can keep ourselves safe on the internet with surf shark the sponsor of this video now that i got that vax i'm excited to travel again surfsharkvpn will be my buddy you hit connect

that link and code in the description for 83 off thank you surf shock all right now throw these under the broiler watch them close they only took four minutes under there and there you go looks like the thumbnail to me anything like this will be crispier if you cool it on a rack so steam can escape those edges would be burnt black if we had not done the water trick any sauce could work here i'm just using my standard sauce which is this brand of very strongly flavored ground tomatoes a little olive oil spices maybe a pinch of sugar that's it any mozzarella is fine but i'm using my very favorite pizza cheese which is this brand of whole milk low moisture string cheese it's a pain to unwrap and chop up if you're gonna make a bunch of big pizzas but it's actually perfect for making little french bread pizzas because you only need like two sticks worth for this and the rest stays vacuum sealed it's convenient nice and crispy shiny bottom on those and because we press them flat they have that satisfyingly dense panini bite they're easier to fit in your mouth and frankly the experience is just much more pizza like than eating a big thick loaf okay let's do one more where we get creative a couple of garlic cloves and orange zest it might sound weird but orange and tomato is my new favorite flavor combination save that orange we'll use it then some parsley i'm making gremolata which is my new favorite pizza topping it's usually made with lemon zest but i'm loving it with orange you just chop it into itself and the flavors really do seem to merge set that aside i'll peel and roughly chop a shallot and check out this new sauce that i've been playing with olive oil in a pretty hot pan saute the shallots until they're just starting to brown and then in go a few high quality whole canned plum tomatoes i'll mash those up a little bit to get them going but we're going to puree this later so don't stress about it my heat is like medium high i'll just stir these until they get some color the pan starts to go dry before that stuff on the bottom burns deglaze with the juice of that orange i'm just using my hand to catch any seeds all the juice from that orange get everything deglazed and that's it and it goes to a narrow vessel followed by a couple more of the nearly raw tomatoes straight from the can the sauce would taste too cooked without them and hit these with the stick until smooth tomato and orange i swear it's awesome it's just a little sweet so balance that with some chili nice and let's do a bigger pizza this time a real big loaf here and it can be stale this is stale that's as big a bread boat as will fit in my biggest pan my 12 incher but first big chunks of pancetta or any bacon-like product cold pan turn the heat on medium and let that fat slowly render as the heat comes in stir a bit and you don't want to take them any farther than this at this stage otherwise they'll have the texture of bacon bits by the time the pizza is done i'm just pulling out most of them while trying to leave any fat behind arrange the remaining meat and roughly the shape of the bread i think i need some more fat so a little olive oil and then in goes the bread cut side down and this time i'll smash it flat with another pan that works you just gotta lean into it with your body weight just takes a couple of minutes and you can smell when it's about ready to flip that bread stuck a little bit no problem spatula got it off and yeah now we've got browned pancetta chunks embedded into our bread it's a good day to be alive just a little more olive oil to fry the bottom turn the heat off i'll dust with a little garlic powder i meant to do that on the last one too on goes that sauce a little parm from the can just tastes right on pizza to me the stuff from the can carefully place that cheese you don't want too much of it to roll off onto the pan it'll burn and smell finally the remaining pancetta in and amongst the cheese can't forget to brush the exposed cut sides with water sometimes i start these on the middle rack under the broiler and then maybe move them to the top depending on how they're looking again it was just maybe five minutes and here we are hot with three t's sprinkle that with some gremolata and let it cool on the rack i love the flaky crispy bottom that you get from using the top of the bread loaf chop that up and come on how are you gonna be snobby about that that is good food i don't care if it's descended from a frozen dinner that they gave us at park forest elementary on fridays in 1989 that is good pizza,3
Why some people eat 'dirt' — white kaolin clay,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hQD9-FBs2qQ/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLCe9sFkiV1Fi1cLLRd-r0C6bB0dNg,hQD9-FBs2qQ,"11 minutes, 5 seconds","Thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this video!

squarespace where i live a lot of people eat dirt they've eaten dirt for generations specifically this thing they call white dirt it is a clay a kind of clay called kaolin it just tastes like basically nothing just kind of chalky with these crunchy little crystals inside it why exactly would people eat this well eating dirt is a great example of the universally applicable axiom geography is destiny whenever one is wondering why some group of people seems to be different in some way the root cause is usually geography nothing intrinsic to the people but it's all about where they live or where they used to live geography is destiny so this video is about food and eating but follow me on a tangent about geography or more specifically geology go rocks all around the world you have some low-lying flat areas known as coastal plains this is the coastal plain of india actually two of them on either side they meet at land's end there this is the atlantic coastal plain of north america it's an area on the continental shelf that used to be ocean floor during interglacial periods when seas were higher that's one reason why it's so flat another reason coastal plains are flat is that rivers come flowing down from the adjacent uplands and then when they hit the sea all the sediment that the rivers are carrying just kind of goes blue you get this long big wide flat piece of land with really sandy soil and the difference is visually appreciable on the ground you can tell when you're on a coastal plain just north of the coastal plain here in georgia there is a higher plateau region called the piedmont it's named after the latin word for foothill just as pimonte in italy is a foothill region of the alps the piedmont is a foothill region of the appalachians when you're up in the piedmont the landscape is rolling hills and lush deciduous forest you go down into the coastal plain and all of a sudden it's flat as a pancake and it's covered in scrappy ass pine trees that grow in sandy soil the dividing line between these two regions the piedmont and the coastal plain this is known as the fall line it's called that because it is demarcated by literal waterfalls below the fall line the land is flat so rivers are flat they're slow they're smooth they're navigable easy rafting or canoeing in these waters if you boat up river eventually you hit the fall line where the water is literally falling from that higher piedmont region down onto the lower continental shelf you cannot row your little boat up that if you've come this far from the sea you either turn around and you go back or you look over to the shore and you say well i guess we live here now hence a constellation of major settlements all along the fall line all with pre-columbian routes here's the ocmulgee river in georgia just below the fall line over here you've got earthworks built by ancient mississippian people over here you've got the modern city of macon fall lines collect people just as they collect sediment though alas not all of them came here willingly the atlantic coastal plain is what enabled plantation style agriculture clear those scrappy ass pines and you have vast vast flat acres of well-drained sandy soil the kind of soil that's perfect for cotton and tobacco europeans blessed with the perfect geography for the age of sale abducted people from west africa and forced them to grow cash crops along the coastal plain you grow that cotton and then you need to get to market somehow so you put it on a wagon and you take it to the nearest river and at that point you have two options you can either float it down to a port like savannah or charleston where you put it on a ship to england or to new england where the cool fast-moving rivers provided the perfect water power for textile mills because geography is destiny or you can paddle your stuff upriver as far as you can go to a town where the fall line also provides some water power for textile mills and being that this town is at the head of a major waterway it becomes a logical place to build a major railway hub to get stuff even further north and yeah geography is destiny this shape kind of looks like the fall line too the fall line and areas of the coastal plain just south of it but this is not showing us geology it is showing us human beings these are counties where at least 30 percent of the people living there today are african-american it is known historically as the black belt a legacy of plantation agriculture but if you look at the georgia fall line from space you will see white just south of macon here blindingly bright patches of white there's one there's one there's one there's one there's one there's one there's one all along the fall line really just below the fall line what are they well let's zoom in and i think that we have found the source of grandma's white dirt kaolin mines kaolinite is a kind of clay and clays are generally formed by the weathering of exposed rock the fall line where i am right now remember was the coastline back in the late cretaceous period when these deposits first started forming rocky cliff faces of the piedmont were worn away by water the resulting hydrous minerals flowed down and collected in pools that became clay deposits kaolinite in particular forms in hot wet conditions which is why the same tell-tale blinding white patches are visible from space in similar climates here's kaolinite mines in northern brazil in georgia a lot of the kale and clays mixed with iron oxide the stuff that makes georgia dirt red this clay is not that commercially useful but keep digging keep digging keep digging white gold so much white gold what can you use it for well you can use kaolin to make porcelain they figured that out in china millennia ago the name kaolin is of chinese origin check this blinding patch of white in china near zhao lin because it is so pure white kaolin is very useful in paper products in cosmetics and paints here's a testament to the purity of these kaolin deposits the rain water that collects in kaolin mines this is so eerily blue because it is pure it is not colored by the mineral in which it sits instead the sun reflects off the white clay bottom and literally lights up the pool's natural blue the owners of closed minds are constantly working to keep out swimmers check this blinding patch of white in indonesia they develop the crystal blue waters of that old kaolin mine into a major tourist attraction kaolin can also ease an upset stomach and historically lots of pharmaceuticals were based on this most notably chaopectates that's where the name comes from though they don't use kaolin in that anymore scientists call the practice of ingesting clay geophagy and it is something that people have historically done out of desperation in times of famine it's this soft chewable swallowable bulky material that is relatively biologically inert that you can just use to fill your stomach when you got nothing else however it is well documented that geophagy happens among people who are not desperate and starving in particular children and pregnant women scientists have speculated this craving for clay might have something to do with mineral deficiencies experienced by pregnant women or it might be an immune system thing the immune system does a lot of weird stuff during pregnancy and clays have natural filtering properties or clay could just be a cheap and relatively effective natural remedy for the various digestive problems of pregnancy of course once people start eating something they very rarely stop even after the conditions that initially prompted them to eat it have passed we're just programmed to like eating things that we're used to eating right that said eating a whole lot of this can cause health problems it can cause blockages and cause certain kinds of anemia and most infamously it causes uh teeth problems those little crystals in there can just grind away at your teeth over time right here is the most concerning research to me this indicates that geophagy might cause the very anemia that causes the craving for more dirt dirt has lots of vital minerals in it but it interferes with their absorption or bioavailability it's called bags of kaolin like this are not sold as food or medicine but as a novelty item obviously for legal reasons though go on the amazon reviews and people will tell you why they are buying it it's hard which is good i like crunchy hard but the only thing that i don't like is the aftertaste around here eating dirt is particularly associated with rural black women and nobody knows for sure why there's been a lot of research about this there's a bunch of links in the description could just be that kaolin was a ubiquitous cheap home remedy around these parts though some scholars have traced it back to geophagy in africa certainly lots of white people around here eat kaolin too and all kinds of people who do it will often regard it as a habit something they're a little bit bashful about something that is stigmatized a little bit maybe because of its association with rural poverty maybe just because it's so unusual but what may seem at first blush to be people acting weird is usually quite logical in its context right it's geography geography is destiny this is not to diminish the role of human agency though human choices human choices should go acknowledged in particular when talking about things like slavery right the dirt didn't make them do it though it did enable them to do it we all swim under our own power though geography is the river in which we paddle geography's flow deposited the people here as well as the dirt beneath their feet and geography shaped their interaction at the very least geography is why the earth is dotted by these patches as blindingly bright and shiny as a new website from squarespace web design and development do not have

Thanks to Leticia & Harry...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.186359, this is a sponsored video about trade coffee and this is one of trade's partner roasters showing us what coffee roasting really does to the bean and to our cups devotees may know that i only recently became a coffee obsessive and with the zeal of a convert i will now tell you what i wish i had known a lot sooner roast level is not an indicator of strength i think a lot of us noobs have an idea that light roasts are for light weights dark roasts are the real business yeah walk on home boy get some hairs on your chest and maybe you'll be ready for the dark stuff this attitude is nonsense roasting the bean to higher temperatures does not make coffee more intense or stimulating or anything it just makes the coffee different roasting is like any other kind of cooking the more an ingredient is cooked the more you're tasting the work of the chef the less it's cooked the more you're tasting the work of the farmer in this case there's no competition because the farmer and the chef are married this is leticia hutchins this is harry hutchins he's the main roaster here at alma coffee just north of atlanta leticia's family farm in honduras provides the beans my dad is a fourth generation coffee farmer from honduras he was born and raised in coffee farms and so i'm a fifth generation coffee farmer and then some of our certifications down at the farm we are usda certified organic down there um con manos de mujeres which means with women hands it was a certification we got to show that we treat women equally and give them the same opportunities and pay them fairly which in machismo driven cultures that's not always the case so we're really proud to be able to have that designation down in honduras yeah leticia is legit and she's the kind of person that you connect with when you buy coffee through trade you just go to drinktrade.com and take the quiz if you know nothing about what you like that's cool just say so but i know that i'm liking lighter roasts lately for reasons we will get to and then trade brews up a match for you with a roaster like alma you want whole bean pre-ground decaf caffeinated whatever they will match you with the right producer and then your coffee will arrive right at your door the first hundred of you can of course get a big discount on your first bag from trade with my link and code in the description check it out 50 off your first bag leticia is shipping out some orders for trade today in those signature red bags which are compostable by the way plant-based trade of course only partners with roasters that make you know good tasting coffee but trade also works really hard to make sure they only match you with roasters who source their beans responsibly and what does that mean coffee is one of these crops that is particularly prone to inequitable international trade it is primarily grown in less developed countries and exported to much richer ones the farmers often have very little leverage with which to demand fair prices for their product it's not even sustainable for them to feed their kids put food on the table and that's really where the issue is we personally know farmers that have had to cut down their farms burn their trees they're forced to go into other job opportunities raising cattle or sometimes even illegal activity unfortunately in some of these countries so along with that as well other middlemen will sometimes mix old crop with new crops so you or you know bad crop with good crop and you end up with this average soup because you can't trace green beans no she's not talking about like green beans green beans she's talking about these green coffee beans from her family's own farm so she knows exactly what she's working with or rather what her husband harry is working with he's the roaster here at alma different varieties different origins different terroirs the environment that the coffee has grown will yield different flavors and that's what's really fun about coffee and what's fun about trade is you get to try coffee from all over these are this is the green coffee these are there's two of these seeds per coffee cherry and it is green because all they've done to it so far is remove it from the fruit and dry it that's it now green coffee is a thing you can grind that up and brew it you get something that tastes a lot more like herbal tea than it does like coffee to get that coffee taste you really gotta roast it at least a little and because harry and leticia are young and cool they have opted for a very untraditional very tech automated roasting system about six inch flame that heats up the air and brings that air through the coffee roaster right here there's actually a distribution plate that will expand the heat of the hot air and drive it through the bean pile i really like this roaster for the consistency because it is air roasted uh versus uh with with a drum i feel like i have a lot more precision indeed check the graph that harry has programmed in the x-axis is time the y-axis is temperature he can draw a line and the machine will execute it reliably hey look they named the roast after me now don't think for a second that the machine is doing all the work harry did a lot of r and d to come up with these curves that he uses and the process requires his constant very close attention this first phase of roasting is called drying it's exactly what it sounds like and it takes a couple of minutes so i'm actually going to pull some out for you smells very similar to straw or hay yep that's a good description kind of gross honestly being around coffee roasting is not like being around like cake baking it's not all romantic wonderful smells coffee throws off some pretty weird volatile compounds as it heats up it also of course throws off water and as you drive that water away you are able to achieve temperatures on and in the bean where you can get the mayard reaction that's the same browning reaction that gets you a delicious crust on bread for example and the temperatures here are typical baking temperatures this is how the coffee looks at about 340 fahrenheit 170c five minutes in this is where we're going to start going a little after where the mayard phase has started would it taste like coffee yet i definitely would not be drinking this one yet it's going to be very what we call underdevelop it'll probably just smell it's probably taste and smell like popcorn here we are at like 380 fahrenheit and after this something dramatic happens after about seven minutes the remaining water is drawn into the very center of the beam that moisture will build up so much pressure inside the middle of the beam that will escape and and do what we call first crack literally cracked open with this roasting machine that happens at like 395 fahrenheit and now it's coffee the remaining roast phase is called development this one harry is going to take to like a medium roast he is dropping it at 425 fahrenheit about 10 minutes in just like a steak or anything that you're cooking it is still being roasted or cooked once it's dropped we want to stop that immediately that's exactly what's happening here a fan draws ambient air through the beans as they stir around you can brew that now but it would still taste a little popcorny it's still off gassing that's what the little valve on these bags is for is to let the gas out just like a fine wine you want to let it let it air out a little bit it's the same thing with coffee we like to give it about 24 to 48 hours to kind of breathe to really get those amazing flavors to come out so now what if harry had kept going to maybe 450 fahrenheit there's a first crack is there a second you take the coffee even longer even darker there will be a second crack and those would be definitely a very very dark dark roast there yeah and that's the real intense stuff right the real tough guy coffee actually no not at all so the difference between light all the way to dark is really how much acidity bitterness and sweetness you're going to be experiencing in in that coffee the lighter the roast the more acidic the coffee so no surprise that's a hit with me it's because we haven't roast out any of those organic chemicals or any of those characteristics that will give it that acidity lighter roasts also preserve more of the polyphenols the antioxidants in coffee they're probably quite good for you the acids the phenols they're all breaking down with heat as you take the roast even darker um you're gonna introduce a lot more bitter flavor so you're gonna go from say a milk chocolate kind of taste profile to say the dark chocolate and then start introducing some almost smoky almost uh woody or even earthy flavors as you take the coffee even darker and if you care about such things the caffeine starts to break down at much higher temperatures as well says science there have been studies on this there's links in the descriptions very dark roasts can have a lot less caffeine the more important thing is dark roasts can taste really good but they taste like the roast whereas a light roast tastes like the bean when you're buying really special stuff like the coffees trade will find for you i think it's worth being open to a lighter roast for that reason alone but hey it's you're a cup of joe so be honest with trade when you take the quiz and they will send you something that you're really gonna love and you can be pretty confident that it's been ethically sourced all the roasters have to sign a pledge about that and here is my pledge to you the first hundred of you who follow my link in the description will get fifty percent fifty percent off your first bag with

watching thank you remember do you and me both a favor by using my link and code in the description to get half off and remember that great coffee roasts come in many colors none of which are just for

***RECIPE,...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.186359, here's a darn satisfying brinner that's breakfast for dinner home fries with a bunch of peppers and an over easy egg this recipe is so fast and efficient that i had to set up multiple cameras because i won't have time to reset for every shot it goes that fast first thing is to get the potato par boiling i've tried this with tons of potatoes a russet comes out on top every time that's a flowery variety this big one will feed at least two people and i'm not peeling it the skins are quite tasty when you fry them up crisp as we shall home fries are traditionally cuboid not long bars and you could do bigger chunks than these but smaller ones cook faster and i'm all about speed today drop them in some water boiling home fries before you fry them makes them cook way faster the outsides come out crispier the inside's fluffier heat on high and a common trick is to put a little vinegar in the water just a touch this slows the breakdown of pectin in the potatoes and helps them hold their shape when you fry them later while we wait we can slice our vegetables love peppers with home fries and i've been loving this trick where you hold the bell pepper by its stem and fillet it like a fish ooh this one had some baby peppers inside you monster then you can just mow each of these segments into thin slices and you get these really pretty little pieces that cook really fast and they're really easy to eat on the plate speaking of fast green onions the most convenient form of onion question mark all i'm doing is rinsing them and peeling off any outer layers that seem dry and tattered or decayed and slimy take it over here trim off the roots then i'll cut the whites into big chunks that seem like they'll cook in the same time as my pepper slices once i get up into the greens i'll set those aside for later oh one more pepper a serrano thin slices with the ribs intact just for a little heat if you don't want it spicy don't do this potatoes are boiling now if you put in a ton of vinegar in the water the trick works a little too well they take forever to cook just a splash works fine this meal is possible in a well-seasoned cast iron but i keep a non-stick around exactly for a day like today heat on high yeah that's fine with teflon as long as you have a lot of food in the pan to absorb the energy and keep the coating from overheating and sending off dangerous gas just a touch of olive oil all three stages of this meal will involve fat in the pan if you don't watch the oil quantity you'll end up with a pretty greasy plate at the end i'll hit these with salt and pepper not because they have to be seasoned in isolation from the potatoes but mostly just so i can visually keep track of how much salt total i need to put in the dish and a splash of vinegar this gives the final plate a needed hit of acidity and i wonder if it keeps the veggies a little crisper when they just have a little color on them and they're just starting to soften like two minutes in there i'll turn the heat off and stow those on a plate they'll keep softening as they sit you can fry the veg with the potatoes but it's way easier to control if you do them one at a time plus we were just sitting here anyway waiting for the potatoes to soften which they have i can just barely pierce them with a fork that's enough drain them i usually do this through the pot lid to save on dishes back over here in our pan i'll turn the heat on medium high some more olive oil and a little butter not because this lowers the smoke point of the butter i'm pretty sure that's crazy talk it's just that the butter plus olive oil tastes good also if the butter does burn there will be less of it i'll hit these with a bunch of salt so the salt can really fry into the crust and then i'll just let these sit if you let the first side brown really rigid it provides structural support to the rest of the piece as you stir things around later while we wait we can do a home try on from the sponsor of this video warby parker they provide awesome vision care online and in stores eye exams contacts whatever and glasses start at just 95 bucks including

home for free at warbyparker.com ragusa thanks warby parker now give these a stir and you can see why pro brunch cooks love to put a ton of acid in the boil water i'm having to be kind of ginger with my spoon but you put a lot of vinegar in the water and the pieces will be hard which has got to be great when you're flipping a giant pile of home fries on a flat top griddle you can be brutal with them i can afford to give these a little more love and affection since i have nothing else to do right now and the bits that get mashed up like that are the ones that are going to go super crisp if you give them enough oil to fry in if you want to use all butter for the flavor i'd recommend using clarified butter whole butter will be likely to burn and won't get the potatoes as crispy i like the olive oil flavor while they're going we can slice our onion greens nice and thin if you want that sexy diagonal cut you have to get it started which results in some waste so flip these around keep the waste up here where the tops are too dry and fibrous to eat anyway that's no skin off our backs reason 35 why i love green onions is they're a two-for-one deal you get your onion at the white end and you get your fresh herb at the green end will scatter those raw on the plates back at the potatoes people often put paprika and garlic powder and such in these just be careful because those kinds of spices burn really easily at these temperatures when they're brown to my liking i will turn off the heat and then dump in my veg to warm up now that it's safer i'll put in my spices i'm using harissa powder the dry version of the traditional north african chili garlic paste super tasty with the potatoes will moisture in the vegetables make the fries a little less crispy yeah a bit if you want really crisp home fries don't do vegetables with them but for the flavor and the nutrition i'm happy to make that trade off on this goes to my plates way too hot to eat right now which is perfect because we still need to cook our eggs a little oil just to be super duper safe that was too much crack in the eggs and my heat is still off there's the perfect amount of residual heat in the pan and the burner to cook these eggs if you're using a cheaper thinner pan or a gas burner you might have to turn the heat back on low just keep the eggs bubbling gently and for an over easy egg this is the sign i look for see how the white has two distinct regions there's the flat outer skirt and then there's another layer of white up above it around the yolk when i see that upper layer just starting to go opaque the egg is usually solid enough to flip safely you just kind of do it swiftly and with some confidence even if you have to fake your confidence for over easy eggs they need like 30 seconds max on the flip side i finally had to move some lights and such for this last shot so my eggs were on the flip side for maybe a minute and they came out more like over medium yoke is still runny but not quite as runny as i'd like it's fine if you want the yolk firm just cook it until it feels firm when you poke it easy i think this meal costs like two or three dollars a plate in terms of ingredients and it's fit for a king make brynner happen at your house tonight,3
The argument for eating bison (buffalo) meat,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fUH1QVtIdp4/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLBTuFM318tdek0TUM1vdQcSVeEVyw,fUH1QVtIdp4,"11 minutes, 43 seconds","Thanks to Crowd Cow for sponsoring this video!

M. Scott Taylor's 2007 working...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.186359, this video is sponsored by crowd cow somewhere on the internet recently i was talking about how various species of meat animal were introduced to the americas by european colonists cattle chickens pigs sheep none of them are native to here they were all introduced from europe and this prompted some reply guy to be like wait a minute did native americans have any animals to eat at all until europeans so generously brought them over and the answer is yeah bro they did until people killed them all unimaginably vast herds of bison once grazed across the north american interior scholars put the population at about 30 million around the time that lewis and clark showed up and reported heard so huge that they quote darkened the whole planes lewis and clark of course called them buffalo which scientists now regard as a misnomer for no particularly good reason the terms were used interchangeably for centuries but over the years science has settled on using buffalo to describe this one genus and bison to describe another genus within the same sub-family at the species level you've got the european bison and the american bison two subspecies of the american bison are the wood bison in northwestern canada and this guy a plane's bison actually i think this is a lady bison small horns narrow head whoa whoa she's laid here in the u.s plains bison are living symbols of the great american west bison were the source of subsistence for people of the great plains for millennia like other ruminants bison take a virtually inexhaustible energy source that humans cannot digest grass and they convert that into proteins and fats that we can live on in the eastern u.s like here in georgia the bison decline happened relatively gradually over the course of a couple centuries human european population was virtually all concentrated in the east and europeans and native people alike hunted bison for meat it's easy to see why each of these animals will yield around a quarter ton of meat what's it like well bison or bovines just like domestic cattle so the meat basically tastes like beef though we should keep in mind that today's bison gene pool has some domestic cattle swimming around in it american bison and cattle interbreed very easily and the resulting hybrids are known amusingly as beefalo surely this happened incidentally from animals just getting freaky in the fields but bison ranchers have also done some deliberate cross breeding to get more beef-like characteristics from the meat all of this is to say i'm not sure what bison meat used to taste like but this is still different from beef in some noticeable ways most obviously it is very lean hardly any intramuscular fat even in this strip steak almost looks like tuna right as with any super lean red meat you probably want to cook it on the rare side or you want to push past the very tough well done phase and braise it until it is soft this right here is bison stew meat a real vidalia onion straight from the field brown my bison bits a bit squeeze a tomato paste you know there's gonna be some white wine any meat juice left in the package season let it simmer for a couple hours you put in some carrots potatoes cook until just tender and baby you got a stew going totally delicious but not my favorite way to have bison i'll show you my favorite before we're done here for now let me show you where i got this beautiful sustainably farmed meat crowd cow the sponsor of this video crowd cow is a marketplace for high quality meats that helps you connect with farmers raising gorgeous stuff the right way that foam dissolves in water everything else is recyclable and even though this shipment was delayed a day the dry ice has kept these rock solid that's a bison flank stick thaw in the fridge overnight or in trickling cool water these steaks were ready in 20 minutes don't be scared of frozen meat you want to get stuff from boutique producers it's gonna be frozen and that's just fine whether it's bison grass-fed beef pastured chicken sustainable seafood anything special you could want is here and you can read all about

means five percent off everything check it out thank you crowd cow and here's a bison strip steak cooked medium rare delicious though still not my favorite way to have bison lauren's never had bison let's see what she thinks no it really tastes like steak and pork had a baby and we ate the baby yeah i think the leanness of this is reminiscent of loin cuts from modern domestic pigs also like good pork there is a sweetness to this a freshness that is different from beef but lovely you taste that and you can see why people would hunt these animals to the brink though alas this sad story is about a lot more than just food native american hunters started hunting a lot more when they found they could harvest heavy winter furs these are known as buffalo robes and they could exchange those robes with european traders for various european goods native people were also able to hunt bison far more efficiently as they acquired european firearms and the colonists themselves regarded bison as an agricultural pest they trampled and ate crops and they competed for water and pasture with introduced livestock few euro americans wept when hunting and habitat destruction either killed or drove away every known wild bison east of the mississippi by the 1830s but again that was a relatively gradual process the bison that lived west of the mississippi were annihilated in the space of just about a decade starting in the early 1870s the reasons for this are multiple but a big theme is railroads post-u.s civil war it was time for westward expansion via railroad and bison herds literally got in the way as did native peoples fighting for the very existence of their nations the solution to both problems according to famous civil war general william tecumseh sherman was to kill every bison in the west i think it would be wise to invite all the sportsmen of england and america there this fall for a grand buffalo hunt and make one grand sweep of them all until the buffalo and consequently indians are out from between the roads we will have collisions and trouble it was explicit u.s military strategy to wipe out the ancestral food supply of tribes on the great plains that is the assertion made by historian david smith's in the 1990s and his theory had its detractors more recently the canadian economist m scott taylor argued that military policy was indeed part of what happened but the railroads also furthered the slaughter in other ways the workers laying all those endless tracks needed food so rail tycoons hired hunters like the famous buffalo bill cody to ride out and procure bison meat for the men and once they were built the railroads brought in sport hunters in their droves enchanted by the wild west mythology that bison represented some of these sport hunters shot out of their train car windows and waved goodbye to the carcasses as they just went past it is said and here's what taylor thinks was the biggest factor railroads also enabled bison products to be shipped back east a business that exploded in the 1870s when tanners invented a new chemical process for making bison leather native people of course had figured this out long ago by using their brains well actually the bisons brains they would use the lecithin emulsifier naturally found in brain to oil and dry the hides into soft pliable leather the traditional process was too laborious for industrial production but once european and american tanners figured out their own process global demand for bison leather skyrocketed it was tougher than cow leather so the brits wanted it for the souls of shoes for their soldiers expanding their empire and with the industrial revolution whirring along bison leather was the perfect belting material for the wheels in the mills hunters harvested the hides and left the meat to fester by the 1880s the american bison was virtually gone a few ranchers held on to some very tiny herds almost as novelty items conservationists like teddy roosevelt wanted to preserve the bison for all of that wild west mythology that it signified the u.s and canadian national park systems were created in large measure as bison preserves from that low point of just a few hundred animals in the 1880s we are now back up to maybe 30 000 wild american bison that's the biggest estimate that i've seen far more american bison maybe half a million are alive and kicking today on ranches where they are raised as livestock for meat delicious relatively low cal low cholesterol red meat there's a compelling argument that the resurgence of bison meat is good for conservation think about it what is the most numerous large land animal on the planet it's us humans are we so numerous because we are just such ferocious apex predators no it's because we're really really smart now think about what the second most numerous large animal may be land animal it's domestic cattle are they so numerous because they're evil geniuses too nah here's a cow i saw the other days feudally dry humping another cow while simultaneously pooping geniuses they ain't cattle are numerous because we consume them and or their milk you could argue that the way to keep bison numerous is to do the same with them this is precisely the argument made by the man who has owned more head of bison than anyone else alive you probably know his name he's famous i'll give you a second to think about it it's ted turner the mouth of the south pioneer of cable television founder of cnn and other channels and noted outdoorsmen ted turner probably more than anyone else has personally brought bison meat back and with it the bison itself that was his stated intent now the debate is whether that's a good trade people like bison because they are wild is it the same animal if it lives like cattle grazing on an enclosed ranch may be spending its last months fattening up in a feedlot just like cattle is that the bison we want to preserve i don't know i could argue it either way what i know for sure is that i really do like eating it and here let me show you my favorite way to have it this bison strip loin looks like tuna so let's cook it like tuna trim a couple of tidy little pieces sear them really hot and fast just to get some nice flavor and kill any surface pathogens take them out while they're still totally raw on the inside and slice thin just like tuna tataki if you use the lakota word for bison it would be tatanka tataki so i think this was meant to be run that through a little soy sauce it's almost as soft as raw tuna it is incredibly delicious and as good a reason as any to keep bison around,3

***TUNA SALAD***

pouched or canned tuna,...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.186359, a chopped cold protein bound in something creamy usually mayonnaise flavored with some other stuff and usually eaten as a sandwich filling that is what salad means in this context for those who didn't grow up eating this for lunch all the time it's one of my favorite things to eat especially the egg salad i'm going to show you that i'm going to show you tuna salad and chicken salad and hopefully give you some ideas about how you can play with the basic concept lots of ways to be creative here basic tuna salad first these days you have the can or you have the pouch either is fine but if you use the can you have to drain it first they have to add way more water or oil to get a good seal inside the can i always just squeeze the lid into the can to wring out the water the vacuum pouch has hardly any water in it why not just cook fresh tuna for this i don't know it seems like kind of a waste for something so special as fresh tuna this whole sandwich evolved as a way to make the cheap canned stuff palatable i say go with it and the mayonnaise works great because the fish is so lean i always just eyeball a few scoops at first you can mix in more later for onion to me this is so a job for shallots i want the crunch so i want to use a lot of onion and relatively big pieces shallots are mild so you can do that without completely blowing your head off with onion steak my parents always used the dried onion flakes or a powder from a bottle this is the secret i didn't learn until i moved to the south sweet pickle relish when my time comes bury me with this it makes everything amazing it might improve chocolate chip cookies it definitely makes tuna salad to die for grind in a bunch of pepper and i believe my love of garlic powder might have begun with this meal my folks always use that with the dried onion and no salt yet the tuna is usually pretty salty stir stir stir and oh i forgot the celery so good in these cold salads some people dice it i like to do thin slices across the whole stock i want that crunch to contrast with the soft fish and the creamy dressing and that goes and since you have it you might as well grab some of those leaves from the celery they taste amazing and they'll be pretty and green in here have a little taste yeah that needs a little salt but not much and for me i like the quantity of mayo in there but i think most people would find that a little dry i'll mix some more in lettuce is always nice to put on the sandwich if you have it and i quite like tomatoes if you've never had tuna salad soaked in sweet pickle relish before get ready for your life to change my friend so good and it's such a great thing to mix up in advance and eat for lunch for the next few days same deal with the egg salad we always make it with a whole dozen eggs first you gotta hard boil them some people say add vinegar and or salt to the boil water they say this will make the shell easier to peel i've never noticed the difference what has made a difference that i've noticed is dropping the eggs into already boiling water that seems to make the white pull away from the shell a bit oops i cracked one there it doesn't matter cover so it comes back up to a boil real fast and a chef friend of mine told me that 14 minutes is the ideal time for hard boiled it seems to work great and that gives me plenty of time to head out to the garden and catch up on the world of business finance and tech with morning brew the sponsor of this video hey like my wheat i used to work in the news business and i'm quite glad that i don't anymore it's very bad for the digestion but the flip side is now basically the only way that i stay informed about anything is by endlessly doom scrolling on twitter which is also bad for the digestion so morningbrew morningbrew is a free daily newsletter all the news i need about money and tech and such is here such as what even is an nft and should i spend tens of thousands of dollars on one i mean everybody else is apparently morning brew is written for busy people and laid out for busy people each newsletter is super skimmable and the copy is funny and fun there's no reason to not subscribe to morningbrew it's free in your email and takes less than 15 seconds to sign up for do us both a favor and sign up using my link morningbrood.comadamr or click the link in the description thank you morningbrew now 14 minutes is up a lot of people would pull these out to an ice water bath with a slotted spoon or a spider or something a much easier option i think is to just drain through the pot lid drop it in the sink and spray them with cool water it doesn't matter if the water isn't ice cold between the convection and the water being constantly replaced as the pot spills over these eggs are going to be cooled off in no time yeah this uses some water but so would washing the big bowl that you used for the ice bath okay lauren is going to take this one from here she's an ace with egg salad she just smacks the egg all over with the back of a spoon focusing on the bottom where there's usually a little hollow she flips the spoon around pushes the edge up under the shell there nice that one came off all in one piece yeah give each one a rinse and repeat and for egg salad you're going to be chopping it all up into little bits anyway so who cares if you take a chunk out of the side of one of these get them all over to the cutting board and slice them in half lauren's approach to egg salad is inspired by deviled eggs and with deviled eggs you push all the cooked yolks out into a bowl and then you smash them smooth with your mayonnaise and such i think you end up needing almost equal parts mayo and egg yolk but she's smart to be conservative up front you can always add more in the south they dump in a ton of sweet pickle relish which is why southern deviled eggs are so much better also great in deviled eggs is a sinus clearing quantity of mustard a little salt and pepper and if you taste this now just remember that it needs to be strong enough to flavor all of this bland protein over here so it should be too strong for deviled eggs you would pipe the filling preciously back into each egg half it's much easier to just dice each of these up and dump them in the yellow stuff and because this is egg salad not deviled eggs i think that you want a fair bit of crunchy stuff in there an egg salad sandwich is so soft and mushy unless you have some fresh onion or again in this case some coarsely chopped shallot and i would use celery but lauren hates celery so how about some cucumber a nice mild taste won't drown out the subtle taste of the egg just tons of fresh watery crunch i usually leave some peel on it for color cut a half in half and then i'll kind of do three or four radial cuts so that i can now really easily get triangular thin slices again the goal is crunchy texture so i think it's nice to have wide pieces those are really going to freshen up this salad lauren thinks she put in too much salt let's have a taste now i think the salt is great but i'm going to want more shallot in there the onion flavor mellows as this sits in the fridge so i try to overshoot it that cucumber released some water overnight so if you use that and maybe undershoot the moisture a bit another good way to contrast the soft texture is to toast your bread lightly toast it if the toast is too rigid you'll squish the pieces together with your teeth and end up squeezing the salad out the sides like toothpaste i think egg salad is easier to eat on little rolls speaking of delicious things they introduced me to here in the south very nice okay let's talk chicken salad my folks used to use canned chicken but i think this is a perfect occasion to use a grocery store rotisserie chicken they're absurdly cheap they taste pretty good and they're soft so you can just pull the meat apart into chunks into the bowl whenever you're picking meat to mix into some other stuff i think you want to start with chunks that feel a little too big remember they're going to break apart and shred a bit as we stir them in with everything else the white meat on these chickens tends to be pretty dry but who cares we're going to cover this in mayo actually let's use something else this time a fancy alternative is mascarpone cheese italian cream cheese two problems though mascarpone is a little too thick and it can be kind of hard to find the solution to both issues is to make our own like two cups of whipping cream a pint four or five hundred mils medium heat just barely bring it up to a simmer and then juice in a lemon at least half a lemon for this much cream i ended up using the whole thing you'll see the acid instantly coagulate the cream and thicken it up to make mascarpone you would now put this in a cheesecloth and let it drain overnight but we would then have to thin it out with water or milk to get it loose enough to coat the chicken so let's just not do any of that let's just call this done here it is after it cools down a delicious spread in its own right and you may think wow that's pretty indulgent putting cream into chicken salad but i mean what is this now maybe 60 percent fat at this point mayo is like 95 percent fat so this is actually the light option and darn tasty and say you don't want to use shallots a bunch of green onions works great for all the same reasons mild flavor when raw a little crunch but not too much i did thin slices down at the firm white end and i'm doing progressively bigger pieces as we get up into the greens which are more like a fresh herb we get some nice green color in there to boot say you don't want to use the sweet pickle relish again how about some sweet corn shave off of kernels and you've got a hit of sugar that really helps this what you don't get from the corn is any acid fruit has acidity and sweetness which is why a lot of people use apple in chicken salad or grapes like these are very nice half is going to be too big i'm gonna go quarters there we go these will give us the brightening that we would get from the relish unfortunately grapes are soft and i want even more crunch so nuts any kind these are pistachios love them once you get them out of their shells you do probably want to smash them or chop them a bit not too much the whole point is to have some texture in there pepper a little bit of salt to start with rotisserie chickens are already pretty salty a little parsley is nice if you've got it and give this a preliminary stir i can see that i'll probably need the rest of my thickened acidified cream whatever you want to call it the lemon in there really freshens up the taste of the chicken oh and i forgot my garlic powder the best that's some pretty fancy stuff as chicken salad goes the one hitch is the cream really stiffens up in the fridge a virtue of mayo is that it's pretty much the same consistency at any temperature the cream you might want to let warm up a bit before you eat it but man is it tasty and any of these ideas could transfer to any of the other recipes mix up a bowl and have lunch taken care of for the next three or four days,3
"Can we taste more than just bitter, salty, sour, sweet and umami?",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JdeYqR2YUR0/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLDplUP8VXZH1S_aFfgWWY5BRhWiSg,JdeYqR2YUR0,"13 minutes, 33 seconds","Thanks to Skillshare for sponsoring this video!

Thanks to Dr....",2022-12-01 14:47:05.186359, this video is sponsored by skillshare bitter salty sour sweet umami is there nothing more there may indeed be according to emerging science there could be a sixth basic taste and a seventh and an eighth our taste buds may be able to perceive certain kinds of fat certain kinds of carbs beyond just sugar certain minerals beyond just salt and maybe even water itself we're going to look at the evidence for all of those and now you might be thinking wait a minute of course i can taste fat and carbs fat and carbs are my favorite tastes well you gotta remember the difference between taste and flavor flavor is the combined experience that we get via a few distinct sensory systems we smell the food as well as we taste the food because those things happen at the same time we people find it very difficult to separate the two this is dr carl philpott professor of rhinology and olfactology at the university of east anglia yeah people inevitably will feel like they kind of you know taste these things ordinarily and and and fatty foods or you know something like cream i guess or something like that that's got a fat content and they will say yeah i can i can taste that but it's probably you know a large part of that's obviously the smell of it and our smelling system is way more sophisticated than our other taste perception systems by some estimates we can smell over a trillion distinct odors most of the detail that we experience in food and drink is smell and there's other things too like the hot sensation we get from chili and the cool sensation we get from mint that's called chemists and some people consider that to be part of flavor then there's astringency which is that kind of dry feeling you get in your mouth from red wine or from certain unripe fruits some people consider that to be part of flavor too personally i'd lump it in with texture a taste is certainly part of flavor but strictly speaking taste is only this thing that we experience via these receptors called taste buds that are in our mouth and at the very top of our throat most taste buds are on our tongues taste is pretty much what you sense on your tongue and it happens when certain substances fit into those receptor cells like a key into a lock in simplistic terms you know the receptor has a sort of certain shape and the thing that come in you know the molecule he's trying to pick up has a shape that fits within that um and then when when those two things sort of fit together that sort of enables some uh what we call a g-coupled protein sort of reaction to occur inside the cell it causes a whole biochemical chain of events to unfold that ultimately opens up a pathway to your brain when sugar for example hits one of your taste buds it effectively completes the circuit that lights up the sweetness bulb in your brain for the existence of a taste modality as they say to become broadly accepted scientists like dr philpot want to see basically two things they want to see what is the actual physical receptor pathway that the substance is kind of acting on and then they want to see whether people are aware of what they get via that pathway and they can assess the latter by a couple of methods they can look at like responses inside people's brains or they can you know like talk to people this is how scientists prove the existence of umami starting with japanese chemist kikunai ikeda in the early 20th century it's an event somewhat infamously dramatized in a corny video made by the company ikeda went on to co-found ajinomoto the original producer of msg as the story goes ikeda's wife tay made the family a dashi broth and while tasting it he had an epiphany he thought this is doing something to my tongue that is totally distinct from sweet sour bitter or salty [Laughter] would you run to the grocery for me i want dried kombu they're not open this late please tay just go and get what you can this is crazy please dude how about you go to the store are your legs broken anyway scientists later proved that amino acids called glutamates form a key that can fit into the lock of a few different receptor types in the taste buds that's the biochemical pathway proven they also had to prove that people are actually aware of it and that's a little more complicated our way of verbalizing what we experience is entirely determined by our cultural context right not everybody has the literal vocabulary for umami if you went to japan for instance obviously where the term came from people were very much familiar with that as a concept a colleague of mine did a survey of the local population in switzerland and asked them just to describe when given monosodium glutamate what it was they were tasting and there were about 40 different things they came out with so i mean for example i know what umami is but when i put straight msg on my tongue i could swear that it tastes kinda sweet not just meaty or savory or other words that people use to describe things like umami but it tastes sweet to me is that my nature or my nurture so you've got the cultural complexity on one hand and the biochemical neurological complexity on the other all of this explains why there could be scientific controversy over such a seemingly simple question like can we taste fat but here's the evidence for that one oleogustus some scientists are calling it and it's not the taste of fat per se but rather free fatty acids most of the lipids that we actually eat from oils and animal fats these are triglycerides three fatty acids those are the long squiggly things all stuck to one glycerol that's the short line on the end there now we definitely perceive triglycerides we feel them that is one source of creamy texture in the mouth however both human and animal studies have indicated an ability to taste free fatty acids fatty acids that have been broken off from that glycerol the breakdown of triglycerides into free fatty acids is something that happens to food as it ages and it spoils as a result people seem to have evolved to find lots of free fatty acid taste and or smell to be repulsive especially certain kinds of fatty acids that result from spoilage but triglycerides also break down another way in your mouth i mean obviously saliva in the mouth does allow for um some initial sort of breakdown of molecules uh um through initial digestion so um you know that we know that that's where the sort of uh digestive process starts this is pure speculation on my part but i do wonder if this is maybe one of the reasons why chocolate can be so much more delicious if you just let it melt slowly on your tongue particular types of fatty acids that are freed by the enzymes in your saliva seem to taste good particularly good to certain people or again mice tons of things that we think we know about people are really things that we know about mice because mice are easier to study here's a study where scientists found that mice who had more of these certain kind of taste receptors demonstrated a preference for foods containing oleic acid and linoleic acid there's also a human study where they put nose clips on people and then they diluted their samples into these viscous liquids to kind of hide the texture of the samples and the people were able to tell the difference between samples that contained linoleic acid and samples that didn't one reason why the fatty taste is not yet broadly accepted maybe that not everybody has it taste preferences are not just people being fussy people are born with different tasting hardware and at least some people's taste hardware might be able to detect starchiness as well this is a very new area of research spearheaded by dr jaiyun lim at oregon state university she and colleagues have done these experiments where they gave people a compound that blocks their sweetness receptors and the people were still able to taste carbs carbohydrates are just different arrangements of sugars simple carbs taste sweet to us one sugar hanging out by itself or maybe two stuck together this is sucrose table sugar it's gonna taste sweet to us really really big amalgamations of sugars all stuck together complex carbs those do not fit into the lock the sweetness lock on our tongue however dr lim's research indicates that enzymes in people's saliva break complex carbs down into smaller carbs that people can taste even with their sweetness receptors turned off people describe it as like a bready taste or a flowery taste or a rice like taste but again that's relatively new research and as yet no one has identified any specific receptor that would pick up the starchy taste in contrast scientists have identified a specific taste receptor for calcium or at least they've spotted it in mice maybe we have it too and maybe that's why chalk has such a distinct taste yuck anyway people seem to be able to taste a few minerals not just calcium that's that's less well-defined really i mean a lot of people um are aware of sort of metallic tastes um i see a lot of people complain of metallic taste as a specific kind of you know symptom when they come to the clinic um i guess a lot of people will have the experience of maybe cutting their finger and sort of you know sucking their finger and thinking they get a metallic taste which you know could be the iron in the uh and the blood the hemoglobin sort of molecule contains iron at the center and that's all kind of empirically indisputable right the only question is what actually are we experiencing when we experience the taste of those minerals are they tastes in the traditional biochemical taste bud sense or is it something else going on maybe something electrical as has been hypothesized i think further research is required to kind of truly determine whether there is actually a metallic taste or whether it's just a sort of part of the chemical reaction that's happening in the mouth that we're experiencing and picking up on whether it's taste or smell or something electrical galvanism there is one place where we are definitely aware of mineral content and that is in water we've all had the experience of getting weird tastes from the tap as we travel from one place to another where the geology or the pipe systems introduce different minerals and metals and such into the water but you can get those things out via distillation distilled water and then you can do tests with it scientists have known for a long time that insects have a taste response to pure water and some of them are arguing now that mammals like us might have one as well i think this is based on sort of mouse uh sort of models and and the fact they appear to sort of potentially have a receptor or respond to sort of you know water as a discrete sensation and you may kind of think well that's pretty weird indeed every definition of water that you can find says right up front that it is tasteless it may be that the touch and temperature sensations that we get from water are simply way stronger and they drown out this relatively subtle taste sensation that we get from pure water as well or maybe it's a situation like umami where people certain groups of people simply have not developed the skill of articulating what they are tasting this is why something like wine tasting is regarded as a skill people practice disentangling the distinct sensory elements of the experience and then they learn names for those elements so they can communicate what they want i'm going to give

simple lasagnas you can assemble in minutes both built on dried lasagna noodles that we layer straight into the pan no boiling i'm calling this one lasagna ogratin and this one lasagna o tuesday it's shockingly good despite the fact that we're just gonna dump in a bunch of prepared ingredients the pan will be the only dirty dish and the biggest downside of not boiling your noodles is they have to fit whatever pan you're using you can break them but that's obviously not ideal this brand makes a shorter lasagna that fits right into a standard 8 inch or 20 centimeter square pan excellent we're not going to pre-cook a sauce so we cannot use whole canned tomatoes like that too much water in the can you want a can of crushed or ground tomatoes ideally a brand with particularly concentrated flavor this is the one i use for pizza sauce and it's perfect for this lasagna just a little bit goes in the bottom of the pan to keep the first layer of noodles wet and the way i'm going to do this is season each layer as it goes in a little olive oil just for flavor smoosh that around and then sprinkle in just a little salt canned tomatoes usually already have some salt in them and then i'm just shaking in rando italian herbs and spices garlic and onion powder since we don't have the fresh forms of either dried oregano basil marjoram parsley chili flakes you could just buy an italian seasoning blend but i am apparently too italian to own an italian seasoning blend because that makes sense first lasagna noodles are in and this is going to feel kind of weird but i'm going to sprinkle them with salt just a little salt the second biggest downside of not boiling your noodles is they won't be seasoned by the salty water so a little salt okay i've got one pound half a kilo of ricotta cheese the big benefit of ricotta as a filling is that it isn't terrible for you it's very high protein and even the whole milk kind is pretty low cal as cheeses go half of that container in and smoosh it out you might could top that with some grated mozzarella yes i'm using a pre-grated bag today it's tuesday nona i don't have time for your judgment you see what else i'm doing i'm reaching for the green can of grated ostensible parmesan just let me live my life noodles on and then that sprinkling of salt you could just strategically over season your sauce and depend on it to donate salt to the pasta but with this recipe i'm not pre-mixing anything and i'm not really tasting anything i'm just eyeballing and seasoning each layer one by one allows me to keep track visually of how much total salt i need to put in plus maybe the pasta gets seasoned a little bit better if it's in immediate proximity to those dissolved grains no idea but there's the rest of my ricotta and leave yourself enough mozzarella to melt on the top later fourth and final pasta layer sprinkle with salt i always try to finish with sauce on top we need that sauce to keep everything wet i ended up using like 80 percent of that standard 28 ounce 800 gram can herbs and spices maybe a little bit more olive oil for good measure and seal tightly with foil got to keep that steam trapped in there to cook the pasta in the oven at 350 fahrenheit 180c that's a little cooler than my normal lasagna temperature but we need to cook this one a little slower to let that pasta soften before anything starts drying out 45 minutes later here we are time to top with the reserved mozzarella and back this goes for 15 minutes uncovered i want to give excess water a chance to evaporate it's been in for an hour total and now i will turn on my top element my broiler to brown the cheese once you turn that on don't walk away it'll only take a couple of minutes and could burn real fast let this cool and solidify at least 15 minutes i'd say before cutting and scooping a little fresh basil cheers that up and if you want it to look a little neater bake it the night before and chill it whole in the fridge the next day it'll be firm and you can cut it really cleanly reheat in the oven and here's the trick that i just figured out maybe you already knew it sit the pieces on just a little splash of water cover with foil and then the water keeps the whole thing from drying out but especially that bottom layer of pasta after 15 minutes it's ready to eat but you can freshen up how it looks by melting on a little more mozzarella with your top element check out how tidy that looks you know i always say that you want to be careful about overcooking your pizza sauce otherwise your pizza will taste like lasagna this lasagna kind of tastes like pizza the sauce has not been cooked very much so it's really bright and fresh i kind of love it and the pasta is still pleasantly al dente because we didn't parboil it that is a tremendous weeknight home helper much like the sponsor of this video hello fresh america's number one meal kit lauren and i really do subscribe to hello fresh and we really do rely on it a few nights a week it's a life saver this meal has literally no chopping we didn't have to go to the grocery store and everything is pre-portioned which means much less food waste like purple cabbage is one of my favorite things but very rarely can i actually use the whole head that they sell at the store a university of michigan study found that the carbon footprint of a meal like this is 25 percent lower than something comparable you cook from groceries we usually get vegetarian boxes just to help us eat meatless more often but there are tons of different meal plans you can get meat no meat locale family friendly and the recipes are consistently tasty i pick up tricks from hello fresh meals that i use in my own recipes i am not ashamed to admit you want to try this go to hellofresh.com and use code adamragucia12 to get 12 free meals including free shipping 12 free meals with my link and code in the description thank you hello fresh now the second lasagna we're going to do is just as quick and easy if you have some frozen bolognese or other meat sauce in your chill chest i have a recipe linked in the description that i make all the time in huge batches and freeze but for the sake of demonstration let's make a quick meat sauce ourselves right now just for this lasagna an onion and a big carrot diced up pretty fine cut it into thin slices cut the slices into long sticks line the sticks up and mow them into little cuboids you could skip the carrot honestly i just like it a wide pan will cook this sauce quicker and it doesn't have to be terribly deep because we're only making enough for the lasagna i'm blasting my veg in a little olive oil on high heat keep it moving constantly and it will not burn until it's cooked off a ton of its water four or five minutes later and i see things are getting soft and dry enough now that they're starting to brown time to push everything out to the side and smash in my one pound or half a kilo of ground beef this is chuck you could totally use one of these fancy new soy protein fake meats instead my new favorite way to brown ground meat is just to push it out into a thin disc and then leave it there for a couple of minutes until i can really smell it going brown before it burns i'll start scraping it up and all the water that's going to come out of the rest of the meat should be enough to deglaze whatever is stuck to the bottom with a smash trick the amount of brown flavor i get is so great that i really don't have to worry about browning the rest of the meat in there i mean if i was browning several pounds of meat i'd keep frying until everything was really brown but with this much gnat i've got enough browning proportionally already so in goes a big squeeze of tomato paste to brown for just a second before it burns i'm going to deglaze with tomato water remember how i said cans of whole tomatoes have a ton of water in them there you go deglaze the pan with that and now that it's out of the can i can reach in there and just give everything a preliminary squish this will help the tomatoes cook more quickly once i get them in the pan a whole bunch of the aforementioned italian herbs and spices just a pinch of salt to start with we can taste for salt at the end reduce that heat to a simmer and let it go for as long as you have patience for here it is after an hour and i always like to say you can replace wine in recipes like this with a little balsamic vinegar this is white balsamic for cooking purposes it's basically white wine concentrate just a little splash for acidity and sweetness stir and taste for seasoning no more salt i like that it's done i'm going to make a lasagna twice as big this time i think these noodles should fit just barely yeah first thing i'm going to do is flood the pan with a thin layer of cream oh white on white that's great filmmaking ragusa bravo lasagna noodles on a sprinkling of salt just because i liked how well this seasoning method worked on my other lasagna and if you can be bothered to chop it up some fresh garlic goes really great with the cream i'll spoon on a layer of my meat sauce you know instead of a pound of ground meat you can make a great sauce with like 2 pounds of finely chopped mushrooms just cook the crap out of them to drive off the water and get them brown very nice a shake of parmesan just for kicks and another pasta layer sprinkle with salt and garlic and then more meat sauce and repeat i'm saving time by not bothering to make some kind of white sauce to alternate with my meat sauce just meat sauce alternated with pasta instead once i've built up my four layers i'm gonna pour in more cream the cream drips around and settles in different little pockets and when it cooks it flows to the top so the result is some of the heterogeneity you would normally get by building alternating layers but this is way less work i've got a pint of cream in there total 500 ml or so cover tightly with foil and bake as before 45 minutes at 180c uncover and that might not look very appealing but this is why the universe gave us melted cheese 15 minutes uncovered then flip on what brits called the grill to brown the top and look at the undulating waves that sprung up as the pasta cooked and expanded outward that's probably analogous to some geological process that results in rolling hills scoop it after a 15-minute rest and it'll look like this you bake raw cream with something starchy and it turns into a delicious sauce it works in a potato gratin it works in lasagna for a tidier presentation here we are cutting it after it's chilled sit the pieces in a little water to keep everything moist 15 minutes covered a little fresh cheese under the broiler for a sec and here we are right back where we started that's called a circular narrative works great in the movies,3
Do you have to boil lasagna noodles before baking?,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ukf3BVHcASc/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLAxB6ZDKvfCEs5EA20nps3SNGmbsw,ukf3BVHcASc,"11 minutes, 31 seconds","Thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this video!

squarespace yeah you do not have to pre-cook any kind of pasta for lasagna even dried pasta like this you can just layer them right into the pan with your other ingredients they will cook in the moisture of your sauce with dried noodles that comes out surprisingly good but of course just because you do not have to do something doesn't mean you do not want to you might still want to parboil your pasta even though it is kind of a pain i think it is particularly worthwhile with homemade fresh pasta but i think the reason people have such divergent opinions about this is because pretty much anything that you could do works and the resulting differences in the finished product are more subtle than you would expect or at least more subtle than i'd expect i'm gonna show you a whole bunch of test bakes that i did and i'm gonna try to describe how they tasted my sauce is just some fried off onions tomato paste browned a little in the pan and this brand of crushed tomatoes super good a little wine lots of herbs and spices simmer for at least an hour my cheese layer is grated mozzarella into a bunch of ricotta a bunch of grated parmesan eggs peppers salt mix it all up these are the standard italian-american lasagna fillings i'd say though we would often put ground beef in the sauce now in a way the most obvious choice of noodle here would be these fresh pasta sheets specifically formulated and shaped to go directly into a lasagna pan with no pre-cooking you can see they're more like semi-fresh they're stiffer and less sticky than real homemade fresh pasta my sense from watching tv is that brits and other europeans have had these for a long time i did not start seeing these in mainstream us supermarkets until a few years ago and it's usually in the refrigerator cases around the deli section and what could be easier right if you can get these it's a great weeknight dinner i'm just kind of underwhelmed by the taste and texture they come out a little gummy i'm not a huge fan let's go to dried pasta standard dry lasagna noodles this is the way my dad taught me to make lasagna i imagine how his italian mother taught him you par boil partially boil the noodles pretty much just until they are pliable maybe half or two thirds of the cooking time that they give on the package you then pull them out to ice water to stop the cooking if you don't shock them like this they tend to be way too soft in the end plus they'd stick together as they cooled all laid out on a towel and use another towel to dry off the top sides and then if you want you can trim them so they'll perfectly fit whatever size pan you're using and you don't have to throw those trimmings away fry them up in a pan with some butter fresh herbs top with some cheese very nice i usually start with a little sauce to keep the bottom layer of pasta from sticking or drying then for all these tests i'm doing one cup of sauce or cheese for each layer and building four total layers i'm just trying to keep everything standard to isolate the boiling variable top with some reserved mozzarella cover with foil for baking let's build an identical lasagna now with dry noodles the first problem that you're going to run into is that they aren't pliable so they have to perfectly fit the pan that you plan to bake them in if you don't you have to like snip off the end or break off the end which is kind of tricky to do without just like totally shattering this thing the best method that i came up with was to position one finger behind the line that i want to break across and then push outward still not great bend the noodle over your guide finger and that's better there same deal as before a cup of filling between each layer but here's an important caveat par boiling serves another important function which is to season the inside of the noodle you would normally boil it in salted water if your noodles were not made with much salt inside them and if you're not par boiling them then you have to over season your other elements they shouldn't be disgustingly salty but they should definitely taste a little too salty in isolation they are donating seasoning to all of this bland bulk that we are layering in i imagine that sealing with foil will be even more important here to trap the water the noodles need speaking of which i want to try a third lasagna where we put in some extra water the amount of water equivalent to the water that would have been absorbed if we had parboiled the pasta which for my lasagna here is approximately 144 grams apparently i'll measure out a little more than that because you're going to lose some to evaporation i probably could have just poured this water directly over the fully assembled lasagna before i baked it but to be safe i'll pour it directly onto each pasta layer as i build in little doses just to be sure that it's evenly distributed all three test lasagnas go into the oven at 400 fahrenheit 200c i'll uncover after about 40 minutes and give them a second dose of mozzarella on top 10 minutes later i'll flip on the top element the broiler to brown the cheese and then here we are par boiled raw with extra water raw with no extra water the difference is visually apparent the dry one looks drier though not in a bad way i don't think time to taste parboil noodles that feels like the lasagna i grew up with the pasta isn't exactly al dente but it isn't mushy either really nice here's raw noodles baked with extra water the noodles are noticeably firmer but not in a bad way raw noodles with no extra water here i am surprised by how little textural difference there is compared to the one we did with extra water the texture is virtually identical between them they're both pleasantly firm one difference that i did notice was a slightly more concentrated flavor in the dry lasagna which is hardly surprising the extra water that we added into this one diluted the flavor a little bit so next time i'll use salt water to me the real test of lasagna is how it tastes the next day because baked pasta dishes are almost always better reheated i try to make lasagna the day before i want to eat it so i can reheat it for 20 minutes in the oven and then boom this is the lasagna that we cooked totally dry the fact that the noodles were noticeably firmer yesterday means that they have held up better into today the noodle always softens a little bit with the reheating so i kind of think that was perfect one problem is the bottom layer of noodle is really dry and tough i can't cut through it with my fork i reckon there's some things we could do to prevent that problem though maybe bake it in a different kind of pan lower the temperature maybe bake it in a water bath we'll get back to that time now to repeat the experiment with real homemade fresh egg pasta eggs a glug of olive oil and flour whisk until you can whisk no more get in with your hands and knead until you can knead no more knead in basically as much flour as it'll take you want it smooth elastic and only slightly sticky cover and let rest in the fridge for a while so the flour can rehydrate time to roll and i think i'm going to be up late on this one good lord this is a hard job to do without a second person to help you feed it through for lasagna i go down to the second thinnest setting i'll trim these into the perfect size for my pan and store them on the ancestral fresh pasta storage system a clothes drying rack and not my finest work but hey it's going to be covered up in a lasagna so whatever just blast through them 12 noodles go into boiling water when you boil dry pasta you're making it softer when you boil fresh pasta you're making it firmer especially egg pasta you are setting that protein structure when all the noodles have visibly puffed up a bit and lightened in color out they come to the ice water get them all cooled down and separated from each other lay those out on a towel to dry it is so late i am so tired i love fresh pasta but it does not love me back i'll build my lasagnas exactly as before with a cup of filling in between all four layers time to repeat with the raw noodles look at how much smaller they are in there egg pasta puffs up so much when you boil it that one's all done and how much water did these absorb when boiled about the same proportion as the dry pasta a little math and i will supplement this one with a roughly equivalent amount of water salty water this time i learned my lesson for what it's worth i don't think that i would ever actually make lasagna like that if i wanted it a little bit wetter i would just not boil so much water out of my tomato sauce i'll bake these exactly as i did before could have gotten some better color on those but boiled raw with extra water raw and dry look at how much taller the boiled one is compared to the dry one though the boiled one shrank down as it cooled i guess that was steam puffing it up and that is very delicious the boiled fresh pasta homemade egg noodles man there is nothing like them now check out the raw noodles with extra water what a nice clean cut we got there same deal with the raw and dry one if i was cooking for instagram then clearly i would use the raw fresh egg noodles but because i'm cooking for my mouth nah the fact that those fresh raw noodles cut so smoothly is reflected in their texture they are a little brittle they're a little mealy the boiled fresh noodles were harder to cut because they are more elastic which i think is the way pasta should be now look if your family has been making lasagna with raw fresh egg noodles for generations and you love it please don't think that i'm trying to tell you you're wrong i mean this is just what i like i'm just here to tell you there definitely is a noticeable difference between boiled fresh noodles and lasagna and raw fresh noodles in lasagna though again there's hardly any difference at all between the one cooked with extra water and the one cooked dry that is interesting i just didn't really like either of them again there's just that kind of mealy texture those noodles also felt a little leathery to me in some spots and a little bit gummy in others not a fan if i'm going to go through the herculean effort of making fresh pasta from scratch for my lasagna i'm gonna do it the way i want it and the way that i want it is boiled and if you are bothered by that messy cut do the trick that i'm pretty sure a lot of restaurants use which is to chill the lasagna overnight it's now very firm and you can get a very clean cut on it reheat it covered for about 15 minutes uncover and then you can freshen up the appearance with a little more cheese on top melt and broil until brown and there you go a ton of work but i don't think lasagna gets much better than that however the fact that raw dry lasagna noodles got me such good results makes me wonder if i couldn't come up with a weeknight lasagna recipe that i would really

Here's the J. Kenji López-Alt article I mentioned about whether...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.186359, virtually every warm weather culture on earth has some version of red beans and rice this is the version from around where i live in the southern u.s cheap easy tasty and good for you it's the night before and i will soak my pound of beans half a kilo my preference is for small red beans also known as mexican red beans i like how they taste and they cook pretty fast but a lot of people use red kidney beans for this which are totally fine too i don't measure the water when i soak i just eyeball at least enough for them to double in size while staying submerged people have such divergent opinions about whether you should salt your soak water or put baking soda in there or put nothing in there i increasingly think this is because all of the common methods work they just do slightly different things today i'm trying our friend kenji's method where you soak in like 15 grams of salt per liter that's like two tablespoons of morton kosher for this much water he says this gets you creamier texture inside the beans here we are the next day if you cook in the soak water you'll get more vivid color but i'm going with kenji today who advises dumping it and even rinsing he says he gets better texture this way and there is some research that says dumping the soak water reduces certain undesirable digestive outcomes but it's prob not a big difference either way i go back and forth on the matter big pot on the stove coat it with olive oil and time for the holy trinity as they call it in louisiana onion bell pepper and celery i'm going with red everything for the color i like a medium dice on my veg for beans if the cooked pieces are too big they can feel kind of slimy if they're too small they end up effectively thickening the sauce and making it mushy instead of silky in those go a big bell pepper i'm doing the trick where you fillet off the sides of flesh that you do want seeds and stem are all that remain toss those again shooting for a medium dice on this for the same reasons as the onion then a couple of stalks of celery the easy way to dice these is to cut them in half lay each half on its back lay your knife securely inside that channel and then cut each one into like three long bars do that to all of them and then you can line them up in one big stack and chop through super nice medium dice celery is one of the vegetables i've been advised to eat for the purpose of feeding my gut microbiome which i just had analyzed by the sponsor of this video thrive let's thank them the science on gut health is still emerging but there is mounting evidence that beneficial microorganisms in your digestive tract affect basically everything your immune system your weight your mood everything and modern diet and lifestyle are probably bad for the gut in many ways if you're having serious problems i think you should talk to your doctor but you can also order this kit from thrive

recommendations and if you want you can get personalized probiotics from thrive formulated for what your gut needs this is all legit here are the doctors do us both a favor and save 50 on your thrive test with my link in the description half off with my link thank you thrive now i'm just giving my trinity here a head start my heat is on high there's tons of water in here to evaporate out before anything will come close to burning as long as you keep stirring constantly when these seem half cooked maybe two thirds i'll squeeze in a tablespoon or two of tomato paste this brings red color and a lot of depth of taste sweetness and umami stir it in and it's filled with sugar so it's gonna burn if we don't get some other stuff in there fast all the beans and then some fresh water a lot of recipes call for chicken stock i think that's totally unnecessary we have a stronger source of meaty flavor coming in louisiana it'd probably be andouille sausage where i live in georgia a common choice would be this a smoked ham hock it's the very tip of the shank or tibia bone there's hardly any actual meat on it it's the part of the ham that people usually just use as a handle it's all skin and bone which makes it perfect for flavoring other things a smoked turkey leg would be great instead if you don't want to use any animal parts i'd suggest a spoonful of smoked paprika great stuff time for herbs and spices i'm doing a big shake of paprika mostly for color an even bigger shake of garlic powder a tiny shake of cumin too much and it'll taste more latin than i'm going for same deal on the oregano just a bit this to me is the defining herb of southern red beans and rice dried sage just a tiny pinch of salt for now the beans are already soaked in salt that ham hock is salty so be conservative i'm turning down the heat to like medium medium-low i don't like to cook beans at a full boil i suspect that makes more of them burst and stuff has a tendency to stick to the bottom of the pot and burn a simmer would just be too slow so i'm looking for a low boil or an aggressive simmer whether i put the lid on is chiefly determined by whether i'm worried i put in too much water or too little in this case i'm worried i put in too much so no lid let the steam evaporate i prefer lidless anyway it lets me keep an eye on things just stir this every now and then it should take like 45 minutes longer if you use kidney beans because they're bigger meanwhile i can get my rice going i'm doing brown rice since it's better for me and i actually prefer the taste i'm cooking it pasta style that is any large volume of excess water that i will drain away later for long grain rices i really believe in this method if your brown rice always comes out gummy try this it's foolproof i didn't even bother washing my rice all the excess free starch is going to drain away here's my beans after like 20 minutes yep i'm nervous i put too much water in there and my gravy is going to be too thin glad i left the lid off you cook your rice pasta style and there's no guesswork just fish out a few grains with a fork to drain the water and taste when you like the texture you're done this was done in like a half hour which is really fast for brown rice you could either drain really thoroughly in a sieve or just do that through the pot lid and then put it back on the hot burner uncovered for a few minutes to steam off any loose water there you go tender fluffy grains if i have any green herbs around like parsley or cilantro i like to tear those into my rice it just gives it another dimension but it's hardly necessary after like 45 minutes it's time to taste a bean and see if it's done they get a little firmer as they cool so i try to cook them until they're a little softer than i want them same deal with the gravy it'll thicken as it cools so it looks like i actually judged the water quantity exactly right but always be conservative you can always add more water you can't suck it back out i don't think this needs any more salt i am now going to do my little bean trick which is not traditional it's just awesome a tiny pinch of sugar a nutritionally minuscule amount for this much food and then a little splash of vinegar really just a tad of both i don't want to taste them per se i just want them to kind of make everything else taste a little more alive my heat is off now by the way that's why the gravy is thickening that ham hock has a couple good bites of meat on it you could gnaw on it if you wanted or you could probably freeze it and flavor another pot of beans with it i only made enough rice there for two portions by the way half a cup of dry rice i'm gonna freeze the rest of my beans for later and for garnish again i don't think this is traditional but since you've got the celery why not reach in and grab some of the celery leaves these are an amazing fresh herb and there's one more key ingredient you know if i wasn't going to douse this in a vinegar-based hot sauce i would probably put a little more vinegar in with the beans i think beans almost always need a lot of brightening just put the acid in at the end acid at the beginning makes beans cook super slow our pot is gonna give us like six or eight portions so there's plenty to freeze into ice cube trays now you can thaw out exactly how much you want for a weeknight meal and have it with fresh rice that brown rice though is quite good for the digestion speaking of which don't forget to save 50 on your gut health test with my thrive link in the description you know i'm originally from up north so i didn't grow up eating beans and rice but somehow that just tastes like home no matter where home is or what they eat there tastes like home can't explain why,3

Thanks to Benjamin...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.187352, you can make an extremely satisfying dinner-sized chicken caesar salad by simply roasting the chicken on top of bread the bread becomes the croutons chicken fat croutons get yourself any kind of baking tray for four meal size portions i'd say at least a pound and a half 700 grams of skin on bone-in dark meat chicken pieces thighs are my preference but you could use legs i'll show you what those would look like i would not attempt to do this with breast meat white meat would turn into chalk with this method enough olive oil to coat a ton of salt we're seasoning more than just the chicken here and a ton of pepper i like some dried sage on roast chicken too and only because i'm already going to be using it in the dressing i might as well grate in the zest of this lemon i have tossed to get everything really well coated and then bread like half a pound of any bread 225 grams this is stale leftover bread which is of course what croutons were originally invented to utilize and i have torn it into a couple of big flat boats upon which we'll sail my chicken pieces i'm trying to get the bread as covered with chicken as possible and the chicken pieces are skin side up that's important my oven is already hot 350 fahrenheit 180c convection if you've got it the skin will keep the meat from drying out and the chicken will keep the bread from burning so you can just leave that in there for like an hour and a half this is easy but it's not quick halfway through you might move the pieces around just if you've got some bread that isn't covered in chicken you don't want that to burn so move the chicken on top and i just want to roast this meat until i can pull it apart like barbecue which of course only dark meat does now i guess i can just chill because i'm not making the dressing my friend ben is hey adam this is benjamin r harrison's famous caesar dressing that he talked about recently on his hugely popular star trek rewatch podcast it's called the greatest generation you should subscribe i write the music for them it's super goofy welcome to the greatest generation very simple this dressing is he's got a couple of big garlic cloves if you know anything about eating raw garlic you know that's gonna be a lot ben does not use the traditional mustard so the garlic is the pungency a big squeeze of mayonnaise that's in place of the traditional raw egg which squeezes a lot of people out please don't be skeezed out by the two anchovy fillets i swear this dressing will not taste fishy especially not with the juice of this lemon check been rolling it to bust up some of its internal structure thus making it easier to squeeze that's a big lemon even though it doesn't look like it because ben is a big man with big hands with a smaller lemon i'd use the whole thing he's using half maybe twice as much olive oil as he has lemon juice in there and then a shot of worcestershire sauce that brand is thickened with corn starch yours does not have to be thickened a pinch of salt just go easy at first the worcestershire sauce and the anchovies are very salty then a ton of pepper and hit it with a stick you could mince up the garlic and anchovies fine with a knife but the stick is super easy yes some real science says blender blades can create bitter flavors and extra virgin olive oil but the effect is pretty subtle and would be easily blown away by the extremely strong flavor of this all right dude all done oh sorry thank you i was just scanning my grocery receipt with the sponsor of this video fetch

chicken is brown it feels soft when i poke it it's done dark meat you can cook pretty much as long as you want to out those pieces come to a plate where they can cool so that i can pull them apart later i find that roasting the bread in big chunks helps keep it from overheating and developing burned flavors however we now have to chop it up into whatever size croutons we like and then return them to the pan to crisp up a little bit more while we finish the salad leave those crumbs behind they'll only burn i'll taste one of those for seasoning needs way more salt if you're feeling naughty you could drop in some butter and back in the oven just remember to reach in and stir those every now and then until they're crisp as you want them okay lettuce caesar salad is traditionally made with romaine lettuce if you had a big fresh one that'd be enough for four dinners this is a small not terribly fresh one so i bought a second when they're not fresh you have to discard the wilted outer leaves hey lettuce is dirty the leaves grow up through the dirt i prefer to tear my leaves into bite-sized pieces and then wash them you can chop salad people say that bruises the leaves more tearing theoretically pulls them apart along their cellular walls as opposed to just cutting through those walls with a knife it certainly doesn't matter if you're doing this shortly before dinner i just tear because it's easier to control little pretty leaves like that i want to leave whole into the sink and the way i like to do this is just submerge everything in a very big bowl swish it around and then lift the lettuce up and out into a strainer all the sand has settled to the bottom of the bowl we are lifting the lettuce up and away from it dry your lettuce on a towel but for what it's worth we started eating a lot more salad a few years ago once we got a salad spinner it's a cheap thing it's just a centrifuge that sends the water flying out to the outer bowl it is so easy and effective and dry lettuce holds dressing so much better into a big mixing bowl and this is my little salad trick mince up a couple of shallots pretty fine it's not like biting into a giant slice of raw onion in a salad you don't even notice it per se it just sends this subtle uniform fresh pungency through the leaves i can handle the chicken now without frying my fingers off so first i'm pulling the skin off this is why i prefer thighs to legs the skin comes off much more easily and you don't have to do this but yeah imma put those skins in with the croutons to get hot and crispy beautiful moist meat underneath you pull it apart with your fingers and you can feel around for chunks of cartilage or any slimy bits anything you don't want to eat and obviously you can take out the bones i recommend big pieces of meat because they'll break apart some more when you toss your salad i like to get the chicken coated in dressing along with the veg salads always need less dressing than you think because most of the volume here is just air so be conservative you can always mix in more i like my salads very lightly dressed which works perfect with the strong flavor of ben's recipe here big handful of that onto a plate one of those pretty little leaves from the heart now are super crunchy chicken fried croutons don't be afraid to pull them out of the oven when they still have some soft juicy spots on them those taste good and they get firmer as they cool some people put parmesan into caesar dressing i'm just depositing some fresh shavings on top heterogeneity and what would a salad be without a big crispy shard of chicken skin i mean duh that's just what salad is it's science caesar salad is such a delightfully old-fashioned thing it was invented in the 1920s by an italian chef in tijuana and it has a delightful roaring 20s decadence to it this is surely one of the most decadent versions definitely not diet food that's salad it's just good,3
What is dry aged beef?

Dovetail restaurant in Macon,...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.187352, this video is sponsored by crowd cow it might not look like it but this in my opinion is some of the finest food on earth so what even is dry aged beef well before vacuum packing revolutionized the meat industry in the 1960s dry aged beef was previously known as beef just normal beef or maybe well hung beef yes that compound adjective has a few very old meanings in english but one of them describes old meat desirably old meat that's what they call me see when you slaughter an animal in a pre-industrial context you either have to cut it up and eat it right away or you're gonna have to let it sit around for a while before you eat it for a couple of reasons first there's rigor mortis when any animal dies when you die your muscles go limp at first but then a couple hours later your muscles go hard and your body locks up stiff it's one of these very creepy things about death that they very rarely get right in the movies rigor has to do with the release of calcium into the intracellular fluid and once it sets in it takes about three days to go away during which time the meat will be very hard to cut and it could be hard to eat depending on how you cook it it's maybe not such a big deal with small tender animals like birds or rabbits but with sheep or goats or cattle it's a really big deal so that's one reason to let an animal sit around for a while after slaughter before you eat it another reason is maybe you and your family are not physically able to eat it all at first i mean a cow is a big thing and if you can't eat it all at once you're gonna have to preserve it in some way to keep it from rotting preserving meat takes time in some climates your only option might be cutting the meat up into little bits and packing it in salt but if you live in a place where you can put the meat somewhere cool and dark and breezy and humid but not too humid well meat can last a very long time if you just kind of hang it up in the air and leave it for weeks for months even i would bet you money that the way that human beings first figured this out is that they hung up the carcass after slaughter to let the blood drain out and then something happened they had to go to war against the neighboring tribe of hunter-gatherers and they came back several days later to that tree where they had hung the carcass to let it bleed out and they were expecting it to be rotten and gross and disgusting and it wasn't why wasn't it foul well field trip to dovetail easily the finest upscale restaurant in macon georgia where i live chef brad stevens food here would be just as popular in a much bigger hipper city and cost three times as much cooking under stevens here is my buddy davis wells a fine young chef in his own right and a huge dry aging nerd he ages a lot of meat himself and he's up on all the signs if you desiccate the exterior of a large piece of meat most bacteria need water to survive and so once you pull the water out and get the exterior basically below say 0.7 water activity bacteria most bacteria just can't survive anymore and then some molds take over and because they're penicilliums they're literally antibiotic pretty cool though it is trickier than it sounds for example the combination of windiness and humidity has to be just right if the air is too wet you're going to encourage some pretty awful surface bacterial growth too low and you dry it too fast on the outside and you can get what's called case hardening which is a similar thing that happens in salami where the exterior dries too fast and so the interior moisture can't escape anymore and that's that's bad and can lead to spoilage but you gotta figure that millennia ago people who just happened to have the right atmospheric conditions where they lived simply noticed that they could hang their meat and it wouldn't go bad and what's more they found that if they hung their meat for a really long time not only was it just not bad it was arguably better than fresh meat and let's test that here are two very nice rib eye steaks the thicker one was dry aged 45 days the thinner one was not oil salt and pepper and i'm cooking them in separate pans i'm shooting for medium rare on both take them out rest carve and here are my tasters my lovely wife lauren and handyman dwayne he's helping us out with some stuff around the house right now and he gets steak very good extremely tender it was delicious more like a filet mignon than kind of tender that's the dry age steak they're talking about they instinctively reached for that now here's the normal one i was less tender less tender good but i'm dying better indeed i thought they were both great but the dry age steak was to me far superior much more tender with a strong nutty roasted flavor that i just loved the normal steak had a brighter fresher flavor for sure which was nice but well the proof is in the leftovers dry aged steak is on the right so why the difference well i'll tell you right after i tell you where i got those steaks i got them from the sponsor of this video crowd cow dry aged beef is very hard to find where i live there is no store that regularly sells it crowd cow is an online marketplace for all kinds of high quality meat and seafood it's a way for you to connect with farmers fishers and ranchers who are raising

check out this 45 day dry aged prime strip loin that chef wells is breaking down at dovetail immediately you can kind of smell on your fingers a certain nuttiness almost cheesiness and that comes from uh penicillium molds that are actually very similar to molds in the cheese making process if you're wondering yes people with penicillin allergies can have bad reactions to all kinds of preserved or aged meat but side note to a side note most people who think they have a penicillin allergy actually do not talk to your doctor about it anyway a lot of what makes that meat taste so different is simply water loss with 45 days you'd expect to lose 20 to 25 percent weight and so with that you get concentrated marbling down here and so this looks i mean not quite like wagyu but certainly better than your average prime new york strip that you'll find at costco or sam's club this is one reason why dry aged beef is so rare and expensive these days meat is sold by weight and this weighs less than it used to the processor has evaporated off money and what's more the desiccated exterior the bark that's really tough it has to be trimmed off so that's even more loss though you can use it for some things some people grind it into burgers it adds a lot of dry age pal boom to a ground beef product note to self now why is moisture loss good i mean aren't we always struggling to keep our steaks as juicy as possible well moisture loss is going to concentrate flavor but a dry aged steak will have less moisture loss on a grill because it's already lost that moisture and speaking of cooking check out what happens when davis throws this under their broiler he advocates simple cooking of dry aged beef you've paid a lot for that flavor why would you want to cover it up with smoke or a sauce so one of the benefits of dry aged beef is it will crust faster because there's less moisture to boil off so you'll start to get a nice sear surprisingly quickly another thing is that the residual glycogen left in muscles are broken down by enzymes into glutamate which is one of the fundamental components of monosodium glutamate or msg so you get not only sugars that are more concentrated but you develop literal glutamic acids that will boost flavor more hence that more roasted taste that i noticed in my dry age steak chef wells here is not just spouting chef mythology the basics of dry aging have been investigated by food scientists for years what's more studies have found that aged beef tastes juicier even when it technically contains less juice this may be because the fat to water ratio is greater and rendered fat coats the mouth better than water does it may also be due to reduced water holding capacity aged beef is more tender and therefore it breaks down more readily as you are chewing on it thereby releasing more juice into your mouth all the juice in the world in a fresher steak is not going to help you if it's locked inside tissue that you're swallowing whole and why exactly is aged beef more tender enzymes are breaking down the collagen casings that around each of these muscle fibers here which is really what we think of when we think of it a tough piece of meat and so it's functionally pre-digesting them those enzymes are naturally present in all muscle tissue they're in your muscles right now breaking your muscles down the difference is you're still alive and you're eating protein which is then replenishing your muscles through a process known as protein turnover the animal dies that process naturally stops enzymes keep breaking down the tissue and it is not replenished hence tenderization this happens in the meat over the course of the first couple of weeks whether you are dry aging or wet aging just letting the meat sit in plastic in its own juices this is how most steak cuts in my part of the world at least are aged if they are aged at all it's a whole lot cheaper for the processors they don't need a special room to hang the meat they just package it up and put it in the fridge maybe send it on a refrigerator truck out to the stores and it ages on the truck it's real real easy there's no evaporation all of the water is trapped right in here there is some moisture loss it's what's known as purge that's the juice that just kind of comes spilling out of the package when you open it up but the processors don't care about that moisture loss because they've already sold you that moisture this was sold by weight and the moisture was in there you've already paid for what you are just sending down the sink potentially though i think you should save it for a sauce that's what i usually do davis like a lot of chefs is not a fan of wet aging generally the threshold for wet aging is four weeks up to six weeks after that you get really strong kind of metallic nickel iron and sourness coming in it gets to tasting like blood basically plus you don't get the additional flavor effects of the beneficial molds and yeast and bacteria the whole point of wrapping this up in plastic is to keep that stuff out and also to deprive what microorganisms are already in there of the oxygen that they need to flourish dry aging in the right conditions discourages bad microorganisms and encourages good ones various molds and bacteria so lactobacillus penicillium camemberty penicillium rook40 again those are things you might know from cheese making that are also naturally present in meat that not only add flavor and kind of cheesy and nuttiness to it but they can help with texture too scientists used to think that wet aging and dry aging resulted in the same exact level of enzymatic tenderization but as this very recent paper shows us there's a mold called femnidium on dry aged beef which can actually re-incorporate new enzymes so kind of prolong the enzymatic tenderization aspect of it so if anybody tells you that wet aged beef is just as tender you tell them about feminium anyway let's wrap this up with some common questions can you dry age meat yourself at home well kind of famously alton brown popularized a method on his show good eats where you just leave a steak uncovered in the fridge for a couple of days brown himself has subsequently acknowledged this only achieves moisture loss very little enzymatic tenderization and none of that cheesy microbial flavor development that you get with real dry aging it doesn't do very much i haven't played with it yet but if i was going to dry age beef myself at home i would get one of these fancy new bags they're just permeable enough to let out the right amount of water some independent research has shown this gets you results comparable to traditional dry aging but with much less trimming loss the desiccated bark layer is not as thick and lastly the big question how long should beef be dry aged opinions diverge quite a lot probably in part because the results are going to differ a lot depending on the specific conditions of your drying chamber the same length of time might do different things in different places if it's a strong micro flora climate in the aging chamber 45-50 days is great past 90 days it can get a little texturally dry almost to say like a serrano ham texture not so much flavor but you do get the kind of sourness from lactobacillus coming in and a pretty significant funk at that point but some people like the funk and that funk is generally gonna be most apparent on the outside crust of the meat that bark so another thing that people will do with the trimmings is throw them in a pan with some water and render all the fat out the water just keeps anything from burning and it makes sure that all the fat is getting cooked you then boil the water out and there you have pure rendered trimming fat here's a little steak that i cut from the end piece of that loin dovetail it's the part that was just below the bark so it's functionally more like a 90-day steak than a 45 it's very dry and now i will baste it in my rendered trimming fat the funky cheesy notes are generally most apparent in the fat because fat absorbs aromas created by the molds and because the fats themselves break down into more aromatic fatty acids as they age slice that up and indeed texturally this has become something other than steak it's really charcuterie and the flavor well let's see what handyman duane thinks that's incredible there's a little bit of a flavor in there i don't know what i mean it's not bad it's the age yeah it's kind of like cheese which i'm not used to it's very good definitely not for everyone but it's definitely for me now if dry aging beef is so great why don't people do it to the meat of other animals well they do that's a conversation for another day,3

Free shipping within the U.S....,2022-12-01 14:47:05.187352, jiggly cake or castella cake is the original name you could say it looks a lot more awesome than it tastes it's been a big food fad across east asia for years these bakeries make cakes the size of love seats and then millions of weirdos on the internet like me watch videos where all they do is cut the cake because the cake goes back and forth and it is spellbinding i've made them myself before but with this chocolate recipe i have focused on making it taste as good as it looks the historical mother recipe for castella is i think four parts egg then one part each of fat milk flour and sugar by weight this is the basic ratio that all the recipes i've read seem to orbit around to convert it to a chocolate cake people usually seem to add an additional part of chocolate which itself is about half cocoa powder and half solid chocolate and then they usually up the sugar a little bit i played with these ratios until i got a cake that i think is really tasty and super jiggly rather than bake a giant one i'm doing a normal home kitchen size this is an 8 inch cake pan 20 centimeters and then you need a bigger pan that it will nest into my roasting tray is my biggest pan and in it goes to the middle of the oven where i will fill it part way with water not so much water that the displacement of my cake pan will cause a flood that's an easy thing to test for time to get all that heating up to 350 fahrenheit 180c i'm using my convection fan castella is a sponge cake and with any kind of sponge cake you pretty much have to line the pan with parchment paper i'm just cutting that piece into a square like the pan and then i will snip a little diagonal into each corner each cut is about the same length as the pan is deep now all i have to do is smash that in there and the corners fit pretty well there are more precise ways to line a square pan with parchment but that is good enough for me now batter a microwave safe bowl on the scale this is a rare time that i really think i need the precision of weight measurement 75 grams of any neutral cooking oil then comes about 35 grams of semi-sweet chocolate chips or any solid chocolate you like then about 60 grams of milk i find you got to cut back on the moisture a bit from the mother recipe to account for the moisture of the melted chocolate and melt this i will in the microwave you can do it on the stove just really gently for like 45 seconds in there until it's bubbling i'll take that out and whisk it smooth in goes about 40 grams of dutch cocoa i'm pretty sure they use dutch at original cake bakery in taipei whose recipe i'm basically trying to reverse engineer here their batter looks very dark at this stage it would be lighter if we use natural cocoa than cake flour and i really find bleached cake flour does better for jiggly cake it holds more moisture and gives you that pudding like texture 75 grams of that i don't think original cake does this but i really found a big splash of vanilla in there improves the flavor a lot and it's okay if this is kind of unmixable at this stage the egg yolks are coming six large eggs that i'm cracking into a bowl that should seem too big for the job we're gonna whip the whites in here the yolks all go into the chocolate mixture i've found that really fresh eggs help you avoid the kind of farty sulfurous egg aroma that a cake this eggy can have problem is fresh eggs are harder to separate the white really wants to stick to the yolk which is why i'm separating them in my fingers you can literally pinch off stubborn bits of white between your fingers i'll mix the yolks into all of this while it's still warm if the temperature drops too much the chocolate might solidify into hard little grains no worries if you can't get this totally smooth there's still more moisture coming over here the whites along with a tiny pinch of salt and a little bit of cream of tartar or really any food acid both chemicals help us to whip these proteins into a foam so pillowy that you would want to dive face first into it like my new mattress from the sponsor of this video helix let's thank them helix is a

around you but it is firm and supportive under there too do your back and this channel a favor and go to helixsleep.com you'll get up to 200 off your helix sleep mattress plus two free pillows that link is in the description thank you helix and did i mention that i weighed out like 130 grams of sugar in a little bowl might seem like a lot of sugar but i really think you need it to balance the chocolate and to give the cake a cotton candy like texture once the egg whites are very foamy and leaving trails like that behind the beaters you can gradually stir in the sugar a little bit of sugar you can dump in all at once but with this much you kind of gotta dose it or it might collapse the foam i've really found this is key to jiggly cake beating the sugar into the egg whites until you get a very fluffy stiff meringue the sugar reinforces the foam i'm looking for pretty stiff peaks like that snowy spire right there awesome we're done with the beaters now i'm gonna do that classical thing they do with souffles and such where you take a little bit of your foam and beat it mercilessly into your sticky ingredients you don't worry about preserving the bubbles you just use this to lighten up the mixture to get it smooth and ready to integrate more gently into the rest of the foam i'm doing that cut and fold over move with the spatula trying to integrate this in as few strokes as possible to preserve bubbles if you work it too much you'll feel it get less stiff it'll go all runny and liquid and then it won't bake as fluffy you could actually bake it streaky like that it comes out looking pretty cool but i'm gonna get it totally smooth and it is ready to pour in the pan the taller the cake is the more jiggly it'll be so i formulated this to fill my eight inch pan all the way to the brim if you're using a wider pan i think you'd want to up your batter quantities accordingly nice and smooth and i'm topping with a few chocolate chips sometimes they sink into the batter a little bit sometimes they don't either way they stay near the top where they provide some much needed heterogeneity you could mix them all the way through if you wanted all done just got to drop this gently into the water bath which will keep the sides of the cake from overheating and the steam will keep the dome of the cake pliable allowing everything to expand and balloon with steam 40 minutes in and you can see it's still raw in the center from how it sloshes 10 minutes later i'll poke it with a skewer still very muddy not done yet after about an hour total poke again and i find that you don't want it to be totally clean if it is the cake will be dry and not very jiggly that's perfect right there now i could try to lift out this pan but i'd probably get my oven mitts wet and maybe scald myself instead i'll just use the parchment sling and simply lift the cake right out of there i'll come back for both pans when they've cooled and there you go we can peel the paper off these eggy batters are super sticky imagine if it was stuck like this to the pan and you can't lube the pan the batter needs to stick to the walls so that it can climb and get super fluffy and jiggly cut that up in the videos from the bakeries in taiwan and such i always see them cutting it into big rectangles while it's still steaming hot i think it's good to eat this warm because it isn't so gelatinous after it cools that is really tasty and it's crazy to think that it doesn't have any gelatin or modified corn starch or anything it's just the magic of eggs making it so wobbly and with the chocolate the flavor is almost as good as the texture the chocolate easily overwhelms any unpleasant aroma you might get from the eggs you get the hang of this cake and you've got a pretty easy and simple recipe that'll make people very happy wubba wubba,3

""The Kelloggs: the Battling Brothers of Battle Creek,""...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.187352, behold the birth of the modern breakfast cereal industry or at least this is my very rough historical reconstruction of the event it's hard to know exactly what happened because the people involved grew to absolutely hate each other and they naturally left conflicting accounts to posterity regardless this moment in 1894 was momentous prior to the invention of pre-cooked ready-to-eat cereals breakfast was a huge pain to make picture it say you're a typical mom on a family farm in pre-industrial agrarian times you need to feed your family something when they wake up so they can go out and toil in the fields they need body fuel so in order to cook for them you're gonna have to wake up at least an hour before they do it's gonna be pitch black and it's gonna be cold by candlelight you get a little coal or wood fire going in your stove because of course you don't have electricity yet then you put some whole or roughly milled grains on the boil and it takes at least 45 minutes for them to soften into a porridge that is remotely digestible why not just bake bread well remember traditional yeast breads take hours to rise you would work through the night to bake for the morning there's a reason bakers go to work at two in the morning chemical leavening agents for quick breads only hit the market in the mid-19th century and even then biscuits or pancakes are still no small deal to make in the morning you could bake bread the previous day for the morning but in the days before chemical dough conditioners or airtight storage methods bread went stale really fast it would be hard by the morning of course when you live on a farm the first thing you do when the rooster crows is milk the cows and collect the chicken eggs that has to be done first thing so in the morning you've got milk and eggs and if you soak your stale bread in milk and eggs and then cook it you've got french toast people all over the world have had brilliant breakfast tricks like that for generations right but say you didn't have ample access to ham or salted fish or dairy or eggs well in that situation a gummy slow cooked porridge was still often going to be your best option generally no staple food was or is cheaper than grain porridge was also going to be your best option if you believed what dr john harvey kellogg believed he believed that modern flower milling practices popularized in the 19th century were removing much of the nutrition from whole grains and he was absolutely right about that kellogg also believed that meat and dairy were causing all manner of digestive and other ailments in people he was probably right about that too and kellogg believed that meat and really any food that you enjoyed a whole lot was over stimulating that all manner of bodily pleasures would drain your body of a finite supply of vital energy that you are born with and once you are all out of it you simply die he thought the key to longevity was to not enjoy anything i'm not sure if he was right about that but this was the belief system on which he built his massively popular battle creek sanitarium in michigan and he constantly tinkered with bland whole grain foods that his patients would be willing and able to choke down i'll be referring here primarily to the battling brothers of battle creek this excellent book by physician and historian howard markle at the university of michigan in the late 1870s kellogg was serving his patients a kind of zevi back in the morning zveyback is german for twice baked you bake a loaf you slice it up and then you bake it again a lot the english word for this is rusk virtually every people on earth developed some traditional form of this mostly for the purpose of extending shelf life dehydrated bread won't go moldy as fast dr kellogg liked vybeck for a couple of reasons one his patients hated eating it absolutely hated it and kellogg is a guy whose scientific medical and religious philosophy of pleasure denial really quite often crossed the line into sadism for a whole video that i made about the philosophical underpinnings of breakfast cereal there's a link in the description another reason kellogg liked vyback is that he believed long high temperature cooking made the carbohydrates in grains more digestible and he wasn't totally wrong about that grains are primarily starch that's what the white fluffy stuff in there is starch molecules are huge glucose polymers giant chains of glucose all linked together glucose is the sweet sugar on which your body runs and when you take in starch your body has to break it down into individual little glucose molecules before it can burn them as fuel now a lot of dr kellogg's patients at the sanitarium in michigan had terrible digestive problems that's why they came to him they had heartburn they had constipation all kinds of bad things and kellogg believed that part of what was going on with them was that their bodies were not able to break more complex carbohydrates down into simpler sugars that their body could more easily digest kellogg was probably not entirely right about that but he was definitely right that intense dry heat can break starches down into simpler sugars like dextrose which is a kind of glucose and he therefore called this process dextrinization and it is why a nice brown roast potato tastes a little sweet even though the starches in there are too big to link up with the sweetness receptors on your tongue some of those starches on the surface there have been broken down effectively pre-digested which you could argue is what cooking is all about anyway kellogg's patients hated this vibe one of them broke her dentures on it so in 1877 kellogg baked a multi-grain dough very hard and brown to dextrinize it then he ground it up into breadcrumbs so that it would be easier to chew and he called these little grains of grain granula unfortunately it turned out that a guy in new york state named james calib jackson had invented a very similar product some years earlier and he also called it granula so kellogg tweaked his name to granola this is what that evolved into though it was originally a lot closer to something like grape nuts that we have today grape in the name refers to grape sugar which is an old-fashioned name for glucose which you get by dextrinizing the grains with very intense cooking a kellogg did this for digestibility but a side effect of baking the crap out of your grains is you dehydrate them and you deactivate enzymes and you certainly destroy any microorganisms all of this extends shelf life you get a pre-cooked shelf stable breakfast john kellogg's little brother will kellogg was the far more sensible and enterprising of the two he saw the commercial potential here and he started mass producing sanitarium foods granola but it was still like chewing on a mouthful of pebbles modern light and crispy breakfast cereals had yet to be born that would take the kind of industrial ingenuity that also has given us harry's the sponsor of today's

harrys.com adamar thank you harry's so while the kellogg brothers were working on granola the wheat-based health food fad reached a lawyer in denver colorado named henry perky inspired by his own chronic indigestion perky was doing his own wheat experiments he boiled some grains and then squeezed them through a pair of metal rollers with little grooves in them little threads came out the other end which perky heaped into pillows and then baked shredded wheat the sugar frosting would come much later problem was perky did not originally bake them as hard as they are today they were still a little soft and wet when he baked them and as a result they were not as crunchy and they got moldy really fast perky's original idea therefore was not to mass produce the cereal but to mass produce the rolling machine so that people can make their own shredded wheat at home fresh every day how fun so kellogg eventually caught wind of what perky was doing and the two met up and kellogg said to perky hey man what you gotta do is you gotta dextrinize this you gotta bake the crap out of it so that it's more digestible perky did this which of course also rendered his little biscuits shelf stable and yeah shredded wheat became a big business which the kellogg brothers tried to buy from perky in 1894. the historian howard markle here is not sure why that deal fell through but it did so john and will kellogg set about trying to develop a better version of their own i mean i love shredded wheat but also my stress goes right to my jaw therefore i love chewing on really hard dense things not everybody else does john kellogg will and john's wife ella here all participated in the invention that came next as did several of their employees ella hated will and john and will came to hate each other so in their respective versions of this history they all minimized each other's contributions and inflated their own i'm gonna circumvent this whole sticky wicket by simply referring to everyone involved as they they first tried boiling grains like henry perky did to soften them up and then they tried pressing them through a strainer to break them apart into little pieces to later be baked hard this did not work way too sticky then they tried rolling the boiled grain out with a rolling pin still pretty sticky but they scraped up these pieces baked them hard and then they had a proto-flaked cereal you know that's not as bad as it looks to make production go a little faster they then tried passing that boiled grain through a pair of metal rollers not terribly unlike this pasta machine that i have here that too proved to be really tricky it was just way too sticky it was hard to scrape them out from the bottom of the rollers then for some reason they tried boiling the grain and then letting it sit for like a day according to one version of the story it was because john got called into surgery so they just had to stop and let the pot sit for a day let's try that you let that sit overnight and then the next day you have the most disappointing tray of rice krispies treats ever i should say i am not totally sure that this is the substance that the kellogg's were working with they described it as a dough and in modern english a dough is a thick wet mass made with powdered grains flour not whole grains but as we see here in the oed dough used to have some broader meanings and will kellogg's account of what happened next sure suggests to me that they were working with whole boiled grains he says they pushed the day-old boiled grain through the rollers and each wheat berry came out as a perfect individual flake that sure sounds like whole boiled grains to me and as they sat for a day after they cooked their moisture content equalized through the whole grain they tempered also they got to room temperatures they cooled down a little bit and the outside probably dried out a bit as a result everything passed through the rollers much more cleanly i think my wheat here is still a little too wet does that look like a corn flake to you well you still gotta bake it up hard next and then you get what a lot of people consider the first true modern breakfast cereal shelf stable and light not dense crispy rather than crunchy today's manufacturing process for flaked cereal is pretty similar there's a great old episode of the tv show how it's made all about this it's linked in the description basically they take the grains they boil or steam them they mash them up a little bit and then they blow dry them rapidly dry them before dropping them through the rollers and then baking them up crisp and there you go john kellogg believed they'd made a great contribution to humanity will believed that they had struck gold it was will who proceeded to mass market cornflakes over his older brother's objections it was will who figured out that replacing wheat with corn was both cheaper and tastier and it was will who started mixing in added sugar and salt john was horrified by this remember his whole goal was to make the least enjoyable food possible if you want to know more about the decades-long legal and personal fight that ensued i highly recommend howard markle's book here there's a link in the description remember that markle is also a physician and let's end with his assessment of the modern breakfast cereals as a health food john kellogg for medical reasons was trying to convert grains into more easily digestible carbs but that has turned out to be the least healthy thing about cereal this stuff is very high on the glycemic index meaning that you eat it your body rapidly converts it into a sudden rush of blood sugar this prompts your pancreas to release a ton of this hormone insulin into your bloodstream and that facilitates the rapid absorption of that sugar into your cells this then results in a blood sugar crash you go hypoglycemic you get really cranky you might even get a little bit lightheaded and you're super hungry even though you just ate like an hour ago and so you eat some more and then this whole cycle just repeats this was a good thing in the natural context for which the human body evolved imagine that you and your ancient hunter-gatherer buddies wander into a wild fruit grove you shove as much sugary fruit down your gullet as you can your body recognizes this as a rare opportunity to store a bunch of energy so it converts a lot of that sugar into body fat and then it makes you hungry again like an hour later so that you will stay in that grove and keep eating the fruit for as long as it lasts you gotta store up fat now for the lean times ahead when there will be no fruit to gorge it's a totally genius system trouble is thanks to the innovations of agri-industrialists like will kellogg there are no lean times anymore at least not for a lot of us in the developed world there is always fruit on the branch and as a result the quick carb cycle never stops it becomes a vicious circle that so many of us struggle every day to escape and that may prove to be the kellogg brothers most enduring legacy,3

***RECIPE, SERVES FOUR***

4 large Italian sausages, about 6...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.187352, sausage and peppers is an italian-american classic that is massively improved in my opinion via a two-stage cooking of the sausages and a heavy hand with the vinegar helps too i need my biggest pan to make four generous portions a little oil in there turn the heat on medium and in goes four big italian sausages i'm doing too hot and too sweet that's a pound and a half of meat 700 grams or thereabouts it's easily enough for four people with all the vegetables and i'm gonna need to assess the rigidity of my sausage see i want to brown these until they're most of the way cooked inside and by poking them while they're raw i get a baseline reading of what totally raw feels like i need to keep rolling these around and browning them until the inside doesn't feel completely squishy anymore i'm exchanging their places because contrary to popular belief cast iron does not actually heat that evenly the middle of the pan is way hotter while these are going i can prep all my vegetables this is a great thing to do in the summer when they have a bunch of weird sweet peppers at the farmer's market get anything that looks cool there's two ways to handle a bell pepper the first is cut it in half and then just reach in and tear out the stem ribs and seeds not because they're spicy they're not they're just fibrous not very tasty nice big slices there remember they're going to shrink a lot when they cook second way is to hold it upright by the stem and then fillet off the sides cut away the flesh that you do want the part that you don't want will be the only thing left standing i have no idea which method i prefer what i do know for sure is that when you slice them it's better to slice into the flesh side the skin side is tough and slippery the knife could easily slide off in contrast the blade bites much more readily into the flesh side plus it lays flatter this is a time when i want a real onion not a shallot i want those thicker layers these will cook in the same time as the peppers and i want a lot of onions again nice big wedges so we've got three large bell peppers and one big onion that'll give us roughly equal volume vegetables and meat once cooked speaking of which my hot sausage has exploded it happens keep rolling these around get really nice brown color on all sides gentle heat a little below medium now i don't want stuff on the bottom of the pan to burn before these are almost cooked through i can feel they're about there when i poke them they're bouncy but still a hair squishy in the center which is perfect slide the pan off the heat for a minute so nothing burns in there and out the sausages come to my board at this stage you could just cut these into little rounds maybe at an angle to make them look a little prettier but i'm going to unseam them from knave to the chaps this is a lot easier if you have an extra long carving knife right down the middle and there you can see there's still a little pink which is perfect this way they won't be overcooked by the time we're done with them pan back on the heat now and i'm going to lay these in cut side down this is one of those situations where if they don't quite fit now they will in a minute after everything cooks and shrinks some more we're going to get some beautiful brown color on the cut sides of the sausage if we had not pre-cooked them before we cut them well then the soft raw sausage would have just spilled out of its sheath but my hot italian sausage is well contained today thanks to the sponsor of this

description sheath underwear dot com slash ragucia use my code ragusia and get 20 off save 20 on your sheath with my link and code in the description thank you sheath now these i'm definitely going to have to juggle around the pan the ones around the edge are not nearly brown enough yet i want delicious sizzling crust on every square millimeter the thinner pieces can come out first those are done look at that am i right no real rush here we're going to reheat the sausages before we eat them so they can have all the time they require and then into all that hot fat and fond goes our vegetables at this point i'd turn the heat up a bit there's so much mass in there so much water to deglaze the bottom of the pan nothing is going to burn anytime soon you just have to keep it all moving and rotating bring stuff up from the bottom onto the top and vice versa like all vegetables these will continue to cook and noticeably soften as we're doing our final touches and scooping stuff onto plates so you want to start wrapping things up well before they are as tender as you want them in the end i'm going to deglaze with at least a quarter cup of red wine vinegar like 60 mls or any vinegar really a lot of people just use wine i think this does well with much more acidity especially if you balance it with a spoonful of sugar mix everything together and scrape off the pan you get this dark brown sweet and sour syrup coating everything it's the best grab a pepper and taste it we need a lot more salt in there and some pepper i'm tempted to add some hot sauce or chili flakes but i gotta remember i'm eating this with spicy sausages so it'll all balance out in the mouth speaking of which sausages back in it's a slightly awkward maneuver but you can get everything tossed around in that pan sauce and reheated in fact i'm going to turn the heat off there's plenty enough in the pan last thing is some fresh herb this is one of the few contexts in which i like fresh oregano the floral notes of it just work well with the peppers but thyme or basil would be great now what do you do with this i say just eat it put the pan in the middle of the table to keep everything hot give people a pair of tongs and some plates and you got a super satisfying low-carb meal if you used plant-based sausages it'd be vegan but if you must have a starch consider polenta there's like three cups of water up to a boil in there a pinch of salt to get it started and just half a cup of finely ground cornmeal you only need a little for soft polenta you gotta whisk continuously as it gelatinizes just to keep any lumps from forming and then you can just take the heat all the way down to low and let it sit for a while it's edible now but it'll get softer and creamier as it cooks for at least a half an hour i'd say you can add more water if you think it needs it when you're close to eating you can melt in as much butter as you can justify great in a little parmesan or pecorino a little goes a long way in polenta taste for seasoning and here's an easy trick to make this look sexy plop it on the plate and then tilt the plate around let the polenta run into a beautiful even layer all across the plate you don't need much it almost serves as a sauce or a gravy for everything as much as it serves as a starch that is the white tablecloth version of this dinner for the white tank top version get yourself a hoagie roll and toast it under the top element for a minute no more than that or it'll be brittle and tear another advantage of cleaving your sausages is they are now drier pleasantly drier this sandwich doesn't spurt all over your open-chested tracksuit when you bite into it doesn't even need mustard because it's got that sweet vinegar tastes like a fair to me gotta find a poorly inspected ferris wheel to climb on now,3

exactly what it sounds like you just tuck a ring of cheese into the dough around the edge but there's a lot that can go wrong leaks of various kinds i think i've worked out a pretty reliable method here dough is my normal recipe in the description i am making it via the well method today for no particular reason and for stuffed crust i think it helps to knead in a little extra flour it should be sticky but just a little sticky like that a drier dough like that will be stronger less likely to tear and leak and where i would normally divide this much dough into four pizzas i'm doing three you need a little extra dough per pizza to wrap that ring and i'm not putting any olive oil in the bowl where i will rise this i find oil on the dough ball surface can make it harder to get a good seal around the cheese let those rise to make stuffed crust we need string cheese my brand is back i love this kind string cheese has been worked so that its proteins line up in these long parallel threads and it comes out of the machines in these big long coils certainly a lot of the pros use the whole unbroken coil for stuffed crusts but we can just line these pieces up end to end these are too thick for me for a home oven sized pizza so i'm cutting them in half you can leave them whole maybe you can handle that much dairy i'll chill these and i'm thrilled to use string cheese for the top of my pizza too the whole milk low moisture version of this brand is my favorite pizza cheese galbani sells a block version but is not the same as the string version i think this is better it's dryer it's sharper yes i cut it into weird pellets chill those my sauce is just this brand of crushed tomatoes with some olive oil dried herbs pinch of sugar now check this a pizza screen it only costs a few bucks 14 inch diameter like this is a good maximum size for a home oven i would either plan to bake on one of these or on parchment paper you will see why here's my dough after two days of cold rise in the fridge you could do two hours on the counter instead but i think this tastes better and it'll be easier to work with cold right on the counter i am rolling this out no flour dusting i want it to stick to the counter the sticking will keep it from snapping back like a rubber band i'm trying to get it pretty evenly round and a little wider than my screen is not quite there yet push down hard from the middle then push out hand stretching would not get the outer ring thin enough for stuffed crust there we go i'm gonna peel that off the counter if the dough wasn't cold it'll be more likely to tear right here now on top of the screen this goes and i'll try to position it as evenly over the screen as possible we need a lot of very thin excess dough around the edge to fold over and seal the cheese so i'm just rolling out the skirts that's hanging over the edge there again i want it to stick the counter is keeping it stretched out for me it's important you have a lot of excess all the way around i've got a short bit there so i'm tearing excess from elsewhere and grafting it on there you go looks like we flayed somebody alive time for our cheese ring around and around and around we go three four and wet with water and wet with water now fold and crimp and fold and crimp if you don't have a ton of excess folded back onto the interior of the pizza like this the cheese ring is very likely to leak into the center having a lot of excess also means that you don't have to stretch the dough so tight over the cheese that it might tear and then leak through the outer side or the bottom over here i've got some butter in a pan and i'm gonna put in some herbs and spices and enough salt to make it sandy in there since this pizza will have a lot of untopped crust we might as well make that surface taste better top and sides all over and now that everything is greasy and your fingertips won't stick to the dough you can go back and press hard to seal the cheese ring in there it's taken us a long time to prepare this pizza and if it was just sitting on a wooden or metal peel right now it would be hopelessly stuck by the time we tried to shimmy it into the oven this is why for stuffed crust i think it makes a lot of sense to bake on a screen or directly on parchment paper sauce is on parmesan from the can sorry that's just the taste of pizza to me use what you want now here's my weird mozzarella pellets you don't have to do this the reason i'm doing it is my new oven has proved to be kind of disappointing for pizza making it just doesn't get hot enough by the time my crust is brown my cheese has overheated and squeezed out buckets of orange grease by putting chilled cheese on in huge chunks i am significantly slowing the melting process my oven's on full blast and i preheated my baking steel for an hour without a steel or a stone the bottom would not brown i also find i need to switch to the broiler halfway through with this oven that's the top element but you know every oven is different this oven also just doesn't seem to get much heat onto the sides of things on any setting but that still looks pretty darn good oh hey it's my lovely wife lauren what's she got there now when a certain well-known restaurant chain does stuffed crust pizza they are using a special blend design to hold its shape when heated this cheese is going to flatten and give off steam that makes a hollow dome above it but i don't think that's a bad thing that cavity makes for kind of a croissant-like texture as you bite down through it the pizza screen has given the bottom a golden finish that reminds me of airport pizza screens are popular in food service but i kind of dig that for stuffed crust feels appropriate somehow cheers and hey if you like pizza consider buying lauren's latest why a novel it's kind of a cheesy love story in bookstores everywhere as of today should i do an adam ragia i suppose this is not officially a sponsorship that i need to disclose but you know we're married so we share the money well here i'll go like this the idea came from a viral story about a woman who gave birth in a chick-fil-a um the book is about a girl who was born on the bathroom floor of a locally owned pizza parlor called hot and crusty pizza um she is gifted free pizza for life and a guaranteed job when she turned 16 and we open on her 16th birthday when she's about to start the job and she really does not want to well it was a long gestation because i started writing this in fall of 2018. noon just before adam went viral for pizza yes you will think that she is exploiting all of this here okay but he exploited me indeed yes although actually the fact that i was making pizza obsessively before the youtube thing happened is that why you were thinking of pizza when you wrote a book probably i mean i'm sure it's it's all connected so the reason we're making stuffed crust pizza is because it is sort of a long-running joke in the book that at this pizza place at the end of every shift they keep finding stuffed crust pizza in the restaurant but they don't make stuffed crust pizza at hot and crusty so they're trying always trying to figure out who is bringing in pizza from another pizza place so the book is out today you can buy it wherever books are sold if you look in the link in the bottom situation you can get a signed copy if you order from little shop of stories in decatur georgia i will be signing books there on saturday march 13th so if you order by then your copy will arrive signed and there's a link down below for that

squarespace sous-vide i think i'm gonna say overrated which is not to say that sous-vide isn't good like soviet is really good it has lots of advantages but i also think that a lot of the things that are good about sous-vide are good about stewing and poaching generally right like it doesn't have to be in a bag i agree welcome everybody to ask adam a very special episode normally my lovely wife is the person who reads your questions to me to answer um this time it's uh it's somebody else um also named lauren though everyone who does this job has to be named lauren it's the law so you might recall that some episodes back i encouraged everybody to fill out a survey for a video that i did about meat washing practices and i said that of those people who filled out that survey um i would choose one to do an ask adam with me as a little bit of an incentive well um here's the winner congratulations hello hi nice to meet you lauren wilson tell the people about yourself alrighty well okay yes i am lauren um i'm a college student i go to brown in rhode island but currently you know because of the pandemic i'm actually at home in michigan and it's so funny i just saw your um serial episode that you just uploaded to your channel about battle creek and i thought that only people from michigan were proud that kellogg was headquartered there so definitely felt like a shout out it was great timing well thank you for watching my programs and thank you for doing this with me today um do we have a question the first thing i got was from your instagram i got do you ever regret leaving academia to pursue youtube uh or do you think that leaving mercer and pursuing youtube as a cook was the best idea in terms of your passion huh okay so in terms of my passions as opposed to in terms of like you know job security providing for my family all that kind of stuff okay yes no i don't think i regret it i you know i think that um this is like a good job for me it it it allows me to combine several of the distinct things that i like to do and have some competency with i i miss i miss the university environment in some ways i don't miss it in others i do not miss the uh you know the bureaucracy and the administration and and all that kind of stuff and when i say that i don't mean like the the people who constitute the administration like i know lovely administrators at many universities i just mean just the you know the committee meetings basically like the things i do miss about like the college environment is honestly like being around people like you lauren like um i think i imagine you may find as you get older that like um you know it it it can feel good to hang around with to be around younger people who are more energetic and less jaded you know i can see that it's energizing uh to be around people who have not been beaten down by the world yet um who have not totally sacrificed all their principles yet i mean they'll get there it's on their schedule but you know it feels good to be around that kind of like energy and youthful optimism and and but on the other hand like i don't this you know like there's a reason that you're here right now which is that it's like i think probably the plurality of my audience is like college-age people or thereabouts so i still am around you know y'all a lot um and that's nice but i miss you know you know being around y'all more because y'all are you know there's a reason the broader kind of culture is obsessed with youth in particular college in particular like it's a good it's a good scene it's a good place it's a good time of life for a lot of people if it's not a good time of life for you right now please don't not you lauren but whoever's watching um if you're not having a good time in college right now please don't think that that means that you're broken that something is wrong with you um that you'll never be happy later on in your life because that's like that's the dangerous thing about telling young people like oh you're going to go to college to be the best time of your life and you get there it's not the best time of your life and you think or rather you get there and it's bad you don't have a good time you think oh my god this is as good as it gets it's only downhill from here like that is soul crushing and that simply is not the case for a lot of people i did not have a very good time in college lots of people don't have a very good time in college like people you'll find your time and when you find your place in the world tell the world about it with a website

squarespace.com ragusia thank you squarespace and speaking of major changes um this is like more on a personal note but my dad actually recently moved to macon which is really crazy yes and what was made what made me originally interested in your video i think it must have come up you know on my recommended and then i saw macon and i was like what that's crazy so i think that is um something that definitely made me interested in you i guess what i'm wondering because i haven't gotten the chance to visit him yet because he moved during the pandemic was um what's like the food scene like out there and also are there any like ethnic cuisines that are kind of like prominent i know like in metro detroit where i'm from we have lots of lebanese food and things like that in terms of like the food scene i think that you know the things that i have responded to the most have been the things that you would expect the soul food scene uh the barbecue scene um and then there's like things within that category that are surprising like we have so many vegan soul food restaurants at this point it's a really and it's a really interesting scene that i would love to kind of feature once i can be around people safely again um you know just like all of the ways that you can make barbecue with jackfruit instead of pig is really interesting right um and and so that's cool but there's also it's like it's like the broader the broader phenomenon the kind of incredible flowering of of food that is happening everywhere is happening here too right like it you know it used to be that like the only you know good upscale restaurants were in like a handful of cities and now like any city in the highly developed world with a population over 50 000 or something has got at least one really good you know upper market restaurant and uh and that's awesome and that's you know the reasons for that proliferation are i think really complex and it's not entirely a good story but there's there's just you know there's there's some really really great like you know restaurants here as there are almost everywhere now and i think that's mostly a thing to be celebrated i would say so too i also i think on that note one of my follow-up questions for that is i think for the future of your channel do you ever see yourself wanting to potentially travel to any of these cities i think large or small kind of hole in the wall or not yeah absolutely i my my business plan that i had made when i quit my my teaching job to do this full-time was all about me like traveling at least once a month to go do a field shoot and then like a month later kovit happened and so here we are of course so i'm i'm so i'm so jazzed for everybody to get the damn vaccine and i can start you know getting on a plane and going places and putting my camera on things because i'm really sick of putting my camera on things within these four walls and people within these four walls i'm sick of myself is basically what it boils down to really tired of editing this face i look forward to editing your face lauren i think that i definitely think about that because i've just been i've been watching youtube since i was six years old i'm truly like one of the people that grew up on youtube and so i'm like i can't imagine editing myself like for probably what dozens of hours like you know every month anyway it's super weird and it's one of the worst parts of the job like it's it's like because especially like i mean i think if if you're a person who's really really into your appearance maybe that's not so torturous but like i'm someone who has tried to ignore my my physical appearance most of my life right um on the other hand i think in some ways it's actually helped me like bust through some barriers there i can see that what do they call that like immersion therapy for phobias you know like if you're scared of spiders drop them in a pit of spiders right like i have been dropped into a pit of spiders having to edit my own damn face on the other hand it has also made me more self-conscious about certain other things because it's like when you when you look at footage of yourself taken at least once a week every week you see how much your appearance actually like vacillates and changes on a moment-to-moment basis like in particular in response to like i've learned how much your appearance or at least my i shouldn't universalize my experience but i mean how much my appearance changes in response to what i've eaten in the last 24 hours or so right like if i've had a lot of pizza i you know between the water retention from the sodium and the glycogen from the um you know the excessive carb intake like my cheeks just swell up like balloons you know and i look and people will people will comment on my on my videos and be like oh hey you know oh adam boy he's been eating too many brownies or the inverse boy adam's looking shredded and it's like dude my body composition is like identical it's just the only difference is how much junk i ate in the last 24 hours if i ate a lot of junk in the last 24 hours i'm puffy if i didn't i'm not and i think that's probably true for everyone but we're just not aware of it because we don't normally have to contemplate our own faces as much as i have to contemplate mine no that's really interesting and i think speaking of i guess then like kind of like food trends because i know healthy food and like things like that like appearance perceiving ourselves i feel like that's definitely big right now especially on tick tock so i guess in one or at least like in a couple words what do you think about these few food trends i have uh i have three of them do you think they're overrated or underrated so first i have sous-vide and then also air fryers and just the general concept of superfoods sous-vide i think i'm going to say overrated um i think a lot of the which is not to say that sous-vide isn't good like sous-vide is really good it has lots of advantages but i also think that a lot of the things that are good about sous-vide are good about stewing and poaching generally right like it doesn't have to be in a bag i agree unfortunately i think this is chiefly about meat i mean sous-vide's primary utility is meat so i'm going to talk about meat um you know like one of the great things about meat about sous-vide for cooking meat is that it's like you can you know you wrap up a piece of meat you can stick it into a water bath with an immersion circulator maintaining a constant temperature and then it's it's physically impossible to overcook it you set the temperature of the water to like 140 fahrenheit or whatever like target internal temperature you have for your for your meat and it'll it and it because of the laws of thermodynamics like the the temperature inside the meat cannot exceed the temperature outside the meat and once it comes to thermal equilibrium right so and that's awesome that's great but that has been true of poaching forever forever right poaching is a great and easy way to cook now if you have a gas stove it's pretty easy to maintain at constant temperature with with a resistance coil you've got the the cycling on and off thing to kind of uh contend with so you could have spikes in temperature but generally especially if you're using a heavy bottomed pot like that sort of heavy the mass of the pot serves as a kind of regulator valve on those fluctuations of heat from the cycling resistance coil and as a result like you can maintain a pretty damn steady temperature of 140 in your poaching liquid in the pot like it doesn't have to be in a bag just put the meat in a pot with some liquid it's great it's been great for thousands of years like do you want to weigh in lauren go ahead no i just i've seen it blow up and like just even like sous vides that were like the immersion um cookers that were on online have like they've really gone down in price i feel like people like everywhere like i gotta get my hands on one so i was just wondering because i know it's great for people that are maybe afraid of meat but i'm not afraid of handling meat so well i hadn't thought of it that dimension of it lauren until you said it just now is that like it it's sanitizing right it's like for people for people who are increasingly divorced from the messy realities of our life as corporeal beings right like the yeah it's like we people want shrink-wrapped everything nowadays and and and sous-vide is part of that broader phenomenon i had not considered that until you said it and then i guess the next one is just the air fryer um i refuse to say the name because i think the name is dumb it is a tabletop convection oven is what it is but strip that away and i think they're awesome and if i was if i were you lauren like if i was a college student i think i would be that would be my chief axe right like i i would cook primarily with my air fryer if i was only feeding myself or and maybe one other person most of the time in a small space without much money a hundred percent i would be using my tabletop convection oven okay nice yeah i haven't gotten one just because my apartment is literally so small and i have no more um counter space to put another appliance the coffee machine is uh my main concern a person has to have priorities i mean really yeah i definitely want to get one probably post grad we'll see we'll see um and then the next one i think is just super foods because i definitely got into them at one point i feel like again youtube food media and then now i'm thinking to myself okay maybe i should just you know eat what i want what are you thinking um what what kinds of things were you seeking out and eating on the basis of their superness well i'm thinking about things like goji berries maca powder the hemp seeds of the world all of those sorts of things that cost like 15 dollars that you have to order online um it's such a complicated topic because like each one of these things is its own thing and some of their their sort of super reputations are more substantiated by available research than others right um you know but i also i think it's the in general i mean i think there's some good things about the trends in the sense that it's good to sort of have some kind of impetus to expose yourself to something new to go outside your comfort zone and try something that you wouldn't have normally right that's always good um um but like it's from from the millions of conversations i have all the time with all kinds of food and nutrition professionals scientists physicians etc etc it's like you know they all will most of them will say the same thing which is that it's just people that it all causes people to lose the forest for the trees right people will think like oh i'm gonna have like this purple food that has antioxidants in it and i'm gonna really seek it out right while i continue to like shove other carcinogens down my throat you know like well like like it's it's the the benefits that you're gonna get from the acai berry or whatever is really really tiny compared to the detriment you're doing by eating you know fast food and drinking alcohol right like like like and i love to drink alcohol i think alcohol is awesome right but alcohol is bad for you like the i th the the clear scientific consensus is like there's no healthy amount okay it has no um the whole all the you know studies that you might have read in the past about um alcohol like drinkers living longer and being healthier like those were studies that did not sufficiently disentangle drinking from other behaviors like having friends and doing things that are fun right which those things do make you live longer and they are correlated with drinking alcohol but it's not the alcohol that's making you live longer it's the friends that you make it's the social support system that you build it's the the fact that you give yourself time to relax and all that kind of stuff or that you have the privilege to relax right um so like any like alcohol is like class one carcinogen right and i drink it anyway because life is choices and choices are where we balance competing interests right um and i think you don't it's it's there's there's persuasive arguments to be made for not always doing the healthiest thing right like i mean that that video that i just did about uh john harvey kellogg and like his entire philosophy of self-denial that um really i think crossed the line into masochism i mean quite quite clearly right sadism really yeah and uh not only in terms of his treatment of himself but also his treatment of his patients right um and so like yeah like longevity is not the only goal right who wants to live forever if life is hell right um if like the logic is well i can completely have a hellish experience with for these 80 years or whatever that i'm alive but then i get to have have a fantastic eternity like that's that's that's a reasonable argument right assuming that you believe that that afterlife exists but if you don't then it makes no sense at all so anyway go back get back to your question lauren your excellent question i think it's like you know what all of these professionals would tell you and what they have told me anytime i've asked them about this kind of stuff is like please do not get focused on that kind of crap because it's going to keep you from paying attention to like what's actually really affecting what what the much bigger and more important parts of your diet that definitely makes sense okay and then i think just be quickly because i also am interested in continuing the conversation regarding just like honestly meat and meat taboos and all those things but before we get to that i'm actually really interested like just because speaking of this hell that we're living in right now in this pandemic in this moment i'm wondering as a sad college student what do you think should be the building blocks for people that are struggling to feed themselves right now and not in like uh in both a financial i guess and just a depression deployment well this may sound to be in contradiction with what we were just talking about but like i based upon like my my analytics and where i see like my views are coming from the countries and and all that kind of the demographics it's like i i operate on the assumption that most of the people hearing my voice are voices right now you and me lauren most the people hearing us are people who have a problem of eating too much food as opposed to too little food right i assume that most of you are kind of overfed first worlders like like me um and so if you're not please ignore what i'm about to say because it doesn't apply to you um but if you are um you know and i think i'm i'm complicit in perpetuating this the whole kind of concept of like comfort eating um is really that's that's like that's overrated that's an overrated food trend right um over overeating usually like makes us less happy um and it it you know we feel like it's going to and it often does in the very immediate sense but um but eating too much damn food and too much unhealthy damn food you know like there's large volumes of research showing it like it makes us less happy not just because of like body image and all that kind of crap but like in terms of like more immediate kind of biochemical ways like the insulin response that we get from having way too many refined carbs in one sitting like that makes you ornery and and cranky right um that's like a real thing um that i i know i experience a whole lot like if i have a whole bunch of sugar in a couple hours i feel i i feel bad i feel um like emotionally bad um and then it gets you and then you go like hypoglycemic and like and you feel sort of bad physically too and then you what do you do you eat more sugar in order to satisfy that temporary need and thus you're you're on the carb train right and you can't get off it's this addictive cycle that is really akin to all kinds of other addictive cycles that people uh suffer from in their lives and so you know honestly like my advice is like try to get away from that kind of comfort eating thing like eat a little bit more of an uh and be a bit more of an aesthete right like i i've been eating a lot better for the last couple of weeks and i feel way better psychologically right now than i did before and i don't i have to i don't know how many times i have to go through that kind of yo-yoing in my life before i freaking remember that and figure out learn the damn lesson right but like when i eat way too many way too much junk especially way too many simple carbs i am emotionally bad and when i have a cleaner diet more more fruits and vegetables and complex carbohydrates and really just kind of watching overall caloric intake i am emotionally better and and i think that like the sort of the thing that we've done in our society where like we've reacted against kind of fat shaming and fat phobia and all that kind of stuff like that's all really good and important but we also i think it's also important to not like kind of over correct a little bit and remember that like you know eating way too much junk really does do meaningfully meaningful bad things to you totally apart from like you know fascistic body image crap that we're all indoctrinated with you know yeah i definitely agree with that and especially with the whole like restrict binge cycle that a lot of people find themselves in the diet culture definitely doesn't help when people want to just comfort eat a little bit you then you feel bad about it so anyway we won't get any further into it but no that definitely makes sense yeah just kind of thinking food is fuel food is fuel am i right um but no that makes sense i think um the next thing that i was interested in because when you were talking about kind of the vegan soul food scene that was in macon those are some of my favorite restaurants here in detroit um and i was actually wondering like just your thoughts on like the way that like the vegan movement could be going in the next few years i'm really interested in the whole idea of like a flexitarian personally and like just people eating less meat in general but yeah it's it's it's it's obviously an incredibly charged subject and my goal in answering your totally fair question right now lauren is to kind of like restrict the scope of it a little bit because i don't i don't want to i mean a we could talk forever b i want to not get into too much trouble um so so i i think i think it's the case is pretty clear that less meat eating is good in almost every way it's um you know and that which is not to say that like foods that you could replace meat with in your diet aren't couldn't also be physically injurious to you and injurious to the environment and all kinds of stuff like that like they can like it matters what you replace it with in your diet but like the case is pretty you know that in aggregate if you look at what people eat instead if they reduce meat or like it's it's a good thing for them physically and for uh for the sustainability of agriculture right um so eating less meat is something that i have you know strived to do for for many years and have succeeded like we way less meat than than we used to um and try to look at it as a special treat rather than a staple food or um looking at alternatively looking at it the way that meat eating has historically been for like most of the history of civilization where like meat is more of a flavoring right and in fact you see this in lots of extant food cultures today especially in um you know east asia and some other places where it's just like the or like i mean why am i looking a field right here in the american south like the ham hock in the pot of greens is the perfect example right um where where meat is used to kind of to help cook and to help flavor very very large volumes of plant matter very very small amounts of meat and that's like that's a perfectly good you know great way to eat too and a lot of those foods are really good and kind of kind of underrated i think the whole like giant slab of pure animal protein thing is kind of a historical aberration and and and and really should be viewed as a special treat i think i think the case for that is super strong um in terms of like veganism in particular i don't know it's that's a more kind of complicated topic and i'm sort of more interested to know what you make of it lauren um well this is like really funny because um at school um before the pandemic i was actually in a vegan vegetarian co-op i myself am not vegan or vegetarian and nor do i plan on ever going vegan or vegetarian but it really introduced me to a bunch of like produce and like just other plant proteins that i never tried before like i just didn't really grow up eating things like lentils and fennel and things like that so it was all like farm fresh and local so kind of cool and it was dirt cheap which is really why i participated um but um but no it was really cool so but i think like a lot of people they would talk about things like animal rights and stuff at the like at the co-op but i remember just being like you know i definitely feel where you're coming from but you know that's just won't be me but i think that i weigh less meat on average than i did you know before i started college and i feel like if everyone made that transition maybe things would be better it's interesting to hear what you say about how like it forced you to kind of open up to new ideas and and that's something that like you see both from like a from a culinary standpoint and from like a human health standpoint is that like when people go on any kind of restricted diet they cut out x whatever the hell x is interesting and usually good things happen right um they you know it just it causes you so it's just cutting out one category of food reduces some amount of temptation in your life right like when you're just kind of walking around and there's i mean this is not a good example for covid times but in the before times when there would be like buffets or parties or just like food out somewhere if you have told yourself that you cannot eat some broad category of stuff that might be found on that table right the the the the likely outcome is that your your tot your net intake of food is going to be lower so basically any what they find you know a lot of the research finds is that basically any kind of diet restricted diet works um in terms of you know in terms of um in terms of weight loss um and so that's an interesting example there and then from the culinary culinary perspective yeah like anything that you do any arbitrary thing that you cut out is going to force you to kind of look around for things to replace it and you can discover all kinds of great things that you just had no idea that you would have liked but they're great and your and your life is richer for them so it's good to hear that you've had that experience yeah no it was definitely cool i think that like more people should learn about or at least more like americans at least i feel like should learn about the power of beings and just like kind of rediscovering different ways to have them so no that's definitely where i was coming from with that i feel like now i know about so many different foods that i didn't even know about so that's kind of where that was coming from and then oh yes the next thing that i was interested in because people also i know americans also i feel like it's like beef poultry and pork are like the main things that people eat here and i was wondering what your thoughts are on like other all like alternative meats just like how people in other cultures have them and kind of the like people rag on other cultures for the animals that they eat yeah it's such an interesting topic that i've thought of several kind of video days that i want to do video ideas that i want to do that are down that rabbit hole um all of the the weird taboos um and all that kind of stuff and how how did we land historically how did we land on beef chicken pork as like the big three in the united states um and it's like and the thing is that it's like mo you know from from having studied the topic a little bit like you know it's ask yourself why people eat what they do where they do usually it's because it's what grows well there right or it's what you can produce efficiently wherever the hell they are that's almost always cause number one for why people eat what they do and the exception and this is not at all an exception here with the case in the united states that like you know cows are are relatively economical to raise here as our chickens as our pigs um and so that's like the chief thing but yeah it's also about like kind of taste and certainly um you know the the meat industry certainly showed a trajectory toward less intensely tasting meats for a long time right um like i i wonder how many people watching this right now who have heard the term gamey in reference to the taste of meat like even know what that is like can you can you conjure a taste memory in your head about what gaming this is i mean can you lauren um i think like i definitely have like a spectrum of gamier meets that i've had so i mean again are they even gamey i don't know but i think of like rabbit or like um you know like kind of like goat or something like that when i think of gamier meats yeah yeah yeah but like but like a lot of people watching this right now have never had duck or goat right um and i wonder if they could even know what what meat can taste like when it's not the kind of meat that has had a lot of it's specifically it's odorants um kind of bred out of it basically um yeah i i remember i had a really formative experience about that um when i was sometime in my 20s i forgot what it was but i i i was cooking thanksgiving dinner and i went to like this hipster butcher shop and i was like all right yeah give me like the heritage breed turkey and the dude was like sure like he's like he looked at this boy and he was like it was like can you are you sure you can handle this young man right um and and i was like oh hell yeah right like and i cooked it and like the the smell that it felt filled the house with was like incredible and i thought that i'd done something wrong i thought that you know i'd accidentally left the liver in there or something like that you know um but no like that's gaminess and um and those are specifically they're not they're like odor compounds that like have that breeders of of of meat animals have selected against not just recently but for generations um and that's interesting um especially considering that like while some of them you know i don't like some of them i love like freaking love sheep like mutton the meat of an adult sheep freaking amazing like goat oh my god i love it and i feel like we're missing out on on not having a lot of that um you know quickly available here though it's like it's really people you know hey of course you can get everything on the internet nowadays but there's there's an expense in having it shipped to you um it's you know it's if you have not been to um local non-western markets in your community please go and and try and like look in the frozen look in the frozen meat section and you can find all kinds of wonderful treasures if you want to kind of broaden your horizons there and then lastly i think you know certainly there's there's the kind of humanitarian view of the issue that like there's certain animals whom most humans have reconciled themselves to the idea of killing to eat and there's other animals that they have not reconciled themselves to that idea and we can talk all day about whether or not those disparities are logical and that's a very complicated and thorny topic but if you do eat meat i would encourage all of us to be open to the idea that just because it's not a cow doesn't mean that it's more cruel you know and and for example like my my neighbor down the street wilson he's he's a young guy he's a kid um so he shot a deer and he gave me some stew meat from the from the deer that i'm gonna cook it in a video coming up soon and i know that like you know people will freak out a little bit and you know what i would say is that like the moral equation of deer hunting is is interesting and probably has more nuance than you might realize like you know for example um even if like you are suspicious of the impulse to hunt and people who do that um it's also the case that like human beings have caused this horrible explosion in specifically white-tailed deer populations here in north america right deer are an edge species they thrive in um you know basically like the interface between a forested area and a uh a grassy area that is where they do well and human beings in our um development of the wilderness and chopping up forest into ever tiny tiny weirder you know you know chunks that look like gerrymandered congressional districts right um we have created huge amounts of edge huge amounts of edge and urban rural interface and all that kind of stuff where deer naturally do really really well and as a result deer populations are so much bigger than they should be um both in terms of um ecological health like that's it's bad for other species for deer to be so overpopulated it's also like bad for like humans like i mean i i don't know what it was like growing up in michigan for you lauren i imagine it might have been similar i grew up in pennsylvania where like the hazard of deer strike when you're driving is a huge thing like so many kids and like their kids in my high school died oh yeah you know hitting deer i i the biggest the worst car accident i've ever been in my life i was 17 and i um i swerved to avoid a deer that was right in the middle of the road um and i you know totaled my car and really could have died and like you know it's it's like they are a major threat to human safety and uh i think that you know i am personally grateful to people working to um you know you know it's a human problem and it requires a human solution a human intervention and maybe hunting isn't the most humane way to do it there are other ways that people have been exploring and that's a debatable topic but regardless we need fewer deer in this world because we screwed it up humans screwed it up and if we're gonna kill them then i do think we should eat them like the the the the ecological case for doing that is is unassailable right like how is it better how is it better to kill the deer and then throw it away and then have someone else kill a cow for you elsewhere and then ship it you know across the country to you on a carbon emitting means of conveyance and then you eat that instead how is that better no eat the damn deer i love it yeah and i think like as someone from michigan where opening day is like a holiday here she means hunting season for people who didn't grow up in that a first day of hunting season yes no i mean like truly like in schools i remember like i went to go to do um like my like testing or whatever just even at schools people be like oh for show and tell like here's a photo of like the deer i shot with my dad and i was like okay great um and so yeah i don't come from a hunting family but yeah i feel like i will gladly try some venison if it will help help the earth and things like that and i definitely have almost been in a couple of car accidents because of deer um so definitely they're just in our backyards here in michigan so i feel like a lot of people can probably relate to that people are probably going to become people are probably commenting right now about the lyme disease hazard posed by deer is where as well and then that's going to result in incredibly furious sub threads because there's a lot of scientific debate about the extent to which deer are actually vectors of lyme disease um so if you're going to have that debate in the comments have fun i am i am walking the other way yeah i think that's so interesting and also a fun fact about me i'm actually a history and an east asian studies major here at brown um and so like i'm also i've definitely also had that like on an intellectual level had the debate about you know the hierarchies of different meats or especially the morality of you know eating pet animals or domesticated animals that we normally would have in our homes so again won't get too into it but i definitely agree i think a lot of it is very culturally um kind of influenced for people um but yeah i think honestly like one of my biggest questions that i have and maybe you've answered this before so sorry if i'm repeating is um i'm wondering like just for all of the research that you do for your videos like where do you do it or like do you have a systematic like process for conducting it and i'm also just wondering like do you just have like a personal like jstor account or something or like just like subscriptions to different journals because it seems really high level yeah um so in terms of access to scholarly journals that are pay walled um i don't i don't subscribe to anything i pay for articles on a per article basis if there was kind of if there was one thing that i could pay for for an umbrella subscription that would get me access to most of the scientific literature i need i would totally do it but there isn't as far as i can tell um so i made the decision a while ago to simply pay on a per article basis and for people who have not done this before if you're gonna if you're buying personal access to one like scientific journal article the cost is generally going to be like between 30 and 60 bucks for that um uh just to download a pdf of a of a journal article and for me because it's part of my business like it's it's a no-brainer that's like a great a great use of money it's perfectly justified it's a write-off like it's fine um uh and i don't know i mean this is part of like a broader thing that i might say that like i don't know do doing this has helped me there's some things that like i wish i would have been more liberal about paying for for most of my life that i was too stingy about that i've become more liberal about as a result of doing what i do for a living and having it be very financially successful right like so for example like i i now have so many iphone chargers right like i just have chargers all over the house right and and the reason that like i kind of justify to myself now is like well this is what i need in order to do my work right so i just like i just bought the chargers right but like thinking back to how much of my life i spent having like one frayed ratty charger in one room that i would have to move around constantly like it's is so dumb like i and if you're a person who like legitimately cannot afford the like hundred bucks to get like you know three more chargers right um then i'm not trying to like shame you or anything like that like you got to do what you can do with what you have but like i imagine that probably most people watching this like actually could afford to buy like two more chargers and then have like so that you're not having to move them from like room to room in the house and you're all you are wasting so much of your life trying to find it and all that kind of stuff right like i just really wish that i had given myself permission to just buy more of the basic things that i need in order to function for back back in the before times of my life and and and like and buying a journal article that i need is kind of an example of that right like i think about like what would i have done in the past if i really needed the information in that article and i simply didn't allow my mind to even be open to the possibility of just paying for it right i wouldn't even consider that what would i have done instead like i probably would have just spent hours and hours and hours trying to find it for free somewhere and was that really a good use of my time like i probably could have made thirty dollars in that time right uh so anyway that was such a tangent to your question um but yeah like yeah i just i just pay for them like you know and and i and people have people people have taken my practice in that regard um as indication that i sort of tacit acceptance or embrace or approval of the academic publishing industrial complex and please do not interpret it as such i i believe that is a really messed up system i think that um you know i love the open access movement in in academic publishing which for people who are not part of this world that basically just means like people like lauren's professors at brown increasingly um publishing their scholarship not at the traditional journal publications but with open access journals that are just online and free and they're taking usually taking a hit in terms of prestige when they do that because there's a lot more prestige in publishing in the journal of the american medical association than there is in your typical medical open access journal right but they're doing it for the cause of open access and kind of breaking out of a system that really does like extract a lot of you know of profit for a select few people out of both the work of scholars and also the work of you the taxpayer who pays for a lot of the scientific research that ends up going into those journals um either directly or indirectly you pay for a ton of that so no i think it's like a messed up system on the other hand i actually don't think it's like completely illegitimate right like uh professional journals are are good and some like i like i you know the i think the work the gatekeeping role of professional um journal editors is important and valuable and somebody has to pay for them right um so i think about them when i pay i think oh okay well like you know somebody's got to pay for the parts of this industrial complex that are actually valuable and it might as well be me if it's not going to be me who the hell is it going to be right um so i yeah i just pay for them um sorry is there any more specific question about my research process i should have answered um honestly no i think that that's fine with me it is funny though as a as an undergrad student who's like probably the target demographic for people they're trying to rip off i guess if your university doesn't have a subscription i haven't paid for a pdf in years so hopefully it'll stay that way yeah dude i mean if you're if you're a college student watching please i have the cheat codes remember that you presently have access to an incredibly expensive wealth of knowledge right like your library your login at your library your school library's website gives you access to an unbelievable trove of human knowledge that you will not have access to you after you graduate like you know so if you're inclined to take advantage of that take advantage of it it's pretty special download your pdfs before you graduate folks anyway that's my message to the people um i guess the last thing that i have when you're talking about especially like just like money or like things that like you wish you had invested in or investments i would say i guess for small creators because i saw on your instagram post a couple people wanted like tips for smaller creators starting out what are some of the like i'm trying to think of like the key equipment i would say or like the key things that you think have really enhanced your process just like even not the most important things but i guess the things that come to mind so even like as small as like chargers like is there anything else like that so my basic equation that i feel that i have learned since doing this is that um lighting is more important than cameras you know here i'll here let me take my phone i will drop this in right now i'm gonna put it on widescreen mode and people can see all right there's lauren wave to people all right so there she is so here i'm going to pan across what i'm seeing um and there's the lights and blah blah okay and then there's my camera which is like that's a 5 000 camera with a 2 000 lens on it and that might be intimidating to you but please don't be intimidated by that like this would look almost as good if i just had my iphone up there really i mean what's what has a much bigger effect on the quality of what you are seeing right now is um these very inexpensive things so all of this foam that i have scattered everywhere okay um you know the the number one worst thing about amateur media projects is how you can't understand what the hell people are saying and that will improve your sound tremendously by in this case what it's doing is it's limiting echoes which is a particular challenge for me shooting in a kitchen kitchens and bathrooms have lots of um very smooth surfaces on them to enable easy cleaning right and but the problem with them is they're very reflective of sound and so yeah before i shoot i scatter a whole bunch of foam around specifically i scatter it in the direction in which i am talking because that's where it will absorb it and keep it from getting bounced around elsewhere right so like the foam is more important than the camera and the lights are way more important in the camera like and i'm i'm not one to give i'm not a person who should be giving advice on lighting i'm still i still struggle with lighting all the time it's really really hard for me but there's a million youtube tutorials to watch and you can do amazing cinematic lighting with just like the lamps that you already have in your house um so a hundred percent focus on that um you know most people have a fantastic camera with them and most people watching this right now have a fantastic camera already work with this before you work with anything else it's definitely my advice um you know the only real challenge for like a youtuber trying to shoot with a phone is the fact that you know the phone is here and the microphone is in the same place and so to put the phone where you need it to be the microphone is often not as close as you'd want it to the the source of the sound like in my case my microphone is here you know taped under my shirt and going to a completely different audio recorder but it's like so how do you resolve that um well there's like there's like just there's you know uh lightning cable lavalier microphones just like that that you can buy for like you know this you can buy them for like 30 bucks um and that's an option another option is to have a friend who has a phone um and um you know a roommate who has a phone and you take this phone put it up on your tripod over there you take your friend's phone and you put it right there and the friend's phone is recording the audio your phone is recording the video and then you sync them up in post-production afterwards which is much easier than it sounds and you know again download a youtube tutorial but that's super easy um so yeah my advice i mean i i i loved creating media for so much of my career working for non-profits and public broadcasting and stuff and like making do and being scrappy with like you know little cheap things because it's just it's kind of fun it's and it's amazing what you can do um which is not to say that like expensive cameras don't have their virtues they do but like there's definitely like a a law of diminishing returns right like the difference between a um you know an iphone and a 5 000 camera is like this and the difference between having a lamp positioned in a good spot or not is this it's this right it's just like hey this is this is how we we get closure to the conversation this is our ark is about to round watch me do it lauren um it's just like eating acai berries or whatever super food right like yes it probably is good for you but it is an infinitely smaller factor than whether or not you're drinking and eating fries all the time no okay that definitely makes sense um and honestly like i feel like both me and mike my brother were both were both college students and like interested in youtube as well and like honestly this is pretty helpful especially as someone that like you know you have a media background but like in terms of the videography aspect of it like that's different so no that's pretty helpful i would say um i think those are the end of my last of like my specific questions but thanks so much um for like just talking with me today and reaching out this is so cool thank you lauren can i ask you one question one more question before we quit absolutely so tell me about the dream cafe like what's going to be on the menu what kind of drinks oh my goodness walk me through it just like so i worked at a cafe during college so that totally influenced me but i love like very pretty aesthetic things like lavender london fogs and like you know just like kind of like fluffy pancakes and just like little summery drinks like with ginger and lemon and like edible flowers little dainty things like that i feel like after this pandemic we need some things that are just for how pretty it is and how nice it is so that's kind of where i think i want to go one day that sounds like exactly the kind of food i would love to pay someone else to make for me thank you yes so i really look forward to going to your place and paying you to do that work so that i can i want it i want it to be something that like is familiar to people but something that you would never be able to recreate if that makes sense so like your traditional pound cakes are just like little small desserts and stuff like that so yeah well anyway thanks that's the dream you guys stay tuned one day and hopefully it'll come to fruition um but yeah i think that's it though um but this is so cool good times thank you bye-bye bye everybody bye goodbye thanks for watching,3
Flautas / taquitos | corn & flour | quick bean filling,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3oFk6d7XNJ8/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLA4GHhGD9HQ0_wPETkfjRBOfEzWHA,3oFk6d7XNJ8,"6 minutes, 43 seconds","Thanks to Magic Spoon for sponsoring today’s video!

The catch with this...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.187352, flautas or taquitos are tortillas that have been filled rolled and fried crispy normally in a lot of oil i'm going to show you how you can do it in just a film of oil it's less greasy less messy and still super good i'll show you flour and corn versions and i'm not attempting any kind of mexican authenticity here in fact my filling is just gonna be this a 15 ounce can of beans a four ounce can of green chilies and about four ounces of any melting cheese this is monterey jack i know that you don't need instructions on how to open a can of beans but one good way is to dump it in your mixing bowl fill with water swish around to wash off all that canning goo and then just block them with your hand as you drain it's just like washing rice it saves you from getting a strainer dirty that was a 439 gram can 113 grams of canned chilies and about the same weight of cheese i'm just tearing it in chunks so you get distinct gooey pockets inside the flautas heterogeneity season with whatever latin spices you've got that's cumin some dried oregano some garlic powder just a little salt these things are already salty stir that up and here's a trick squish some of the beans not all of them but a few good handfuls this creates a free starch paste in there that will bind all the chunks together if you now stir it thoroughly taste it i don't think it needs any more salt the flavor to labor ratio of this filling is off the charts and hey it's meatless my condiment with this batch is just going to be some pico de gallo you could buy it in a jar if you want i'm dicing a shallot instead of an onion because i don't want a whole big onions worth one jalapeno leave the ribs in if you want it hot take them out if you don't nice and fine one tomato diced oh how i ache for real summer tomatoes this thing is terrible one or two limes juiced right in there and then some cilantro leaves if you like cilantro maybe a little sultan there's our salsa fresca i really prefer corn tortillas for flautas but they're a little trickier so i'm going to show you the flour ones first taco size a nice little log of our filling in the middle and this is not necessary but it helps if you wet your finger and melt a little sticky starch paste onto the seal end of the tortilla make sure that you position them seam side down or they'll pop right open again we've got enough filling for at least six of these this will feed three or four people depending on how heavy you make the tortilla to bean ratio you could put less filling in each and get more total food you can fry these in any large frying pan traditionally you'd partially or fully submerge them in hot oil but since i'm just gonna use a thin film i don't need steep sides so griddle i can do a ton at once on here and i don't have to get around any sides to flip things around i'm heating a film of olive oil on medium low heat and in these go seam side down we've got to set that seam before we do anything else i'm just sweeping the oil around with each one to make sure that it's got enough fat underneath it to fry it golden i might turn the heat up a bit but i'm being conservative if you brown these too fast they go prematurely rigid and burst at the seams it's safer to go slow this is a cheap griddle it heats unevenly so i'm just swapping positions to make sure that everything gets brown on the bottom you could do this in a pan but you can see why it's nice to have the space get the opposite side of each of these nice and brown going slowly on medium-low also leaves you plenty of time for the filling to get hot and for the cheese to melt if you want you can try to line them up on their sides each supporting his fellow like a row of soldiers i wouldn't try to brown the opposite side you can see the seams starting to buckle as these go crispy three brown sides is plenty crisp enough couple on a plate i like to have my condiments on the side asian style if you like if i wanted soggy tortillas i would have made enchiladas holy cow that is a rewarding weeknight meal even if it is a little bit heavy on the carbs if you need to be watching those like i do consider balancing out this dinner with a breakfast from magic spoon cereal the sponsor of this video the new cookies and cream flavor is just too good magic spoon allows me to enjoy the sweet cereal flavors of my youth without totally destroying my ever aging physique these have zero sugar per serving four or five net carbs depending on the flavor and a whopping 13 grams of protein

if you don't find the stuff to be utter magic like i do get your money back use my link and code downstairs for five dollars off thank you magic spoon alright for my corn tortilla flautas i'm going to do a different condiment some quick pickled onions or again shallots in this case i love them they have thinner layers so they pickle faster but slice these into thin semicircles before you do anything else so they have maximum time in that optional spoon or two of sugar and here's the vinegar any vinegar is fine but red wine vinegar enhances the purple color don't worry if the sugar doesn't dissolve all the way it will as you let this sit in the fridge if you can do it a day or two before even better my filling is going to be exactly the same except i'm using kidney beans just for yucks rinsed and drained a little can of any chilies for pungency and acidity the canning juice is sour which is important and some jack cheese you could use vegan cheese or you could skip it maybe pour in a little olive oil for richness instead cumin oregano garlic powder and salt stir it up and partially squish you don't need the cheese for binding because you've got that starch paste running through everything don't forget to taste for seasoning some canned beans are way saltier than others you gotta taste so corn tortillas are trickier because they're brittle there's no gluten it helps to get the ultra thin ones they're more pliable and it also helps to wrap them in a damp towel and heat them until warm and steamy the microwave is perfect that makes them even more pliable lay out a little log of filling and then here's an even better glue a little cornstarch dissolved in some water heat it until it just boils and gelatinizes this is an amazingly effective sealer on corn tortillas but as always position all their weight on top of that seam to hold it shut if the tortilla has a natural curve roll with it don't fight it these are a little smaller than the flour ones so i'm distributing the filling across eight to ten of these again olive oil on medium-low heat seam side down sweep the oil around to ensure greasy bottoms if you're nervous you could fry these one portion at a time in a pan non-stick is foolproof you can only feed a few people with this dinner anyway if you're feeding a crowd make enchiladas i have a recipe in the description i'm a person who sometimes has trouble with the mealy texture of corn tortillas but i love these because we're frying them crisp like chips i would not try to brown the sides of these they're too delicate top and bottom is fine as long as you get them nice and crispy you can turn the heat off and just store these on the griddle as it cools keeps them hot again sort of thai style i've got a little pile of cilantro leaves on the side here's my pickles after just 20 minutes in the vinegar darn good but do it hours or days in advance and they'll blow your mind just leave them in the fridge they're not preserved that gooey bean filling is amazing even if you're not a big bean person and listen to how crispy so there you go combine ideas from either recipe and have a great weeknight,3

industry that we know and love today began with this kellogg's corn flakes this is the food that launched a thousand bowls and the stated purpose of this food from the outset was to not only satisfy your hunger for nutrients but to also suppress your sexual appetite in particular to deaden your drive toward self-abuse how's that going for you the story of dr john harvey kellogg is truly one of the weirdest in food history at least weird to contemporary sensibilities the progressive era clean living movement that kellogg epitomized made a lot of sense in its historical context and kellogg turned out to be right about a lot of things maybe not so right about some others see his late career interest in eugenics and race improvement we're going to talk about kellogg's technical innovations another day today we're talking about the philosophical origins of ready to eat cereal the religion of biologic living this book is by dr brian c wilson of the comparative religion department at western michigan university yeah i got a job at western in kalamazoo in 1996 and knew absolutely nothing about michigan except for kellogg's cornflakes came from battle creek michigan indeed whole generations of kids including myself grew up knowing that cereal comes from michigan why because we did what the box told us to do we would fill out these little forms on the box offering various market research data about ourselves and then send it to an address in battle creek michigan and in exchange we would get some kind of cheap toy or prize in the mail as a result every kid in my part of the world knew about this otherwise unremarkable small midwestern city and the whole reason that battle creek is home to the kellogg's and post cereal companies is because it was first home to the seventh-day adventist church of which john kellogg's father was a founding member and seventh-day adventism is a group that believes jesus's second coming is going to happen soon and that there's going to be a millennium on earth a thousand years of peace and prosperity that only the righteous and pure will be admitted to and that definition of purity was both spiritual and physical hence the adventist interest in health care they founded the western health reform institute in battle creek and they sent young john kellogg to medical school so that he would come back and run the place which he did for the rest of his life renaming it the battle creek medical surgical sanitarium kellogg actually coined the term sanitarium which contrary to what metallica would lead you to believe has nothing to do with sanity it's sanitation kellogg was trying to emphasize the role of cleanliness in health the san as they called it for short became a hugely popular health resort for people of all faiths but kellogg ran it on his interpretation of adventist principles the adventists were biblical literalists and they believed that if if a person was going to be in the millennium or go to heaven it wasn't going to be as a disembodied spirit but as a human being with a human body and so they you really if you wanted to achieve this you had to have a pure soul in a pure body you see a lot of emphasis on bodily purity in lots of religious and social movements of the 19th century and historians have argued that this was in response to some very tangible worldly events the industrial revolution was prompting a massive social transformation from dispersed rural life to concentrated urban life way more people than ever before living really close together and spreading diseases to each other dirty water diseases like cholera dirty air diseases like tuberculosis and shall we say dirty mind diseases like syphilis and gonorrhea this urban festival of yuck was accompanied by the emerging germ theory of disease which correctly identified microorganisms spread through human and animal filth as being a major source of illness and while all that was happening industrialization was also making bodily vices more affordable and accessible than ever alcohol tobacco caffeine sugar really food in general for most of human history over indulgence has really only been possible for the highest echelons of society but advances in agriculture and industry and commerce were making it possible for 19th century normals to have way too much to eat as well and at the same time they were working increasingly in factories and offices in the city instead of toiling out in the fields and as a result they weren't getting enough exercise to boot meat in particular was becoming far more abundant in the 19th century and various religious and social reformers came to believe with good reason that meat was medically and morally problematic they were right that livestock farming and meat eating were and still are major vectors of human disease especially in these new industrialized stockyards they were getting in places like chicago not far from battle creek and these reformers were right that fatty meats in particular and also dairy can be very rough on the digestion enter the american presbyterian minister and father of vegetarianism sylvester graham for whom graham flour and graham crackers were named graham was a proponent of roughly milled whole wheat flour he was a hundred percent right that industrial over-refining of grains was stripping away a lot of the nutrition he was less right about some other things he had this entire system of of health and spirituality and it was all based on this kind of vitalist notion that human beings are born with a certain level of vital energy and once we use up our vital energy we're dead well what are the kinds of things that use up vital energy well foods that are hard to digest like meat and grease or foods that are stimulating like condiments you know cinnamon salt pepper sugar the idea was that delicious food forms part of a broader cycle of pleasure seeking a cycle that not only corrupts your eternal soul but saps your earthly body of its finite supply of vital energy thereby shortening your life the physical and spiritual cure was bland food whole wheat flour ground up mixed with water baked until hard and that was it and that's the birth of course of the graham cracker and of course we know it today with all sorts of additives with salt and sugar and you know chocolate s'mores those kinds of things but if sylvester graham were alive today to see our s'mores he'd be you know beside himself now back over in michigan dr john kellogg took graham's ideas and ran with them kellogg served his patients at the san an intentionally unenjoyable grain-based diet and he preached abstinence from all manner of bodily pleasures including sexual ones kellogg really didn't have an you know an unpublished thought indeed in this classic volume plain facts for old and young kellogg mixes scientific and moral reasoning to argue that sexual gratification of any kind should be reserved solely for baby making and except for those rare occasions husband and wife should sleep in separate beds kellogg himself walked the talk the historical consensus is kellogg probably never consummated his 40-year marriage to his wife and partner ella there's no specific indication that he was closeted he may have been what we'd described today as asexual all the couple's children were adopted of course it's also possible that kellogg's abstinence from nearly all forms of pleasure was out of sincere dedication to his moral religious and scientific beliefs for example adventists believed that adam and eve and their progeny were all vegetarians that's why they lived so long it was noah who started eating meat purely because god had wiped out all of the earth's food supply in the flood but now that the biosphere has long since regenerated kellogg felt that eating meat was unnecessary it was unhealthy and it was cruel he wrote an entire book called shall we slay to eat and it's a fascinating volume because he basically says animals are sentient beings and by slaughtering them we're essentially killing a consciousness the book shall we slay to eat is very interesting because it has these line drawings of the chicago stockyards and the slaughtering process and they're some of the books have a color overlay which is red kellogg even attempted what we would call today veganism he was an early champion of soy milk in a western world where breakfast in particular tended to be heavy on meat and dairy for good reasons on a farm you milk the cows and you collect the eggs in the morning therefore that's what you're gonna have handy at breakfast time and cured meats like ham and sausage and bacon were all things that you would have handy and that you could prepare very quickly when you wake up in the morning as opposed to breads and porridges which take hours hence kellogg's experimentation with pre-cooked grain products for breakfast but the intentionally gross concoctions that he served at the sand were tough for his patients to swallow literally reportedly one patient came to kellogg one morning and said hey that hard wheat biscuit you told me to eat broke my dentures who's going to pay for those this prompted john kellogg and his brother will to start tinkering with things that would become corn flakes now that is why modern breakfast cereals came to be how they came to be and how sugar got in there is what we'll talk about next time in the meantime you could watch the 1994 movie the road to wellville which is a highly fictionalized and kind of porny film about kellogg and the sanitarium it's good fun do you masticate mr night body do i what i have some more informative book recommendations in the description some of which you can listen to on audible the sponsor of this video behind all these triumphs the kellogg's filial relations were a mess for decades john and will fought litigated and plotted against one

squarespace here's a particularly quick and easy way to make bangers and mash there's just 30 minutes between us and this classic comfort food of the anglo-celtic isles and it could easily be meatless there's great plant-based sausages on the market now and my gravy is not going to be based on a meat stock but on this shockingly delicious yeast extract i'm using half a kilo just over a pound of yukon gold potatoes for two portions i usually don't peel varieties with smooth papery skins like this they don't bother me and there's a lot of nutrition in there just clank those up into small chunks so they'll boil quickly in the pot they go cover with water and the lid so it comes to a boil faster over high heat sausage these are ostensibly irish bangers i usually prefer smaller bangers than these little bangers cook quicker and get more brown surface area proportionally i say use absolutely any fresh sausage you like i do this with spicy italian sausages all the time and for the classic onion gravy i gotta use a shallot instead a big one like this or a couple smaller ones for a couple portions shallots have much thinner layers so we can caramelize them a lot faster than other onions especially if we slice them very thin too a little oil in the pan get it heating a little less than medium i'd say and in the shallots go the potatoes are boiling lid off so it doesn't bubble over the key to caramelizing onions is to never stop stirring them if you do the ones on the bottom are going to go crispy while the ones on top are still white you got to cook them very evenly by moving them which is fine because we have nothing else to do right now in this process and because these are shallots it only takes five or six minutes to get them like that that's good enough i'm just gonna push them all over to the far side of the pan and it's time to drop a banger one big one like this per person is enough i think don't forget to nudge those shallots a little bit to make sure they aren't burning on the bottom in fact i'm gonna push my pan over so they're literally off the heat and i like to get as much browned area on the sausage casings as possible you can roll them over hold them there for a second until they stick to the pan then let go and or you can just roll them around continuously this works just like constantly flipping a steak works the crust gradually builds all over i've been browning these for about seven minutes again over medium medium low heat so i don't burn the fond which i will now deglaze from my gravy i'm just using water we have plenty of sweetness in there already from the caramelized onions and we're gonna get plenty of meaty flavor from marmite a byproduct of the british brewing industry i think it tastes a little weird by itself but a giant spoonful of it is great in gravy it's packed with glutamates all the umami you could need for thickening i'm going to use cornstarch the trick with this is to make a slurry first i've got a couple of tablespoons there and a little water and just use your finger to stir that around and smoosh any little lumps you feel in there we might use all this we might not you gotta stir as you drizzle it in or it'll clump hopelessly it thickens as soon as it approaches a boil thicken your gravy as much as you want i tend to overshoot the mark because it's easier to water it down again later and i like having a lot of gravy grind in a whole bunch of pepper and lastly i'm going to put a big spoonful of english mustard in there if you don't like mustard i would do a splash of vinegar you need something to brighten this up give it a taste the marmite is salty so we only need a little more salt and now we can just let those sausages simmer in the gravy until they're cooked inside everything is done all at the same time in one pan now we got a bunch of green onions here because the flavor of mash i'm making today is known in ireland as champ it's mash filled with green onions i'm slicing them very thin in the white area because those parts need more cooking as i get up into the greens i'll cut wider pieces potatoes are starting to fall apart when i poke at them time to drain them through the pot lid as big a knob of butter as you can live with a conservative splash of milk and a pinch of salt for starters get that all mashed up add more milk if it's too thick then in goes all of those green onions i don't know if it's traditional to use this much for a couple of portions but i love it i want it to be like coal cannon but with onions instead of cabbage the heat of the potatoes will cook these a bit knock back some of the pungency but they'll still be a little crunchy which i love it serves as the green vegetable of the meal need some more salt and that's good onto the plate with a big well in the center for gravy you can just cut into the sausage to make sure it's cooked through or take its temperature 160 fahrenheit 70c and time for that hot hot gravy shot for some reason i like the more translucent look of cornstarch with bangers in match as opposed to making a roux with flour that is a champion winter weeknight meal right there assembled in

Free shipping within the U.S....,2022-12-01 14:47:05.187352, what even is high fructose corn syrup and why is it in everything these days and why are so many people freaked out about it well high fructose corn syrup starts off as regular corn syrup kind of like this then the corn refining industry uses enzymes derived from bacteria to convert much of the glucose here into fructose why because fructose tastes way sweeter than glucose does sweeteners of all kinds are expensive and if food manufacturers use the high fructose stuff they can make their products just as sweet for less money also more sweetness for fewer calories i suppose it's actually kind of shocking how not sweet regular corn syrup is i experienced this recently when i was doing a bunch of experimental brownie recipes i made a batch where i replaced the sugar with corn syrup by weight and i even accounted for the fact that the corn syrup is about 25 water i upped the quantity proportionally these came out flat and gummy perhaps because of the extra water and they were so under sweet as to be kind of disgusting it was like eating a packing material if you want to substantially replace sugar with corn syrup in your food you kind of have to make the corn syrup sweeter and why would you want to replace sugar with corn syrup in your food well again because it's cheaper or at least it can be cheaper depending on where you are you can only grow sugar cane in very wet hot climates brazil is perfect for it they're the biggest sugar cane producer on earth now here in the united states it's really only possible in the deep southeast florida louisiana texas up north you can grow sugar beet and indeed sugar beet accounts for about half of u.s sugar production and when i said sugar that time i meant specifically this sucrose sucrose is a disaccharide two monosaccharides bonded together one glucose and one fructose holding hands basically the sugar produced here in the united states is generally about half beets half cane and its price is artificially inflated via a complex government system of price controls and import tariffs and production quotas those familiar with the intricacies of the federal government's sugar program could be forgiven for wondering whether they had been led astray by their history books and it was actually the soviet union's ideology that prevailed in the cold war so writes the libertarian cato institute in their denunciation of u.s sugar policy these are policies with historical roots in the earliest years of the country when southern sugar barons enslaved human beings and used the fruits of their toil to buy politicians it is not a pretty history in contrast the price of corn maize here in the united states is kept artificially low i mean corn has always been cheap and easy to grow it is after all indigenous here right but since the depression in the 1930s the federal government has also paid billions and billions of dollars in subsidies directly to farmers of corn and other grains corn is just so cheap and abundant here which is why scientists for decades have worked to try to make things out of it beyond just grits and animal feed the white fluffy starch inside a kernel of corn is a combination of amylose and amylopectin which are both just huge branches of glucose thousands of glucose units all stuck together when the glucose is all branched out like that we cannot taste it or at least we cannot taste it as sweet we eat it and it goes into our system and it gets broken down into glucose and then absorbed into our body where it is used as calories energy fuel that's a good thing if you need it it's a bad thing if you don't corn refiners use a combination of acid and enzymes to break the starch down into smaller or simpler carbs that we can taste primarily dextrose which is a kind of glucose and that process has been around since the 19th century it wasn't until the 1960s when japanese and american industries working in collaboration figured out a new enzymatic process to convert some of the glucose into fructose now the american processed food industry had a product that was as sweet as sugar but far cheaper to make and because it's already in solution it's cheaper to work in a factory you can pump it around the plant through pipes this is why high fructose corn syrup is nearly ubiquitous in processed foods despite persistent and well-publicized health concerns are those concerns the overblown pseudoscience of hippie mom bloggers some of them maybe but there is some real science there too that we should talk about i do wonder if the stigma is why as near as i can tell it is impossible to buy high fructose corn syrup by itself at a grocery store this is why i had to order a 5 gallon bucket obviously intended for commercial operations the 55 does not mean this weighs 55 pounds though it does happen to weigh almost exactly 55 pounds very heavy rather the 55 here indicates that 55 of the dry weight in this bucket is fructose it tastes extremely sweet and silky smooth as smooth as my new sheets from the sponsor of this video helix sleep let's thank them i've been sleeping on our new helix mattress for a while it came to our door miraculously compacted in a box and it re-aerated itself into one of the most comfortable beds i've slept on we took their quiz we told them how we usually sleep and we got something that is sinky enough for me but firm enough for lauren i just got some new accessories for it a pad that makes it cooler to the touch because it is hot af down here we got these crazy soft sheets and some more helix pillows lauren is incredibly picky about pillows and she loves these i like it because it's fluffy and supportive but still sort of flattens out because i sleep on my stomach you can try a helix mattress yourself risk free they give you a hundred night trial to make sure that you like it do us both a favor and use my link in the description to save up to 200 on your helix sleep mattress plus you get two free pillows that's helixsleep.com thank you helix now high fructose corn syrup and health the american corn refining industry has spent a huge amount of money to communicate to you and me that sugar is sugar is sugar and if you are becoming unhealthy by eating high fructose corn syrup that's because you're eating too much sugar period and you should cut back and you know what there's probably a lot of truth to that but because the industry has already delivered that message to you quite effectively i'm going to try to give you the best argument to the contrary there is a lot of research showing that fructose is processed differently by our body than other simple carbs and sure fructose is natural it literally means fruit sugar it's found in all kinds of fruits like this tomato tomato as a fruit good tomatoes have a lot of fructose in them that's why they're sweet but just because something is naturally occurring doesn't mean that it can't be bad for you and very rarely in the fruit world do you get concentrations of fructose this intense or ratios of fructose to glucose that are so out of balance science says glucose enhances the absorption of fructose in our guts so when we eat glucose and fructose in roughly equal proportions we generally are able to digest it just fine some popular fruits like apples naturally have way more fructose than glucose in them but most others have roughly equal glucose to fructose ratios as does table sugar there when we eat more fructose than glucose the result is called excess free fructose in our guts which you might have trouble digesting some people in particular seem to be fructose mal absorbers let me introduce you to somebody this is luanne to christopher about 20 years ago she found herself rushing her daughter to the hospital with blue lips awful asthma this little girl had really scary stuff you know she had all these symptoms we thought it might be food related we took her to an allergist the allergist said eliminate corn we did that we had no uh results when we eliminated anything with the word corn syrup high fructose corn syrup was when we had our breakthrough and it made no sense indeed what does sugar in your digestive system have to do with your lungs right and this happened just around the time when high fructose corn syrup production and consumption was peaking in the united states it was everywhere and widely regarded as nutritionally indistinguishable from sucrose but when luanda christopher's daughter stopped eating high fructose corn syrup her lungs got better now most parents would be perfectly satisfied and convinced by that purely anecdotal correlation not luanne so i returned to school got a masters in biochemistry molecular biology i have collaborated with a nutritional epidemiologist dr tucker at the university of massachusetts lowell and and with her i've conducted numerous studies i want to stress this is not work that is appearing in earthy crunchy conspiracy theory blogs this is appearing in peer-reviewed major scientific journals findings that have since been reproduced by other research teams this research shows that if you are a person who has trouble absorbing fructose excess free fructose hangs around in your gut where it is highly reactive with other stuff in there it then goes on to interact with your proteins it undergoes a reaction known as glycation you form these immunogens they're tiny uh they are you know can become absorbed are in your systemic circulation travel throughout all your tissues and uh your your your lungs have a high concentration of these receptors that are mediators of asthma and what do they do they promote airway mucus hyper secretion your your your your airways get filled with mucus hence asthma chronic bronchitis and potentially other allergy type symptoms other research has indicated now hold on some people might say people might say hey what about apple juice apple juice is a product that naturally has an elevated fructose to glucose ratio apple juice isn't giving kids asthma thing is it actually might be not in everybody obviously scientists are still working on this there may be a genetic component to fructose malabsorption it might have to do with the microbiome in our guts maybe things we're doing to our bodies antibiotics messing with the bacteria that help us to digest sugars nobody knows but kids do seem to be disproportionately affected kids of color here in the united states seem to be disproportionately affected for reasons that are no doubt multifactorial and this is an area of emerging research that we should all probably be paying attention to oh and don't be thinking that all these hip new alternatives are automatically going to solve your problems for you like agave syrup agave syrup has lots of excess free fructose now remember i am not a scientist i am just a nerd who likes to eat i have a lot of confidence in the ability of science to expose the truth over the long arc of history but in the meantime some very very moneyed interests have a lot at stake in us all believing that sugar is sugar is sugar i mean just read the wikipedia article on high fructose corn syrup you're going to find tons of citations to studies that find that sugar is sugar in the body i do not reject these studies most food science is industry funded and not all of that science is industry funded this is just the way it is and maybe by and large sugar is sugar is sugar but there is reason to believe that at least in some people consuming lots of fructose in excess of glucose could be a problem and food manufacturers do not have to tell us how much excess free fructose is in their food it is commonly believed that soft drink manufacturers use this kind of corn syrup 55 fructose but independent analysis from the university of southern california finds the fructose content of drinks is often much higher than that and even the total sugar content of the drinks is often higher than what's shown on the nutrition label so we don't even know what we're consuming what we can say for sure is that high fructose corn syrup like msg takes really really inexpensive garbage foods and it renders them freaking delicious i should probably be eating less of them you do you i just dropped my spoon in there did you get it,3

***AMERICAN CHEESE RECIPE, SERVES 2-3***

Ingredients:...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.187352, in mexican-american restaurants particularly in the southern u.s they serve this cheese dip simply called queso dip or queso blanco it is truly the milk of the goddess i'm going to show you one way they make it in the restaurants then i'm going to show you a couple other ways that you might make it instead there's only a few core ingredients for liquid i found i get the best taste and texture with evaporated milk that is milk that has had some of its water boiled away at low temperature in a vacuum pan i think some people use cream instead that's good regular milk or water have yielded disappointing results for me i recommend this evaporated milk about 100 ml half a cup doesn't need to be precise then cheese monterey jack cheese is the classic mexican american cheese but lots of semi-firm cheeses could work cheddar would be fine and it would melt faster if i graded it but i don't feel like getting the greater dirty so i'm just tearing in chunks i've got maybe 100 or 120 grams of that four ounces or so then the key ingredient american cheese or any kind of processed cheese slice held together with emulsifying salts in this case sodium phosphate others might use sodium citrate i believe the white colored american cheese is more commonly used for this i'm just tearing in like three slices to start with 50 or 60 grams some restaurants probably use only american cheese that'd be fine but there's enough sodium phosphate in here to emulsify some jack cheese in there as well if you can't get processed cheese slices keep watching i have multiple solutions for you a little knob of butter in there for extra richness that's optional and obviously skip it if you're using cream now i'll just turn the heat on like medium high and be sure to stir this as it melts if you don't stir the emulsion will not form you'll end up with fat floating on top of water lots of so-called copycat recipes for restaurant style queso dip tell you to use starch to stabilize and thicken this stuff usually cornstarch if you did that you would not need those emulsifying salts but the result is really disappointing in my opinion you get a gross powdery texture as opposed to this unnaturally smooth and gooey texture that you only get with modern science i think it needs some more salt to work as a dip and obviously you could stir in any herbs or spices that you want the mexican place that lauren and i go to in georgia stops right here the place my mother-in-law goes to in tennessee flavors the dip with this some kind of canned or pickled green chili any kind works but you can tell that place up in tennessee is only mixing in the juice they must use the solid chili bits for something else you get that chili flavor and a little acidity without disrupting the smooth texture but now you've added some water so you might want to thicken it back up a little bit with more cheese remember it'll thicken a lot as it cools if you overshoot the mark you can just stir in some more liquid and that's done truly milk of the goddess that is a skin will form on the surface as it cools totally normal and it'll dissolve right back in again if you stir it oh like my glasses they're from the sponsor of this video warby parker all my glasses have been from warby parker for years the glasses there start at just 95 bucks they have a huge selection of sexy frames you can filter by type and then they'll send you some to try on at home totally free let's see what lauren thinks oh i like those i like those you have cheese on your lip oh

warbyparker.com regucia thank you warby parker now these recipes i'm giving you in the description make two dishes about this size of queso so it's enough for like two or three people you could obviously multiply for a party now the obvious alternative to making queso dip with processed cheese slices is to order your own emulsifying salts online this is sodium citrate i use it all the time and once you have it this is definitely the easy way i'm just tearing in maybe 200 grams of jack cheese more this time because now we're not using the american cheese about half a teaspoon of sodium citrate two or three grams doesn't have to be precise and then like half a cup of evaporated milk again about a mls be sure to stir as it melts ions from the emulsifying salts replace ions in the casein proteins in the cheese and milk and some more science stuff happens and then boom a silky gooey emulsion starch does not do that taste it might not need any salt because the sodium citrate is salty flavor it however you want then it's done but what if you don't want to order a whole thing of sodium citrate well you can make some at home by combining citric acid from lime juice and sodium bicarbonate baking soda this absolutely does work i'm just juicing like three of these limes i need 40 or 50 mls maybe a third of a cup or a little more it's all a guess because this is a natural product we can't know exactly how much citric acid is in here but i'll stir in like half a teaspoon of sodium bicarb two or three grams and watch science happen at first this reaction creates carbon dioxide and some water stirring helps dissolve everything and it pops the bubbles before this bubbles over on you once it's done foaming it's really cold because science and i think the reactions that get you sodium citrate keep happening over a few minutes after the foaming is over i get better results if i let this keep doing whatever it's doing for like five minutes during which time you might turn on the heat and boil off some of the extra water we've introduced here just don't take it too far if it reduces to the point where it starts to brown it tastes pretty gross now i'll put in like 80 ml of evaporated milk just a little less to account for the moisture already in there and don't worry about the acid curdling the milk the acid doesn't exist anymore it's been neutralized in goes about 200 grams of jack cheese again seven or eight ounces stir and heat until smooth please do not ask me whether we've created trisodium citrate or monosodium citrate i have no idea this is hardly precise chemistry we're doing here i just know that i've done this a bunch of times and it works beautiful gooey emulsion again doesn't need any additional salt we've got sodium from the baking soda and i'll go ahead and stir in the chili chunks with the pickling juice this time and maybe some cilantro you could do diced tomatoes olives all kinds of things go in here now does that have some noticeable lime flavor in it yes it does is that a bad thing i don't think so this is my favorite batch of the three get some tortilla chips and try it yourself,3

a whole bunch of carbs under a microscope see what it looks like chips bread whatever cheetos are right here is what most of this starts with a solitary kernel of grain wheat in this case that looks like a seed doesn't it because it is a seed humans primarily eat seeds this is a counter of seeds wheat corn rice these are all the seeds of grass plants that line down the middle of the wheat is called the crease that's where it had previously stuck to the flower of the wheat plant and then these little hairs over here called the brush this is the remnants of the stigma from the flowers try to cut it open through the crease there now you can see the fluffy white stuff inside kind of looks like mashed potatoes that's the endosperm or the the starch that's the the part that is tasty the part that basically all of these things are made out of just the calorie part that's the carbs the endosperm down here in the corner i believe we see the germ that's like the actual embryo of the plant that's where a lot of the real nutrition is historically the reason that you milled out the germ and the bran is that it contained fats and fats go rancid in time so uh milling that stuff off just going straight down to the white fluffy parts there uh makes your flour last longer it's historically why we have white rice white flour all that kind of stuff if that crease on the wheat kernel looked familiar it's probably because you might have seen them on a rolled oats naturally a grain of oat looks almost identical to a grain of wheat it's just a little bit longer and pointier the way they arrive at these flat little guys is they just they pass them through a pair of metal rollers makes them cook quicker we look at a kernel of corn maze same basic deal lines those striations running up against it it's so striated it's ripped this corn try cutting that in half there you can see the germ really clearly there the concentric layers of it there look like leaves because that's what they are that's called the plumule it's the the shoot that is ready to spring forward with a a new corn plant to be fed by all of the energy the starch that's in the endosperm there so of course if you grind the grains of wheat up into a powder you get flour this is whole wheat flour whole wheat meaning that they have not removed all of the bran and germ it's not just endosperm although you can see that the endosperm is still the majority of the bulk in there all those little white flakes that's just starch endosperm but the big kind of chunks of brown stuff that's going to be the bran coat and little bits of germ that little speck of green i wonder if that was a piece of the straw that got in there i have some wheat growing in the backyard you want to see it yep that's wheat and if you harvest the seeds and grind them down into a powder you get this this is whole wheat bread right look at the crust first and look at that it just looks like a web like a spider's web uh and i think that what we're seeing there is the the gluten structure as those gluey proteins in wheat look past the crust a little bit there and then wow look at that it looks like some kind of hr giger thing right it looks like a egg sac network of egg sacs looking in the sort of flesh of the bread there you can see all those little brown specks little shards of uh of wheat bran and germ it's that giant thing oh that must be a seed i think this bread has some like whole rando seeds in it but remember it's all seeds look at it from the side wow it's just a network of caverns where gas and steam and stuff built up as it was baking of course if you mill off the bran and germ and everything and you only make bread from the endosperm you get white bread wonder bread the whitest of breads look at the crust first again doesn't look that different right i mean because ultimately the crust is brown because of the bake because of the the browning reactions that happen at very high heat that you only get on the exterior of the bread turn around look on the inside look at the little brown specks i suppose that is a little bit of wheat bran like they're not able to mill it all out there's still a little bit left it's funny how when you think about at least in american english we would commonly call this white bread and this wheat bread which is funny because they're both wheat bread right they're both made with wheat this is whole wheat bread we simply truncate that phrase by taking out the whole part and just saying it's wheat bread i suppose like a more logical truncation or shortening of that would have been to call it whole bread and this i don't know not whole bread it's kind of more accurate to think of it that way and for contrast here's like a loaf of you know real bread like bread from a bakery not from a factory you can see that fine white flour around the top look on the bottom the base of the bread that looks geological doesn't it that of course is the cornmeal cornmeal used in baking basically is a lubricant just to keep it from sticking to the peel that they used to transfer the the bread into the oven that really looks like mars tear it open fluffy starch just looks like mashed potatoes by way of comparison let's look at some mashed potatoes basically the same stuff i mean a potato is not technically a seed it's still the thing that the new plant grows up out of and therefore it has energy stores in the form of starch and in fact i made this mash from my latest box of hellofresh the sponsor of this video and america's number one meal kit we got the low calorie plan this week because you know february everything in here was super tasty and honestly just having the boxes show up at the house kind of nudges us to make real food more often instead of just eating quick junk and that's probably better for us regardless of which particular meal plan we are on whether it's vegetarian or family friendly whatever the meals only take like half an hour to cook there's no going to the grocery store there's no buying huge boxes of stuff that you might not use all of everything is pre-portioned which makes a hello fresh meal like this a lot less wasteful there's actually a university of michigan study that found that the carbon footprint of a meal like this is actually lower than a comparable one that you cooked from groceries and the recipes are consistently terrific and very satisfying you want to try it do us both a favor and go to hellofresh.com use code 10 adam ragusia to get 10 free meals including free shipping that's 10 free meals with my code 10adamragucia hellofresh.com thank you hellofresh so i've got a couple different kinds of pasta here she's just like a pretty standard linguine dried and then here imported from italy linguine cut with a bronze dye meaning extruded through a dye made of bronze rather than stainless steel or coated with teflon i've heard about so here's the bronze dye linguine and then here's the kind of standard linguine look at how much smoother that is in theory this is superior the bronze dye one because it creates a more of a textured surface that will hold more sauce on the noodle that's something that we should test another day a little letter pasta for soup just curious to see what this is very chuffed up surface you wonder if that's just from them uh grinding against each other in the bag a for adam look at one with ridges on it this or a caddy these are bronze cut as well those ridges they look like arches up close side of a church or something the italians would like that very different kind of pasta thai style rice noodles looks like bugs or snakes or something and again little specks of bran from the rice grain still left in there so brown rice rice that it's had its outer hull removed but the bran code is still reasonably intact remember of course that that bran coat has fat in it the fat will go rancid in time so historically people just grind this down to grind away the outer layers get rid of them and then you have white rice you can definitely tell the difference but yeah you can still see little bits of brown bran left that didn't get milled off and from the side white rice looks like a larva doesn't it and see that part in the end that's kind of scooped out a little bit of each one that's where the the germ was popped out of there broken out through milling now what is this is this some kind of grain of rice i mean it says rice on the box not really rice krispies are not grains of rice that have been like toasted and fluffed up it's like a dough that they make out of ground up rice flour and sugar and stuff the modern breakfast cereal industry began with these kellogg's cornflakes in a 19th century in michigan in the united states a guy named john kellogg had a sanitarium or a place where he would heal people ostensibly and he created this food for them basically by like cooking grains in water the way you normally would uh but then drying them and then pressing them through rollers just like those rolled oats to make these little flakes ultimately it was uh john kellogg's brother will who saw the commercial potential for these hey we should put sugar in these and that caused a rift between the two brothers that uh never healed let's look at something really profane like froot loops it's just easy to forget with all of these highly processed breakfast cereals that they're all just grains seeds remember seed pastes they're all seed pastes in this case it's mostly corns with you know sugar and flavorings and colorings and stuff in them not that i'm complaining i love this stuff i mean something like frosted mini wheats is slightly less like processed the wheat has not been like turned into a paste or a flour or a dough and then shaped it's the actual like wheat berries have been passed through a thing that kind of looks like a paper shredder that looks gnarly up close look at that just a forest of starch look at the sugar side oh sweet sugar wow you can almost see the crystals on the frosting the one other one i really want to see is cinnamon toast crunch certainly my childhood favorite oh those big crystals of sugar you can see them little square crystals of sugar that's why it's good of course they have those cereals in things like you know chex mix hey it's it's a wholesome breakfast right it's got cereal in it look at that it's like being in carb prison i think that's salt see those little kind of white crystals that's got to be the salt right there's other things in here of course there's like the little brown things that kind of look like melba toast i don't know what that is but yet look at the salt crystals in there it's like the fortress of solitude the last interesting thing to look at in here is pretzels there's little bits of pretzel so the way that they get pretzels to look like they do is by taking the dough and then boiling it in a highly alkaline solution basically pre-cooks the starch a little bit before it then bakes and so you get this very dark brown smooth layer i'm curious to see if these other snack foods will have similar salt crystal shapes lay's classic potato chips i don't see any salt in there teeny tiny crystals it must be i wonder if i backlight the chip one thing you can see is the is the bubbles the steam inside the potato wow look at that it's like the lava try something different try the pringles potato chips not actually made out of slices of potato but rather potato flour potato starch basically that has been just made into a dough and then shaped into these perfect little ellipses or whatever that's called in three dimensions i don't know and there if we look at it from the side yeah those are salt crystals right little teeny ones all right here's something that's definitely going to be visible doritos right just a corn tortilla chip with uh all kinds of seasoning on it there we go looks like christmas okay now i see something i believe that is msg monosodium glutamate which of course is why doritos taste so tasty because if you look at pure msg which uh in the united states is sold under this brand name accents you can buy it at the store just msg crystals are always whenever i've seen them little bars like that like that all right now the grand finale cheetos just another corn dough that has been fried and topped with a cheese powder i was little i ate a bunch of these and then ejected them never been able to eat them since and i guess my takeaway there is like it kind of looks like everything else on this counter right it looks like the bread it looks like everything because all of these things are just seed pastes that have been cooked go enjoy your seed paste and uh i guess i have plenty to enjoy myself,3
Rolled chicken breasts with chorizo stuffing and green beans,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EWgezGndMMU/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLAeK4ysB5xytH7Yoo24ekOhCJ1UuA,EWgezGndMMU,"7 minutes, 34 seconds","Thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this video!

squarespace so this is a little bit of work but it's a fun way to make the chicken breast interesting again just make a quick stuffing and roll it up i'm making two big portions and i'm starting with like a 50 gram chunk of dry chorizo you could use any sausage at all but if you're using fresh sausage not dried you'd want almost twice as much because it'll boil off water the key with the dry sausage for stuffing is cutting it into the smallest pieces possible i'm just sawing thin strips and from there saw into matchsticks and from there saw into a fine dice i do find a back and forth sawing motion works much better than a chopping motion with dry sausage man i love chorizo smoky garlicky red flavored i don't know it's awesome the iberian peoples know from sausage and here's a shallots any form of onion is fine but we only need a little and shallots are small so one shallot very fine grab a pan and i'll throw those in cold and turn the heat on medium underneath them fat will render out of the sausage in time to cook the shallots i'll just stir those every now and then meanwhile i can prep my chicken one side of a breast per person and it's time to butterfly them i'm just cutting into the thickest parts very carefully and open it up i'll show you that from the side heading into the thickest part trying to cut its height in half stop before you go all the way through and open it up like a book if you've got thick parts you can kind of make slits across them and or lay some plastic over to prevent splattering while you pound them out focusing your attention on the thick parts the thin parts will need hardly any smashing for years before i had this meat pounder i used a heavy bottomed pint glass that's fine as long as you don't hulk smash it i'll just get the meat as flat as i can without tearing it apart done back over at the stuffing the shallots look pretty cooked if using fresh sausage you'd want to get it looking pretty dry and crumbly now i'll pour in a roughly equal quantity by volume of breadcrumbs this is panko because that's pretty much the only kind i keep around anymore but any breadcrumb is fine i've done this with cornbread crumbs before that was amazing i'll just let that toast a little for flavor and then it's time to deglaze the pan these mini bottles of white wine are quite convenient for cooking you could use water with maybe a splash of vinegar at the end to taste instead there's still some brown stuff over there to get off i want that flavor but i also want enough moisture in the pan to make the breadcrumbs moldable just barely moldable off the heat that comes and since i'm going to have my chicken with lemon i might as well put a little zest in the stuffing it really freshens up the chorizo as will a bunch of fresh herb i'm using dill because i have some and i like it but thyme or parsley would be great stir that up taste it it only needs a little more salt because the chorizo is so heavily seasoned very nice still crumbly if it was really wet it would be kind of gummy in the end and before i roll this up i'm going to do myself a favor and cut a bunch of strands of butcher's twine get it done now while my hands are clean each piece is long enough to wrap around the chicken and tie a knot and i'd say five strands per piece keep those scissors we'll need them again now stuffing onto the cut side of each piece of meat this piece is a little bit bigger so i'll need a little more keep that pan we're going to use it again this is a one pan dinner and then whichever side is more tattered is the one i want to hide inside the roll so stuffing all the way to that end and then roll it up i've left a little strip uncovered there at the end to make a seal done and because we topped the cut side of the meat the firmer and smoother surface is now the outside of the roll which is good this one is not going to work rolling in the same direction no worries i'll just roll this from the tail instead this is good because it'll get me a piece of about the same thickness even though it's smaller it'll cook in the same time there looks like a pig's trotter now i'm just going to wiggle my first length of twine underneath there and do a surgeon's knot that's where you go across and then under once that's an overhand knot and then you go under again pull taut and the extra friction we get from going under twice holds it for us while we lock it off with a normal overhand knot easy repeat i wish i could tell you that you could just secure these with a toothpick down the middle or something but that just doesn't work chicken breast is too delicate and irregular the toothpicks aren't secure enough but this isn't too hard i snip off the excess just to keep it out of my way it looks like a couple of lobster tails now and if you were making these for the in-laws or something you could do this much the night before and put them in the fridge i'm ready to cook these right now so i'll get some salt all over these pan back over medium or medium-low heat and coat with olive oil let it get hot and i'll lay in the chicken and this part would probably be easier in a non-stick pan in a stainless pan you got to really let each surface sear firm before you nudge it off the pan or else it'll shred i'm getting a little bit of shredding whatever i'm just gently coloring all sides and at this point you could throw the pan in the oven i would only do that if my oven was already hot for something else instead you could throw some butter in the pan melted and just kind of roll them around in there i think that does the same thing as basting it just doesn't look as sexy but it still takes a long time to get the inside of these up to temperature for this particular recipe i found the best things to cover them you don't have a lid some foil is fine just let them steam in there the rest of the way check on them frequently and roll them around about 15 minutes after they went in this smaller one is approaching 160 fahrenheit 70 c i actually wished i'd pulled these a little sooner carry overheat is going to raise these like 10 degrees fahrenheit as they rest unless you really need to play it safe i'd say pull these no further than 155 or 68c those can just rest while we make our side i'm dumping out any burned bits of stuffing that fell out and the butter if it's looking burned but that fond on the bottom is looking golden and perfect so back on the heat it goes and in goes a bunch of green beans i think that was a six ounce bag 170 grams they taste even better if you let them fry a little bit in the dry heat i should have done that a little bit longer but eventually you got to deglaze i'm using the rest of my mini bar bottle there again water would be fine with a little splash of vinegar at the end instead just scrape that pan clean get all those beans coated and on goes my makeshift lid heat up to high just let them steam maybe five minutes but check on them frequently because if too much of that liquid evaporates it'll burn instantly i'm just tossing in some water whenever needed keep steaming taste one to check for doneness and seasoning some pepper and salt and a little more thyme the easiest way to get these strings off is to snip them with clean scissors and then peel them off get rid of them this is not necessary but some fresh butter in the green beans at the very end is nice just to make a thicker sauce with the panju off the heat now it's really important to slice this up with a freshly sharpened knife otherwise the meat fibers will just shred you'll have done all this decorative work for nothing but look how pretty those are little meaty pinwheels when it's time to transfer this to the plate you can just kind of mash it back together press and lift and deposit fan those out a little to show off get those green beans this is my new favorite thing cooking my vegetable in the pan with the fond while the meat rests synergistic and then last and not optional at all in my opinion is a lemon wedge this is the sauce for the chicken gotta have it get that darn seed out of my thumbnail you know it's not an everyday dinner but it's a fun little project and a way to get creative with chicken breast you could stuff it with all kinds of things and those green beans glisten like a new website

"The argument for cooking with volume measurements, rather than weight",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/04ID_Qdm1Q8/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLBQS5Wm6cE-LzC1SMpC6fGfq1XYXQ,04ID_Qdm1Q8,17 minutes,"Become smarter in 5 minutes by signing up for free today: https://cen.yt/mbadamragusea2 — Thanks to Morning Brew for sponsoring this video!

My old video about why the U.S. hasn't fully adopted...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.187352, in the home kitchen i think that measuring ingredients by volume is good i think measuring ingredients by weight is also good i could easily make that argument but everybody makes that argument these days don't they the celebrity chef phenomenon has taken tons of methods and values from the professional kitchen and it's foisted them upon the home kitchen where i think many of those methods have limited applicability the pros like to measure by weight i like to measure by volume and i have five reasons for that or possibly six we'll get to that but first we need to establish that this is not a metric versus imperial debate all widely used measurement systems in the whole world have units of volume and units of weight you totally can measure out a hundred milliliters of flour even though nobody does that most people watching this in the metric world right now i would probably call this about 50 grams of flour likewise the united states system of customary measurements that evolved here from the british imperial system has both weight and volume measurements we got them both i would call this half a cup of flour but you could call it about two ounces of flour the ounce is a unit of weight not to be confused with the fluid ounce which is a unit of volume that is legit confusing a cup is eight fluid ounces a fluid ounce is the volume that would be occupied by one ounce of water by weight roughly that volume or an ounce of wine in merry old england just a fun historical fact there but anyways yes it's absolutely true that people here in the united states are more likely to measure stuff by volume than say our peers over in europe who pretty much all have kitchen scales but that fact is not inherent to our respective systems of measurement you can do weight or volume in either system so why is volume still kind of popular here in the states as far as i can tell nobody knows but here's a hypothesis from dr stephen mim a historian at the university of georgia who is working on a book about the history of measurement systems in the us in the early 20th century the the federal government created something called the bureau of standards it fanned out across the country and it did a bunch of tests on shopkeepers and restaurants and places where people were using measures and that you know how much does this pint really measure and they actually knew how much a pine was supposed to be and they found that every single measure almost without exception was off oftentimes to the detriment of people buying things at the deli counter or at a grocery twas ever thus right there is ample record of merchants in ancient rome cheating their customers out of a libra of barley or whatever cursed you affidious fortis i want my silver quinari back measuring by weight is harder to scam as long as you have an authority or regulator who calibrates the scales and measuring by cup or you know other volumetric measures can be fiddled with in a variety of very interesting and creative ways that retailers have have honed over millennia and so in the united states the government has been i would say a little less willing to step into that kind of granular regulation whereas in europe it's there's a more of a tradition of that that cultural and constitutional resistance to top-down government regulation here in the u.s might also explain at least somewhat why we are the only major economy in the whole world that has yet to fully adopt the metric system for more about that history see my earlier video with dr mim that is linked in the description it's certainly the case that measuring by volume is much more technologically simple manufacturing a vessel of relatively uniform size is a lot easier than manufacturing even the most primitive scale cheap mass-produced scales were not widely available until the turn of the 20th century it's only around then that we start to see recipes written by weight in any country if you look at recipes from the early 19th century they'll say things like put in the amount of flour equivalent in size to you know a large egg you know like what does that mean so i wonder if maybe the sudden transition to metric that so many countries went through in the 20th century maybe that provided them with an opportunity for a reset when you're throwing out your ancient system of measurements it's not much harder to go a little bit further and throw out your ancient system of measuring things by volume and a scale is only one new piece of gear to buy as opposed to a whole new set of volume measures a scale is one thing to buy my little hypothesis is that we in the united states by resisting metrification we have denied ourselves the opportunity for that kind of society-wide reset and as a result we're still cooking with methods that were developed by pioneer ladies who were measuring out the ingredients for their cake with a tea cup because that's all the gear they had and it doesn't even matter because you have died of dysentery as we've discussed here previously americans have been quietly adopting

kitchens especially bakeries use weight and when you switch over to weight it's only natural to switch over to metric as well because the ounce is too big for cooking a single ounce is almost 30 grams and 10 or 20 grams of flour can make a real difference in a recipe ounces don't offer you a fine enough scale and yeah fractions and decimals exist but whole numbers are easier to read and so american bakers have been switching to metric for many decades now metric weights are better for cooking i wouldn't dispute that my argument here is not against metric it has nothing to do with metric my argument is in favor of measuring stuff in the kitchen with volume regardless of what units you use and here's reason number one volume is visible weight is not we feel weight with our sense of touch we cannot see weight what we see is the volume of space that the item takes up you might think you know what 200 grams of cheese looks like but you don't right what you have is an association you know from experience how much space a 200 gram block of cheese generally occupies and you're doing a volume to weight conversion in your head when you look at it you think oh that looks like about 200 grams of cheese to me this does not have to be your goal but my goal in the kitchen is to measure things as little as possible i think it's a lot quicker and easier and more fun to just eyeball stuff a little bit of this a little bit of that and i think that human beings are just much more naturally suited to judging kitchen type quantities by eye rather than by feel of weight so if you want to cook by eye i think it makes more sense to just stay in the world of volume most of the time rather than doing volume to weight conversions in your head one reason why professional kitchens like to work with weights is that the pros are dealing with huge quantities it's really really hard to intuitively tell the difference between this and this by eye whereas like it's pretty easy to tell the difference between like this and this by eye down here this is the scale of objects that evolution has calibrated our sensory apparatus to judge things in this kind of range and this is the range that we're normally dealing with in the kitchen right reason number two i like volume you gotta scoop your stuff out with something you might as well scoop it out with something that gives you a rough idea of how much you have scooped i mean i know people who cook with scales sometimes do this thing where they hold the whole flour container over the bowl and just pour it in but i think that's a pain you got to do it slowly to be careful and if you're not careful you can easily start an avalanche and then i think it's easier to scoop out flour with some kind of cup and to scoop out things like baking powder with some kind of spoon you might as well do it with a cup or a spoon which helps you judge how much you have scooped this leads me to reason number three measuring by volume minimizes dishes or at least it can help you minimize dishes to measure by weight you often have to get a whole big bowl dirty you need a bowl on the scale and that bowl is dishes neutral if you're also mixing the food in that bowl but say you're mixing your stuff in a stand mixer you can't just put that on a scale while it's in the machine sure if you need to add something in halfway through your mixing process you could take it off the machine and then put it back on the scale but i think it's easier to just leave it in the machine and simply scoop in whatever you need to add and to scoop it with a scooper that helps you keep track of how much you have added and if you're mixing your stuff in a pot you can't just take the pot off the heat and put it on your scale you're going to melt your scale what you're going to do is you're going to measure your stuff in a bowl on the scale which is going to make that bowl dirty and bowls take up more space in the dishwasher than a measuring cup or a spoon now to be sure measuring by volume can definitely create way more dirty dishes if you get out a different cup or a different spoon for every darn quantity that you're measuring so you know don't do that i try to cook with exactly one cup and one spoon that's it if i need half a cup of flour just fill the cup up halfway that's easy to do because volume is visible and if i need a quarter of a teaspoon of yeast to just fill the spoon up a quarter of the way which leads us to reason number four volume is actually much more accurate with very small quantities like a quarter of a teaspoon of dry yeast is about .75 grams kitchen scales usually don't show fractions of a gram because they're not accurate with weights so light helen rennie has a terrific video about this topic it is linked in the description normal kitchen scales are accurate enough when you're talking about tens of grams but just one or two grams just try measuring out like three grams of salt you'll see the scale suddenly jump you're telling me that last grain of salt weighed a whole two grams of course not for ingredients like flour and cheese the difference of a gram or two almost never really matters in the kitchen but for ingredients like salt or yeast or like a really strong spice a difference that small really could matter and volume is better at accurately measuring those things but don't take my word for it nobody can accuse our friend kenji of being an imprecise cook the dude loves precision and as he explains in this article that is linked in the description he uses weight to measure big quantities and volume to measure very small quantities this is one reason why spoons and dashes and pinches persist in recipes even in places where people are really accustomed to using kitchen scales look at this bbc bread recipe the flour is given in grams but the salt is given in teaspoons the only reason they give the yeast in grams is because the yeast comes pre-measured seven grams is how much these envelopes hold unless you have a scale that is designed to measure fractions of a gram scales that are often marketed as jeweler's scales regardless of what substances people actually weigh on them unless you have one of those volume is more accurate than weight for very small quantities which is not to say that volume is totally accurate either a teaspoon of salt can be a very different quantity depending on the size and shape of the grains this is why you can't just go buy the recipe you got gotta taste your food put in a little salt taste it add more salt if it needs it this leads me to my fifth and final reason measuring by volume encourages you to think for yourself i'm skating on very thin ice right now i realize that i'm speaking purely from my own anecdotal experience and i'm i'm theorizing i'm guessing from my own anecdotal experience but this is what i will tell you i know that about half of you about half of my audience are here in the united states where volume is still king in the kitchen and i also know that most times when i get a dm from somebody who's having trouble with one of my recipes usually what they're having trouble with is the quantity of flour in one of my recipes most of those people in those dms that i get express their problem to me in grams and most of their problems have to do with them following my recipe to the letter instead of doing what i said to do which is to use the recipe or the quantity in the recipe as a baseline and then add more flour until it feels right this is pretty much always the advice i offer just use the measurement as a starting point and then keep putting in flour until it looks and feels the way that it's supposed to one of the beauties of teaching cooking through a medium like video is i can show you what it looks like i think i'm guessing based upon this experience that gram recipes might encourage robotic thinking a kind of paint by numbers mentality this recipe has super precise measurements so all i gotta do is just follow it to the dot and i'm gonna have a great dinner problem is it doesn't work that way for those of us in the cups and spoons world we're maybe a little more used to measurement alone being inadequate for flour in particular a cup of flour is a really different quantity depending on whether the flour is compressed or fluffed up so because i grew up in the cups and spoons world maybe i'm just a little bit more used to using the quantities in the recipe as a baseline and then using feel and judgment to take it the rest of the way if you measure your flour by grams you're more likely to get away with just cooking by measurement and never using your own senses or judgment but there can still be problems 50 grams of flour will absorb more or less water depending on what kind of flour it is it's protein content whether it's been bleached how finely it's been milled when professional kitchens use weight they're generally working from a recipe that has been written by a chef in-house right and that chef knows exactly what kind of flour they're working with that chef knows exactly how that oven they have there behaves the test cooks at the bbc don't know about your flour or your oven or how salty you like your bread we all have to think for ourselves in our kitchens i'm hypothesizing that if you resign yourself to using a more imprecise measure like a cup to measure flour then you're more likely to use your head and your hands instead instead of just following the recipe like a drone but i realized that the argument i just made is in conflict with the argument i made for reason number four right sorry about that if you're in school right now for sociology or psychology or cognition or maybe even like technical communication i think that you could devise an experiment to test this hypothesis you give one group of cooks a recipe with really specific quantities to the gram and you give them a scale to cook it with and then you give the other group a recipe with really kind of vague quantities on it and no scale but a recipe that gives really specific verbiage about what the thing should look like and then you just see who has a better experience whose product comes out closer to the ideal model lastly as i mentioned at the top there may be a secret sixth reason why i like volume i was born into volume right i was born into the world of cups and spoons cups and spoons is who i am and i like myself i know myself i'm comfortable with myself i don't know other people i'm not comfortable with them i fear the unknown and the world of grams is the unknown it's not who i am maybe that's why i like volume there's a lot of people in this world who believe that one culture is objectively superior to another culture and maybe they're right i don't know i just know that it's kind of a remarkable coincidence that so many of these people in fact i'd say most of these people who believe that there is one objectively superior culture just happened to have been born into that culture i mean what are the odds how lucky for you all of us have a very limited understanding of why we like what we like luckily we don't really have to understand it right especially here in the kitchen where the stakes are pretty darn low make your dinner however you like it this is why i like measuring things by volume take from that what you will,3

JuneShine Hard Kombucha is ridiculously refreshing, low-sugar,...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.187352, this is how i was finally able to enjoy gnocchi by frying them in their traditional browned butter sauce until golden they get a very crispy skin on them that's satisfying to bite through very tasty historically gnocchi are italian balls of miscellaneous starch bound into dumplings with egg and or cheese the version most popular among italian americans is flour and potato and even if you do the trick where you roll the dumpling across a fork to make lots of surface area on which sauce can cling i just think they taste like fluffy nothing so here's how i do it instead i'd say one large russet type potato for two portions of gnocchi that's about a one pound or half kilo floury potato stabbed maniacally so as to release steam while cooking i think the best way to get potato for gnocchi is to make baked potatoes for dinner the previous night but throw in an extra potato while you're at it just bake them until soft and squishy like an hour if you don't have a leftover baked potato you can just throw one in the microwave it only takes about 10 minutes in there for me to get it soft the flavor is not as good but at least it's drier than a boiled potato people do boil potatoes for gnocchi but drier potato is easier to mold into dumplings and the flavor from the baked potato is superior i think this is the baked one after it's cooled a sec i just pull the flesh out with my fingers this allows me to feel around for pieces like that that's a leathery bit of flesh from right next to the skin that had dried out we won't be able to smash that up smooth so get it out i just want the fluffy bits a ricer is a great tool for mashing this up but a fork is also fine just smoosh it until it's smooth and then i'm gonna make a little koi pond in the center where i'll put my egg just the egg yolk i'm making dinner for two and a whole egg would be too much too wet plus i think they do taste a little better when you only use yolk i say a pinch of salt per portion with dumplings this big i think the interior really does need at least a little seasoning plus some cheese on the inside this is pecorino that'll contribute some salt as well i'll just break up that yolk and then flour i think the common approach with flour and gnocchi is you put in as little as necessary to make this come together into a moldable dough i started with half a cup and ended up putting in about a full cup that's like 120 grams a lot of people emphasize working this as little as possible as soon as you put in the flour they want to keep their gnocchi soft minimize gluten development but i hate fluffy gnocchi they taste like baby food give me that chew plus for the pan frying method i'm going to show you you kind of need the gnocchi to be more solid if they're too soft they'll break apart in the pan there we go smooth not too sticky but still quite soft and squishy because of the potato it's still gonna be a dumpling not just a giant hunk of pasta this is easier to roll out and shape if you let it sit and let the flower hydrate for like 15 minutes i wish i had a drink oh i do check out june shine the sponsor of this video yes i'm advertising hard kombucha in a gnocchi video won't be the first time i baffle somebody's nona kombucha naturally wants to ferment into alcohol the makers here have simply decided to not fight it and you get a product that's about six percent alcohol like beer june is a kind of kombucha june shine like moonshine get it and they make all these creative flavors look at this crazy one that color is from activated charcoal surprisingly tasty this one is citrusy june shine is gluten free unlike beer there's no artificial colors there's syrups the ingredients are 100 organic and because it's kombucha it's filled with probiotics i mean it's still an alcoholic beverage but even putting aside the health stuff it's got this beautiful complex fermented flavor june shine is in a lot of stores here in the u.s now if you want to get a box like this in the mail it works out to like two dollars a can depending on how much you buy and you can get 20 off plus free shipping with my link in the description do us both the favor thank you joonshine now after a quick rest we're good to roll this out just roll it out into a snake when the snake gets too long cut it in half and keep rolling then the only trick to cutting these out into little pillows is to kick them away with the knife cut and kick cut and kick it's a dance craze the cut sides are extremely sticky and if two dumplings touch you'll never get them apart sounds like a parable roll out the other half and repeat this might not look like enough gnocchi for two people but this is a very heavy dinner especially with the browned butter no part of me wants to eat more than half of this and i'm not going to do the fork trick to give these pretty little ridges that would actually reduce the amount of browned surface that i could get on each dumpling i really don't care about the shape of these at all i just want bite-sized lumps of dough who cares if they're not all the same dimensions as long as they're all about the same size into a little pot of boiling water these go i do find i have to plop them in almost one at a time or else they'll stick to each other just give them a quick stir to make sure they're not sticking to the bottom and then i'll immediately throw a huge knob of butter into my non-stick pan and turn the heat on medium get it melting because these only take like two minutes to cook when they all float they're cooked enough especially because we're going to cook them a lot more in the pan i'll just drain those as dry as possible through the pot lid dry because we won't be able to brown them in here until we boil out the remaining water anyway you can do this in another kind of pan as long as you keep them moving constantly to keep them from sticking but the teflon makes it so much easier and you don't lose any crust to the bottom of the pan i've seen lots of cooks let their gnocchi brown a little in the butter i'm just taking it to the extreme when i've gotten some good color on these i'll throw in my sage totally traditional to do gnocchi and brown butter and sage i like to tear in whole leaves they fry beautifully crisp in the butter but sage is very strong don't do this unless you're sure you like sage i love it i need some more butter in there things are looking too dry once the sage leaves are crispy these are done i might give one a taste just to check for seasoning i'll toss a little more salt in there but once i get this on the plate i'm gonna cover it in grated pecorino which is very salty too i don't want the dumplings salty enough on their own if they were they'd be too salty those sage leaves are not just for garnish you gotta try eating them whole they have this delicious crumpling crispy pastry texture in the mouth now i'm not saying my gnocchi are objectively better than your nonas i'm just saying that we can all enjoy our own dinners more if we give ourselves permission to be honest with ourselves about what we like and deviate from tradition accordingly speaking of which i've had this weird idea that orange zest would be good in this orange and sage are often paired together with turkey and duck and such and yeah that is a phenomenal combination experimentation,3

...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.187352, the secret to getting a glossy papery skin on your brownies is to get the sugar very well dissolved and or dispersed through your batter if you can see or feel lots of really big sandy grains of sugar in your batter you're probably not gonna get that skin if you really dissolve your sugar and you're still not getting that nice glossy skin then i would guess that maybe you don't have enough sugar or maybe you have too much water or you don't have the right kind of sugar it has to be sucrose or perhaps some similar sugars but most of the common syrups in the kitchen will not do it honey brownies yum contrary to what a lot of very smart people believe brownie skin does not result from using a specific kind of fat and it does not result from whipping air into the batter it is chiefly about the sugar and secondarily the water we're going to prove it with experiments and the experiments will also explain why other people are wrong about this because in a way they're not wrong whipping the eggs and the sugar a lot can help you get brownie skin using lots of solid chocolate in your batter can help you get brownie skin as is so often the case in cooking people's methods work it's simply their reasoning or their explanation of the method that is false and they're not wrong because they're stupid they're wrong because they have important things to do in their lives they can't blow a whole week doing 50 test bakes to isolate the variables and figure out which one is causal only a lunatic like me does that so let's go to start we're going to need a baseline brownie recipe right mark bittman here has the basic no frills and somewhat old-fashioned version of nearly every dish in the western culinary canon here we'll bake this four ounces of unsweetened chocolate and a stick of butter melt in a pan or in the microwave in goes a cup of sugar and two eggs let's see what else a splash of vanilla and a pinch of salt and finally a half a cup of flour mix it smooth bake it and it looks like this no skin boo now let's try that same exact bitman recipe again but this time we'll swap out the granulated sugar for this powdered sugar or icing sugar as the brits would say simply an extremely fine grain of sugar and it's fluffier more aerated so you gotta use like one and three quarter cups to get the same weight as a single cup of normal sugar mix that up and note how much more viscous the batter is bake that and beautiful papery skin look at the difference but i have questions powdered sugar isn't just sugar there's also a small amount of corn starch in there it serves as an anti-caking agent could the cornstarch be helping the crust maybe absorbing water helping the skin dry well let's see if we can make our own powdered sugar without cornstarch in it i blitzed this for literally a half hour and it's nowhere near as fine as powdered sugar but it is finer so let's make the bitman recipe with it same quantity of sugar by weight and that's not the best skin i've ever gotten on brownies but that batch does have some skin now let's use the food processor sugar again but this time add seven grams of corn starch if you look at the nutritional label you can see that it has 29 grams of sugar but 30 grams of carbohydrates so we know that that remaining gram can only be cornstarch it's 1 30 corn starch anyway identical to the previous batch with no corn starch corn starch is not why powdered sugar gives us great skin i used to think it was but the real reason is any super fine grain of sugar is going to dissolve really easily into the batter and how do we know that's the real reason well let's talk to dr pia sorensen at harvard co-author of the new book science and cooking physics meets food from homemade to oat cuisine the sort of magic power of sugar is that you can dissolve a lot of sugar in water you can actually dissolve twice the amount by weight of sugar in any amount of water so doc suggests we try making the bitman recipe as written with normal granulated sugar and i'm just barely bringing this together i'm certainly not whipping in air the only thing we'll do differently this time is just let it sit for a long time in fact i just mixed it up and then i went to bed when you mix all the things together the sugar is going to dissolve in the water in the batter and even if you're not actually adding water right you're sort of indirectly adding water because there's water in the egg there's even some amount of water in the flour right there's like 15 water in the flour and that little bit of water in these ingredients is enough to dissolve the sugar now you might normally accelerate the dissolution process with a little bit of heat or maybe with agitation stirring it really aggressively but we want to isolate the variables here heat could cause other chemical changes in the batter and whipping it could get a lot of air into the batter so that's why we're just mixing it up and just letting it sit still for a long time the next morning you can see how much more viscous it is dissolved sugar makes liquids thicker bake it and it's a little lumpin but that is shiny brownie skin again here's that same recipe mixed up and immediately baked here it is mixed up allowed to sit overnight and then baked when the sugar is well dissolved you get skin it's almost that simple but why right why does dissolving the sugar get us the skin so what i think happens is that here is this batter right sitting in a pan it has a little viscosity then you heat it and any air that is trapped in the batter is going to try to escape but already at the very surface you have already kind of dehydrated that a little bit so it's already forming a little bit of a shell that is trapping the air that is coming up from inside the guts of the brownie and then there's this delicate balance where you want this very top layer to be dehydrated enough and viscous enough so that it both can lift a little bit but also not break and just sort of go poof right away indeed the latter scenario is exactly what we see happening in our batches that don't have skin they are pock marked with little popped bubbles here's a batch that for reasons we'll soon discuss has some areas with skin and some areas without skin look under the microscope these skinless areas are just full of little holes where the surface layer could not hold back the gas the gas pushed through and left a little hole if we look at the areas that do have skin we can see the surface here has dried in the oven to a hard shell gases pushed up under it stretching it taut and smooth like a balloon but the balloon never popped it stayed solid it stayed smooth and smooth things reflect light much more directly that's what gloss is and what goes better with a glossy brownie let's thank the sponsor of this video trade coffee in the space of a year trade has turned me from a coffee noob into a total nerd now when i fill out their online quiz i know exactly what kind of coffee i like and they send me more of it all kinds of fun things from the top roasters coffees i never find on my own having

to my door at regular intervals their packaging is compostable by the way you can do us both a favor and save fifty percent on your first bag when you sign up with my link and code in the description if you don't love it they'll send you a different bag for free that fifty percent offer is good for the first hundred of you who use my link and my code rogucia50 shipping is also free thank you trade now let me show you a batch that i made with powdered sugar so that the sugar would dissolve really thoroughly and i increased the sugar quantity by about a third the surface area dried so hard and candy-like that the skin couldn't even balloon very much with the gas it just sat there a solid impenetrable wall in contrast here's a batch that i made with the bitman recipe with powdered sugar which normally gives you great skin but instead of increasing the sugar content i increased the water content just like a quarter cup of water there and look even though that sugar is very well dissolved no skin the batter was too loose and wet the surface didn't dry in time to hold the gases back we get a field of popped bubbles instead so if you've got a brownie recipe that you really like but it doesn't give you that nice skin the first thing that i would try is just swapping out the sugar for powdered sugar if that doesn't work try increasing the sugar a little bit and or decreasing the water a little bit and if your recipe doesn't call directly for water try removing one of the egg whites you need the emulsifiers in the yolk but the protein in the white is less important and it's mostly water so you can just cut it out you could also get rid of the water that's in the butter butter is 15 or 20 percent water and you can get it out by switching it with clarified butter which has no water in it or you could brown the butter brown butter tastes great in brownies and in the course of browning it you're gonna evaporate most of its water or you could swap the butter for oil no water and oil right this batch i made with powdered sugar and oil instead of butter inferior flavor but even better skin this experiment also suggests that the type of fat is irrelevant to skin it's merely a matter of the water that the butter brings with it so why do so many people say that cocoa butter is the key to brownie skin melting lots of solid chocolate into your batter that gives you the skin lots of people claim that i suppose one reason could be that cocoa butter is a form of fat that brings little if any water with it so if you swap out the butter in your recipe for cocoa butter you can have less water in the batter and as a result that surface of the batter will be able to dry faster in the oven it could also be that that extra step of heating and melting the chocolate helps to dissolve your sugar heat accelerates dissolution and if you put the sugar in the pan with your chocolate and your butter and such as you're melting all of it that's going to help dissolve the sugar plus if you're melting sweetened chocolate like chocolate chips then it could be the sugar that's already in the chocolate helping you out and that sugar is already dissolved so you don't have to you're not you're not running into this problem with the sugar not dissolving and that is then um again causing that crust likewise this is probably why people think whipping air into the batter will give you skin it does but not because you've aerated the batter it's because this extra step of beating the sugar and the eggs until foamy also agitates the sugar in the presence of water helping it to dissolve more smoothly though the crust you get from that technique is not as shiny i would guess that's because the very small bubbles that you beat into the batter make the surface less smooth but it's still good and dry so it's crusty because the sugar was well dissolved into a minimal amount of water all of this raises the question why not just make brownies with a form of sugar that's already dissolved aka a syrup well here's the bittman recipe again with no sugar but an equivalent amount of corn syrup by weight no skin at all on those here's the same experiment but with honey instead of sugar no skin at all why not well maybe we have too much water in the batter honey and corn syrup are both like 20 water and we know from our other experiments that having too much water in the batter means that the surface layer won't be able to dry in time to form a crust so let's try boiling the water out of the honey mix up the batter bake it and yikes well maybe something different is happening on the molecular level here honey and corn syrup are mostly glucose and fructose and other sugars that are not sucrose cane sugar is sucrose so let's try making a pure sucrose syrup you need a little bit of water to get it dissolving but then i boiled it to about 240 fahrenheit which according to candy making references should mean that most of the water is gone mix up the batter bake the brownies and no skin dry batter fully dissolved sucrose no skin why not sucrose it's essentially two rings linked together it's one glucose ring and one fructose ring and they're held together by one single bond and that's it and that bond is easily broken with acid or with heat a little heat in a not particularly acidic solution won't do much at least if you don't leave it in there for very long but the kind of heat necessary to create a low moisture sugar syrup what that does when you then heat it is it pretty quickly breaks that bond and then you get what's called invert sugar which is really just a solution of fructose and glucose that's it and as we've previously established those sugars don't make brownie skin one more experiment here's the bittman recipe with powdered sugar which would normally give us a great skin but i'm going to drop in just a little glug of honey just a little spoonful and that is this batch the brownies with some skin and some not skin even a small amount of sugar that isn't sucrose disrupts that skin formation why well this is just an educated guess now but dr sorensen suspects that what's happening is when the sucrose dries on the surface of the brownie it recrystallizes a little bit and that's at least part of why the resulting skin is so smooth and shiny and crispy you can imagine that there are all these molecules kind of floating around a solution and in order for a crystal to form it's a little bit like um almost like building a brick wall where all of the bricks sort of fit together perfectly now imagine if instead of a solution with molecules where they're all the same size imagine instead you have some of those but then you also have maybe even just a few of some other molecules that are not quite like a half brick but they're sort of just a slightly different maybe they're a little round and now you want to build that brick wall and have it kind of stick together you can imagine that it's not going to fit perfectly there's going to be little little crevices and a little air here and there and it's not going to stick together as nicely so you're not going to be forming those little crystals again because those smaller different ones are interrupting the crystal structure so i think that is what the honey does that's what corn syrup does i buy it there's only one hitch though in my previous recipe video linked in the description i showed you the original brownie recipe that i came up with in the course of doing all these experiments it's got great skin and i used powdered sugar in it but i also used sweetened condensed milk why doesn't that disrupt the crystal structure well condensed or evaporated milk is conventionally made in a vacuum pan you boil it in a low atmospheric pressure environment and that lowers the boiling point so you can drive off the moisture at a much lower temperature that isn't going to really affect the flavor of the milk so much the fact that my recipe got me skinned suggests that the manufacturer of this specific brand at least uses real cane sugar or some other kind of sucrose and that they dissolve it into the milk either in the vacuum pan or later at some relatively low temperature in either case a temperature low enough to not break the intramolecular bond of the sucrose and of course the sugar in milk is lactose which is also a two-ringed it's not a one ring they're different to ring structures than sucrose but still it may be less disruptive right than than having all these wandering structures in there however it occurs to me that some cheaper manufacturers of sweetened condensed milk might boil their product at a higher temperature to save time or they might use corn syrup instead of the more expensive cane sugar in either case that would disrupt your skin so if you're using my recipe and not getting skin maybe try a different brand of sweetened condensed milk lastly there's the issue of the molasses in my recipe i wanted that nice flavor you get from brown sugar but i wanted the crust you get from powdered sugar so i used powdered sugar and i called for just like a couple of teaspoons of molasses because after all brown sugar is just sugar with molasses in it molasses itself is a byproduct of sugar making and as a result it has a lot of sucrose in it but depending on what brand you buy and how it was processed it might have lots of other sugars in it as well so if you're doing my recipe and not getting good skin this may be a reason why and or maybe you're using too much here's two batches of my recipe this one has about half as much molasses as this one and this one is shinier maybe that's the reason why and of course if you just want brownies with great skin but you don't have to worry about any of these variables just buy boxed brownie mix the mixes usually give you great skin because their water to sugar ratio is carefully formulated and because the sugar is very fine look how powdery that mix is tiny sugar crystals that'll dissolve even better than coffee into water don't forget to save 50 on your first bag from trade with my link and code in the description and happy skin hunting because that doesn't sound terrifying,3

What is brownie skin? Brownie skin investigation part I: https://youtu...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.187352, by combining a few less conventional techniques and ingredients we can get very chewy brownies with a glossy papery top plus a strong milky almost marshmallowy flavor from the key ingredient sweetened condensed milk get the oven heating to 325 fahrenheit 160c convection if you've got it i'm using a 9 inch square pan 23 centimeters you could go a little smaller and these are very sticky brownies so i recommend a parchment paper sling to get them out it'll sit flatter in the pan if you just snip each corner diagonally a little bit they're good enough the weight of the batter will hold it down a little pot on the stove and then goes a whole stick of butter half a cup 113 grams and turn the heat on medium i'm not a member of the browned butter cult it's not one of my favorite flavors but it works exceptionally well with the condensed milk here first you melt it then you boil out the water butter is 15 or 20 water boiling it out will allow us to brown the milk solids in here oh a tiny whisk is extremely useful for this recipe when the bubbling changes to fizzing and popping and foaming you want to make sure that you're stirring if you don't the milk solids will sink to the bottom of the pan and stick and then they won't be in our batter we want them when the butter smells kind of like caramel and you can see it just turning brown in goes half a cup of cocoa powder 50 grams i'm using dutch cocoa that's the dark kind that's in oreos but you could use any cocoa powder you want and when it's whisked in smooth let it boil in there for a minute this step intensifies the flavor of the cocoa a bit i can smell it toasting a little now and i don't want it to burn so off the heat this comes we're done with the heat time to whisk in an entire 14 ounce can of sweetened condensed milk about 400 grams make sure you get the sweetened kind the syrup in here makes these brownies very moist and chewy and there goes the lid whoops next one cup 120 grams of powdered sugar gotta be powdered sugar if you want that papery skin on this particular recipe you will still see some little particles that won't dissolve those are the browned butter solids those aren't a problem a big lug of vanilla a couple of teaspoons pinch of salt only if you used unsalted butter and then this is optional but a little glug of molasses makes the flavor more complex far too sticky to measure out a teaspoon or two i just drip a little out of the bottle that gets you the flavor of brown sugar because brown sugar is just sugar plus molasses then one solitary egg yolk the sugar and everything has lowered the temperature in here plenty so it's not going to scramble no egg white at all that would make these brownies more cakey and i've not tried it but i bet a spoon of instant espresso powder would be a nice flavor in here as well once everything is smooth it's time for flour just three quarters of a cup 160 grams all-purpose flour whisk that in smooth plus any nuts if you want those if you want solid chocolate chips set the pan aside and let it cool a bit before you stir them in or they will just melt instantly into the batter no good chilling those chips in the freezer helps to prevent that and i'll do a cup at most a wooden spoon is now pretty much the only thing strong enough to handle a batter rich and sticky as honey which is the sponsor of this video let's thank them honey is a free browser extension that helps you to save money whenever you're shopping online whether it's tech and

description it takes two clicks to install joinhoney.com thank you honey scrape that honey bowl clean you know i bet peanut butter chips would be great with the milky flavor of these brownies i would not try to smooth this out with a spoon you might never get it back you can try thumping the pan to get it even but just don't worry about it it'll melt to an even layer in the oven this takes up to 40 minutes for me in there but every pan in every oven is different seriously different pan materials will cook brownies way faster than others look within five minutes you can see the skin forming the convection fan helps with that but that's also why we need the heat a little lower at 350 fahrenheit i find it starts burning after 20 minutes the toothpick or skewer test shows us we're nowhere close super gooey you can do that test with a knife by the way here we are after about 30 minutes and if you like your brownies really fudgy pull them at this stage when the skewer still comes out a little muddy if you like them chewier keep baking this is 35 minutes not totally clean those will be a hair fudgy i'm pulling them and they're molten now so you got to let them cool for at least a little bit this is an hour later and you can just lift them out with the paper beautiful crackly skin on those i have been investigating the science of that skin and how exactly you can make sure that your brownies will have it i believe that i've cracked the code not just for this crazy recipe but for any brownie recipe i will reveal that code on monday if you're watching this in the distant future it'll be linked in the description those are chewier than any scratch-made brownie i've ever had with a really cool caramelized milk flavor and here's a batch without any chocolate chips in them i think i prefer those the more they sit around after you've baked them the more candy like that top gets you see that one that is the thick and cakey version of this recipe same basic deal you just use the whole egg a full cup of flour and a teaspoon of baking powder both recipes are in the description i'm honestly really excited about this one it took me a lot of versions but these are my first home baked brownies that i think beat the boxed ones let me know if it works as well for you,3
What is that glossy skin on brownies?,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5rY7IWLshAI/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLD1tgQ87sMWR7wNnnNa_116NjEiVg,5rY7IWLshAI,"15 minutes, 40 seconds","Thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this video!

You
know that thin, glossy layer that's on the surface of some brownies, particularly the
ones you bake from a box? What is that shiny skin? And how do you make sure that your brownie
recipe will have it? You and me — we're going to answer both of those questions definitively,
though today we're just focusing on the first one. What exactly is the skin? Yes, Ragusea
is doing a two-parter on brownie skin. Buckle up. This is Dr. Pia Sörensen, co-author of
the new book ""Science and Cooking: Physics Meets Food, From Homemade to Haute Cuisine.""
She holds a PhD in chemical biology from Harvard, where she teaches a science of cooking class.
Yes, I called Harvard about brownie skin. ""I love that skin as well, so I think it's
a great question to ask. What I think it might be is that, on top, you have a little bit
of a foamy layer, that is basically air bubbles that are suspended in liquid batter. And that
liquid consist of some egg. And it also probably consists of some sugar, which is dissolved
in the liquid. And so what I'm guessing is, up there is some foam air, some egg, some
sugar, and maybe a little bit less of the flour and the starch."" Dr. Sörensen suspects that some of the flour,
the starch particles, are maybe sinking to the bottom of the batter in the oven, and
what's left on top is basically a dome of meringue — sweetened egg foam. This is what
I would call one of the three dominant brownie skin hypotheses that you will find on the
internet. Most people writing about it call it a crust, and I admit that crust is more
appetizing. But when I put the microscope camera on it, you can see how thin it is.
I think skin is more apt. Anyway, the three dominant hypothesis. Number one, the cocoa
butter hypothesis — people who say you get a shiny crust if you use lots of solid chocolate
containing cocoa fat in your batter. There is the sugar dissolution hypothesis
— people who say it's all about whether you sugar is fully dissolved into the aqueous
phase of the batter. And then there's the meringue hypothesis.
Lots of people say the trick to getting that skin is to beat the batter really thoroughly,
or even to beat the eggs and sugar alone to create an egg foam. And maybe that does work, or can work. But
it doesn't answer the question we're trying to answer today, which is: What is the skin?
Just because mixing the batter thoroughly might help to get the skin doesn't necessarily
mean that skin is meringue. Now the scientific powers that be think they have more important
things to dedicate their awesome laboratory capacity to then investigating brownie skin
composition. Whatever. Dr. Sörensen is going to help us figure this out for ourselves. ""If you were to then take some of that crust,
dissolve it in water, and then think of a way to measure the sugar concentration — is
the sugar concentration higher than it is in the rest of the batter? That would prove
if the sugar is there."" So, we're going to need some samples to analyze.
This right here is my favorite brownie mix from a box. Like most box mixes it gets you
great skin. And the first reason I'm skeptical of the cocoa butter hypothesis is there's
no cocoa fat in here. It's just dry cocoa powder. The fats are from the egg yolk and
the vegetable oil that you mix into the water. And then there's a little bit of soybean oil
already in the box mix. One reason that baked-from-a-box stuff comes out a little bit different is
that the processors use kind of fancy technology to individually coat all of the particles
of flour and such in fat. You can see that by grabbing the mix and squeezing it. See
how it holds its shape? Flour doesn't do that normally. That's because each particle here
is a little bit greasy. Coating the flour in fat helps it to emulsify,
or mix better into the batter, and it allows the finished brownie or cake or whatever to
hold a little bit more oil and water in itself. For more about that, see my video about box
cake mixes linked in the description. Anyway, I baked two batches of this box mix, and then
it was time to harvest the skin. This was easily one of the craziest things I've done
in my entire life. It took hours. The problem is that most of the skin is stuck to the brownie
underneath. We'll call it the brownie guts. You can tell that when the brownie bakes,
the skin forms pretty quickly, and then it puffs up like a balloon, separating from the
guts and then floating atop a layer of steam or other gas. As it settles back down, most
of it re-adheres to the guts. Only a few patches like this remain — wrinkles where the balloon
did not settle smoothly. Those are really the only places where you
can harvest pure skin. See a little bit like that? That's got some guts stuck to the bottom,
so it's no good as a sample, and the skin is far too delicate to scrape clean. It is
gossamer thin, which means there simply isn't much of it, in terms of mass. I quickly realized
I was going to need to bake more boxes — six in all. Why? Well, when you're doing chemistry
at home, you're using relatively crude equipment and methods, and it's hard to accurately measure
out very, very small quantities. Like, if you accidentally measure out 0.03 grams of
something, instead of 0.02 grams of it, you will have just inflated your results by 50%.
So to get more accurate results, you've got to work at a pretty big physical scale. I
needed lots of skin. It's kind of like getting a sufficient sample size in statistics. Like, if I were to drop dead right now and
I was the only case in your sample size of one, your data would indicate that the fatality
rate of making videos about brownie skin is a 100%. It's a death sentence! Don't do it!
The bigger the sample size, the more you neutralize the influence of random chance. So again,
MOAR SKIN. From six boxes, I harvested a whopping six grams of pure, unadulterated, fair trade
brownie skin — street value undetermined. Now we're also going to need a sample of the
brownie guts to compare with. I thought the solid chocolate chips inside might be a confounding
variable, so I picked them out. Those guts are so wet, so we're going to need to dry
them before we can analyze them. A way they dry soil samples and such in a laboratory
is in basically a very low convection oven, like 60C, 140 Fahrenheit. 170 is the best
I can do in my oven. You want a temperature that will drive off
the water without causing any other chemical changes in the sample. Now that it's dried
a bit, I'm going to spin it in my coffee grinder, which I have, of course, cleaned thoroughly.
Smaller the particle size means more surface area for evaporation and we can get it even
dryer. I'm going to dry both the guts and the skin samples overnight. The skin is obviously
much drier to start with, and we need to equalize the water content to analyze them. We don't
really have a good way of accurately measuring the water content of the samples, so in order
to get them both to the same water content, what we need to do is get it to zero, right?
Or as close to zero as possible — totally dry it out. Here they are the next day, and
it's time to pulverize them some more. We're going to dissolve these into solutions and
they'll dissolve much quicker and more evenly if they're blasted into powders. Nobody sneeze!
Now to figure out what's in there chemically, we're going to need some tools. ""So there are various sort of home test ways
to test sugar concentrations. One of them is to use like a glucose meter that diabetics
use. You would have to probably do a series of dilutions to get to a concentration that
they would pick up on, I think — I'm not sure."" Problem with that is, those are generally
made to measure glucose specifically, and there's other kinds of simple sugars in baked
goods, notably sucrose — table sugar. So another option would be this. This is a brix
Refractometer, specifically one that is made for home brewers and wine makers. I got it
for 18 bucks on Amazon. Brix is a unit of measurement. Strictly speaking, one degree
of brix is one gram of sucrose dissolved into a 100 grams of water, though this will spot
other sugars as well — simple carbohydrates, as opposed to more complex carbohydrates,
starches. Home brewers use these to see how much of their grains have been broken down
into sugars, and then in turn, how much of the sugar has been metabolized by yeast into
alcohol. And as such, these are designed to read sugar concentrations that are within
the range that you would typically encounter in that pursuit, namely zero to 30 brix. So we're going to have to make sure that our
solution is diluted down into that range. I'm using a straw to very delicately shovel
my desiccated brownie guts powder into a little beaker, and I'm measuring out two grams. Normal
kitchen scales, by the way, in my experience often struggle to accurately measure differences
of just one or two grams, and they might not even try to measure differences of a fraction
of a gram. So for that you're going to need something else. There are cheap ones that
you can buy like this one — they're often made for measuring jewelry. In this case,
it's just aimed at, like, dieters. So it's for portioning out very, very small differences
of food. I got it at Walmart for 20 bucks. And I'm using a pipette that came with my
refractometer to measure out four grams of water — distilled water from the grocery
store, just to be safe. Now, even if my brownie was a 100% sugar,
I can be assured that it will be down to the zero to 30 range that this thing is built
to detect. I'll stir that up with a clean skewer – they use a glass stirring rod for
this in a lab. Then I'll deposit a few drops onto the refractometer. You lay over what
is called the daylight plate. It presses the sample flat, and then you hold it up to light
and you look inside. The device uses a prism to detect the degree to which the sample changes
the direction, or refracts, light. What you see inside the eye piece is just a simple
meter. It looks like this. Based on the refraction, it can tell how much sugar is in the solution. Brownie guts sample number one reads 20 brix
at two-to-one dilution. Since very subtle mistakes in measurement could throw off a
number like that, what we've got to do is repeat the experiment. I did several more
readings with that sample, and then I mixed up another sample, Guts 2 — virtually the
same result. If we're testing the meringue hypothesis, another thing we might want to
know is protein content, right? Meringues are stabilized with egg proteins. So is there
a way to measure protein at home? ""What about these sticks? You know, I don't
know if you know anyone on the keto diet. Sticks like that that would basically measure
protein in urine."" 22 bucks on Amazon — a urine protein refractometer.
To get our brownie sample into the range this is designed to detect, we have to dilute it
way more — four grams of water to one gram brownie guts, and 7.5 grams of protein per
100 milliliters of liquid is the unit this thing shows us. A similar reading when I mixed
a second solution. So, that's good. But while those numbers might be proportionally right
relative to each other, Dr. Sörensen cautions that they might not be right, because refractometers
are built to measure certain specific liquids. In this case, urine — not brownie dissolved
in water. We don't need a scientist to tell us that light passes differently through urine
than it does through brownie guts. Indeed, I also bought a salinity refractometer and
it showed all of my brownie samples as being off-the-scale salty, which can't possibly
be right. This is aimed at people keeping fish tanks,
and that's just a very different kind of liquid that it's built to analyze. So the protein
and sugar numbers might not be right, but we can be reasonably assured they'll be wrong
to exactly the same degree with our other sample — the brownie skin sample. We don't
need to know the precise sugar and protein content here. We're not calculating nutritional
data, thank god. All we need to know is whether the protein and sugar is higher in the skin
than it is in the guts. And across repeated tests with multiple dilutions of the skin,
we see that the sugar and protein content of the skin does seem to be a little bit higher.
But such a minor difference could easily be explained by simple measurement error. I'm
doing science with a bendy straw — this isn't exactly CSI: Special Pastries Unit. It could also be that I failed to get my brownie
guts all the way dry. After all, it did start off much wetter than the skin. And if there's
any water content at all in one of the samples, then any solution made with that sample is
going to be that much less concentrated, right? So I dried both of my samples overnight again.
I tested them again this morning, and indeed I got virtually identical results between
the guts and the skin. These results are hardly fit for publication in a scholarly journal,
but I and Dr. Sörensen are convinced — reasonably convinced — that brownie skin and brownie
guts are simply different states of the same matter. The skin is not something that's separating
out of the batter solution and rising to the top. If the flour, the starch, was settling
to the bottom of the batter a little bit, we would expect to see the other major constituents
of the batter over-represented proportionally in the skin, and they're just not. The skin is no more meringue than the rest
of the brownie is. It looks to be all the same stuff. So, why does it look so different?
Why is it shiny? Well, probably because it's smooth. If we turn the brownie around and
we look at the underside where it was smoothed out against the pan surface, it's pretty shiny
there too. This is literally what gloss means in optics. When something is very, very smooth,
light will reflect off of it very directly. If it's rough, light will get in there and
bounce around in a million different directions. What seems to be happening here is gas is
building inside the batter as it bakes, stretching the surface into a taut, smooth membrane,
like a balloon. With this batter, you can see it happen after like five minutes. ""That makes me think that that's enough time
to have a little bit of water evaporate right on the surface so that it's no longer like
a super thin liquid. It's a little bit more viscous. And that is sort of enough for it
to be cohesive..."" ...to contain the steam or other gas underneath
it. If it was too loose, it just wouldn't be able to hold the bubble at all. And if
it was too hard, it wouldn't be able to expand. It wouldn't be pliable. It would just break
and pop. ""And I think for that to happen you have to
have some evaporation, but you also need to have the right composition of whatever egg
and sugar. And the sugar is going to contribute to viscosity. And the egg is sort of going
to capture it, right? That's going to congeal and denature as you heat it. So it seems like
there is some balance between that."" And what combination of ingredients gets you

***RECIPE***...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.187352, i have done many experiments and concluded that you can make a totally convincing homemade demi-gloss by simply combining these store-bought ingredients in these proportions and then just boiling them for a while that's it i swear it works and having a bag of demi-glass ice cubes in the house will turn your meat dishes into treasures for which you will weep when absent and i'm not calling this faux demi gloss or airsoft's demi-glass i'm calling it demi-glass we're just taking a very different route to that destination let's quickly recap what demigloss is no less in authority than anthony bourdain writes classically demigloss was a reduction of equal parts reduced veal stock and sauce espanol no one makes sauce espanola anymore what most restaurants refer to as demi is simply a strong dark highly reduced veal stock that has been strained and reduced again with red wine and shallots and even that last thing bourdain said would be debated by some chefs the core idea is it's a dark meat stock made with roasted bones and joints traditionally veal bones but this is chef john's much less expensive cheats that combines chicken wings and beef shanks anyway you simmer that stuff for literally a day strain it out then you gotta skim off the fat reduce the stock until it's within striking distance of this gloss or glaze meat glaze demi-glass is halfway to being glossed demi means half anyway to make this much more efficiently out of modern widely available industrial food products the first thing we need is pre-packaged broth or stock the standard one quart carton is the core unit of my recipe here a quart is just shy of a liter for each carton we'll need about one teaspoon of tomato paste so into my big pot i'm just squeezing out six approximate teaspoons for the six quarts of stock i'm going to boil down then i'm turning the heat on medium there's no fat in the pan i don't have to skim fat off this at the end i'm just going to mash that around and very gently brown the tomato paste what this step replicates is the common technique where chefs coat the veal bones in tomato paste before roasting them it gives you some nice caramelized sugar some brick red color and a lot of umami but i found that if i let this burn in the slightest it ruins the whole batch so i'm very conservative as soon as the paste stuck to the pan just starts to brown i can see it i can smell it that's good enough deglaze with the first carton make sure the bottom of the pan is clean and nothing is going to burn then in goes five more quarts use veal stock if you can find it i think chicken is fine for this and while broth is technically made of meat and stock is technically made from bones i don't think it really matters which you have for our purposes here and i'm not sure there's much of a difference with the prepackaged stuff what's imperative is that whatever you buy is low sodium the lowest salt content you can find or it'll be inevitably salty by the time you reduce it and quality matters i tried a lot of brands before i landed on this one it has hardly any salt and great flavor i tried mixing some beef broth in with the chicken to better approximate veal and it just didn't work most beef broth on the market in my world is somewhat artificially flavored and really gave the demi-gloss a canned soup taste better to use a high quality very low salt broth from the wrong animal the next thing believe it or not will be soy sauce a very small amount just a teaspoon per quart of broth low sodium soy sauce is best for this if you got it but i don't think it's worth making a special purchase trust me this will not taste like east asian food at the end this tiny amount of soy sauce will just supply a lot of the same flavor compounds we would get by roasting the bones for the stock you usually roast some onions with the bones so i'm putting in half a teaspoon of onion powder per quart of stock you could skip that honestly most pre-packaged broth products have some onion in them anyway what you cannot skip is this gelatin this is what you would dissolve out of the connective tissues of the veal bones it's why joints are especially good for demi-gloss lots of collagen in joints that break down into gelatin one standard quarter ounce packet of unflavored unsweetened gelatin per quart of broth those packets are seven grams each be aware that a lot of refined gelatin like this on the market is made from pig parts if you don't eat pig look for halal or kosher gelatin and you generally scatter this stuff on to keep it from clumping up we're putting in so much that it's going to clump no matter what but it doesn't matter the clumps just dissolve in time which is why i add this at the beginning of the process now literally all we got to do is boil this on high heat until it's about 1 6 of its original volume so all six of those boxes are going to be reduced to the volume of just one i'm going to pinch my spoon at the original liquid level then imagine cutting that length in half then imagine cutting the half into thirds and there when the liquid comes up to about there on the spoon we'll have one-sixth of the original volume as it reduces you might notice some good stuff sticking to the walls i try to scrape that off and get it dissolved again and scrape the bottom to make sure that nothing is sticking and burning but mostly i just left this boil largely unattended it'll take a couple hours plenty of time to prepare the new pan that i'm going to use in this video which is sponsored by misen and this is the new carbon steel pan from misen high carbon steel is basically a middle ground between stainless and cast iron you season it like cast iron to make a natural non-stick surface easy instructions there first step is to melt off the packing wax then just rub on the seasoning wax that misen kindly provides and in it goes to season miesen is a company that's making very solid basic essential cookware at shockingly low prices pans this cheap from other companies are never this beefy this thing is so solid it'll last a lifetime and it's heavy but not as heavy as cast iron which is one of the virtues of carbon steel it also heats faster and more evenly remove the handle there so you can easily transfer this to the oven a phenomenal all-purpose pan do us both a favor go to misen.com regucia carbon steel for 20 off your first order on this pan or anything misen dot com slash ragusia carbon steel for 20 off your first order thank you miezen here's our stock after an hour reduced halfway if you couldn't fit in all your cartons in the beginning just wait until the first few reduce a bit and then put in the rest here we are after two hours and yep that's about one-sixth of our original volume and this is done you could keep reducing it down to a thick glaze but it would be untenably sticky it's just easier to package and dose out this stuff if it's still got some water in it these are just standard ice cube trays i'm using i'd say each cube of these will enrich enough pan sauce for one person freeze those solid unpack into freezer bags and you're locked and loaded anytime you're making any kind of meat sauce or stew you just drop in a couple cubes and let them reduce from demigloss to gloss let me taste that and make a mental note that's just our prepackaged ingredients reduced nothing else now here's a couple of cubes of the demi-glace i made a while back closer to the traditional way with fresh animal parts that i bought from the store reduce that to a glaze and taste the texture of the two is identical because gelatin is gelatin regardless of what you boiled it out of the flavor is almost identical and very good in either case that touch of soy sauce over here really does replicate that taste of roasted bones now let's actually do something with it i've got a hanger steak here from rocking chair ranch in monroe county georgia i've got a video about how to trim and portion this it's in the description a couple little pseudo loins of hanger go into the pan they're coated in oil salt and pepper a good sear all around and then in goes butter and i'll just baste these on medium low heat until pink inside maybe 125 fahrenheit on a thermometer 50c out they go to rest on the board i'll deglaze with just a little red wine i don't bother putting wine or shallots or anything in my demi-glace because i want to keep my demi-glass versatile it's really easy for me to add flavorings to it later and in goes three cubes of my new demi-glass time now to just reduce this until thick look at how syrupy that is that's mostly the gelatin heat off bubbling stopped and i like to finish with just a little cold butter to make an emulsion some fresh thyme in there as well and that is done slice up my hanger steak on the plate and yeah that sauce is just insane the demi gloss gives it an instant hit of intense meaty flavor and more importantly that indescribably luscious texture you only get from gelatin all of this makes me wonder what if we cut out the middleman what if we just sprinkled some gelatin right into a pan sauce the same way you would with starch or something just to use it as a thickener in this case i've done some mushrooms with my hanger steak those mushrooms will provide a lot of that umami we would get from the reduced meat broth deglaze with red wine and a little water and then i'll just sprinkle on my gelatin you won't know what its final thickness is going to be until you let it cool to eating temperature it thickens as it cools needs a little more gelatin for thickening i'll stir in some whole sage leaves and to keep the experiment pure there's no butter at all in this pan all of that texture is provided by the gelatin and yeah that is pretty damn good it makes you wonder if demi-glace and all kinds of classic meat dishes would have evolved quite differently if refined gelatin had always been readily available in the mirror universe where that happened me with a goatee is probably saying yeah i mean if you're in like some kind of crazy survival situation where you can't get powdered gelatin you could i guess take like a billion animal parts and put them in a pot and boil them for like a day but i mean that'd be crazy that'd be like boiling down 50 watermelons to get a cup of sugar to bake with long live the empire,3
Why French macarons and coconut macaroons have the same name,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nzcHeO43kgE/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLD-SpQjbBrIgUGzmGcHLNtHj9fkXw,nzcHeO43kgE,"11 minutes, 43 seconds","Thanks to Harry's for sponsoring this video!

YOU...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.187352," It is not a coincidence that this classic
French dessert is called a macaron and this one from here in the United States is called
a macaroon. Etymologically speaking, it's the same word. These are simply local variations
in spelling and pronunciation. The modern French variant, macaron, only started getting
popular in English about 15 years ago. And that is why a lot of us English-speakers who
happen to be much older than 15 just call this a French macaroon, not a macaron. These two foods have the same name because
they are the same food — different versions of the same dessert. That might be pretty
hard to believe by looking at them, but it's true. I'm going to prove it to you. In fact,
there are all kinds of superficially disparate treats from all over the world that share
the same etymological and culinary ancestor, which is not French, but rather Italian. I
bet if I gave you a second, you could think of an Italian food word that sounds an awful
lot like a macaroon. Macaroni. That's the English spelling of macaroni; in Italy it's
spelled like this. Macaroon and macaron and all of the other
historic renderings of that word come from macaroni, so says the Oxford English Dictionary.
Though the OED, like other etymological authorities, is not super sure about where the word macaroni
comes from. There are a few theories. The word macaroni first shows up in English in
1611, describing ""round peeces of paste, boyled in water and put into a dish with butter,
spice and grated-cheese vpon them."" That sounds like gnocchi to me — little flour dumplings,
maybe with some potato in them, as opposed to the tubular pasta that we call macaroni
today. Now what do gnocchi and macaroni and macaroons
and macarons all have in common? Well, they're all made out of pastes. The British scholar
of Italian history, John Dickie, traces macaroni back to a Latin word, maccare, meaning to
crush or to bruise or to pound — basically to smash, like you would smash up grains to
make flour that you would then mix with liquid to produce a paste we call a dough. Another
possible progenitor of the word macaroni is a Byzantine Greek word, makaria, which means
barley broth or some kind of food made of barley. It strikes me that these two potential
etymologies for macaroni might both be correct. Maybe maccare and makaria sound similar because
they are related. After all, you probably would smash or pulverize barley before eating
it, right? The same way that you would pulverize wheat into flour to make dough for gnocchi
or macaroni. But of course, macaroons usually don't have
any wheat or barley or any grain at all in them. Neither do macrons. These are actually
two of the great incidentally gluten free desserts. People with celiac disease can enjoy
these without altering the traditional recipes. In the case of these, the paste is not made
with grains but rather with nuts. A French macaroon is made by mixing almond flour or
almond paste with sugar and beaten egg whites. If you just mixed almond paste with sugar,
you'd have marzipan — a very heavy, solid substance. If you mix the nuts and sugar with
egg foam (meringue) that creates the light, airy structure that you get in a wheat-based
cookie by trapping gas from a leavening agent in a glutenous web. If you just take plain
meringue, egg whites and sugar, and you drop it into little dollops on a sheet and then
you bake it, you will have these: meringue cookies. In the case of macarons or macaroons,
these are meringues, but meringues that have pulverized nuts inside them — almonds in
this case, or sometimes pistachios, people use. Other things over here — we'll get
back to that. The fact that the French got their name for
this treat from the Italians certainly reinforces the commonly held belief that they got the
recipe from the Italians. Amaretti, ricciarelli, pignoli, these are all traditional Italian
meringue cookies made with almonds. The Italians probably got the idea from the Middle East
— marzipan after all is a word of Persian and/or Arabic origin. And in Syria and Lebanon,
they have traditional almond meringue cookies called, I'm going to need a Vinegar Legate
to help me pronounce this. Take it, Mohammed. ""Hey Adam. In Beruit, I think they would pronounce
it lawziyeh. In Saudi, they would pronounce it lawziyeh. Good luck with the video."" Thank you, Mohammed. It just comes from the
Arabic word for almond. There are a lot of stories out there. And I cannot trace them
back to primary sources. But one story is that the Arabs introduced the macaroon to
Italy via their conquest of Sicily. That would be in the 9th century. There's a story that
ricciarelli here were introduced to Siena by a nobleman who brought them back from the
Crusades. It is notable to me that the earliest known English language recipe for French macaroons
from 1617 is flavored with — wait for it — rosewater. But if the Italians got this idea from the
Arabs, or maybe the Turks, how'd the French get the idea from the Italians? Well, again,
I can find absolutely no sourcing to back this up, but it's a very, very common story
that it was this lady: the Florentine noblewoman Catherine de' Medici. She brought her cooks
with her when she was married to the future King Henry II of France in 1533. That's how
an Italian cookie ended up in the French court, or so goes the story — the timing of which
certainly lines up with the etymological evidence. The OED has macaroon first showing up in French
language in the 16th century, and that's when Catherine arrived. I should tell you, there's a totally different
theory. This very popular culinary encyclopedia traces macaroons not to a 16th century Italian
French queen, but to eighth century French nuns. That's a really big difference. Well,
no doubt, over many centuries there's been lots of cultural exchange between France and
Italy and various Islamic peoples, so it seems to me quite possible that all of these explanations
are true. But regardless, to understand how that fine
European pastry evolved into this — this sloppy American coconut ball — his is going
to require us to split some semantic hairs with the precision of a fine German razor,
the likes of which you can buy from Harry's, the sponsor of this video. I've been shaving
with Harry's since they started about eight years ago. I didn't like how other men's razors
looked like gaudy, over-designed athletic shoes, and were similarly overpriced — neither
did Harry's founders, Jeff and Andy. So they bought a blade factory in Germany and they
started making these elegant, simple precision instruments that give you an amazing shave
for less money. Blade refills are just two bucks each, delivered right to your door so

cause. If you hit my link in the description, you can get a trial set like this for just
$3. Harrys.com/adamragusea for this three buck set. Thank you, Harry's. So anyway, how did this become this? Well,
remember that both of these are leavened with whipped egg foam, as opposed to a normal cookie,
which would be made with wheat or some other kind of grain and then leavened with yeast
or a chemical leavener like baking soda, baking powder, etc. The fact that these have no wheat
and no leavening makes either one of them suitable for the feast of Passover. This is
when Jews traditionally avoid leavened grains. Jews do this in memory of the story from Exodus
when Moses says, ""Let my people go,"" and after some rather harsh divine arm-twisting, Pharaoh
agrees. The Israelites, In their haste to GTFO from their bondage, don't have time to
let their bread dough rise before they pack up. They eat crude unleavened bread on the
journey. So because nutty meringue cookies were kosher for Passover, they naturally became
very popular among European Jews, who later immigrated en masse to America. And when they
got here, they encountered this: shredded, dried (or ""desiccated"") coconut. In 1894, a Philadelphia flour miller with
the on-the-nose name of Franklin Baker received a boatload of coconuts from Cuba. And he found
that he could greatly extend their shelf life and make them far easier for consumers to
actually eat by shredding and drying the flesh. Baker's Coconut was born. It was only natural
for people to eventually try replacing the almond or pistachio or whatever they were
using in this with coconut, even though coconut is not, strictly botanically speaking, a nut. The modern American macaroon recipe that Jewish
friends introduced me to when I was growing up is as follows. A standard 14 ounce bag
of sweetened shredded coconut mixed with another gloriously modern convenience food — sweetened
condensed milk. Standard 14 ounce can of that. Maybe put in a glug of vanilla and a pinch
of salt, then separate out two egg whites. Beat them up to reasonably stiff peaks and
fold them in. If you're fancy, you pipe this mixture out through a big star tip — or
you just roll fuzzy snowballs in your hands. Bake for half an hour or so at 325 F, just
until you see the edges going golden, and you can eat them just like that. Or a lot
of people would let them cool, dip the bottoms into melted chocolate, and then let those
cool until solid. It's a big sloppy mixture of cultures and industrial products — just
like America. Love it. But of course, while all of that evolution
was occurring stateside, it kept evolving in Europe too. This macaroon kept getting
more and more, well, French — delicate, pretty, fussy. This precise version with the
perfectly smooth domes and ruffled feet sandwiching together some kind of filling between them
— this was developed in Paris in the 1930s. That's why they're sometimes called Parisian
macaroons, or Gerbet macaroons. That's after a patisserie who claimed to have invented
them, Claude Gerbet. And if we look at English-language publications
from the 20th century, and into the 21st, we see this style of French macaroon sandwich
referred to as French macaroons, with two Os. You'll find some people, including myself
I realized, calling them French macarons, but you could argue that's redundant, since
macaron is simply the modern French word for macaroon. It'd be like calling this a Japanese
katana. ""What does katana mean?"" ""It means Japanese sword."" You've got to watch ""Samurai Cop."" Link in
the description. Anyway, if we search Google Ngrams for the
French spelling, macaron, we can see its occurrence rapidly increasing in English-language publications
starting around 2005. What was happening then? Well, French macaroons were simply becoming
very trendy around here. You saw it in every hipster neighborhood — cute little macaron
shops popping up on every gentrified street corner, selling these for several dollars
a pop. I definitely saw it where I was living in Boston at the time — macaron shops and
overpriced cupcake shops everywhere, and they naturally went with the fancier French spelling.
And I think a result of this trend was this new semantic distinction: a lot of people
would assert nowadays that this is a macaron and this is a macaroon. Different names for
different treats. And I think that's perfectly fine if you want to go that way — just know
that this is a very recent evolution of the language, and the term French macaroon will
probably only die with fogeyish cranks like Old Man Ragusea. Anyway, enjoy your nutty
meringue cookie, whatever you want to call it.",3

***RECIPE, SERVES 6-8°°°...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.187352, a classic british shepherd's pie may be the greatest cold weather dish ever and if you cook it the whole way in a big cast iron instead of transferring it to a casserole or something it's a pretty efficient meal plus you get more brown crust per bite when you bake it in something wide and shallow a big 12 inch cast iron or any oven safe pan is fine and it's a shepherd's pie so we need some shepherd i mean sheep two pounds of ground lamb almost a kilo and i'm just putting it into a dry cold pan and smooshing it out into a wide thin disc i'll turn the heat on high under that and it'll render out enough fat to cook itself while it's getting started i'll prep my vegetables and while i'm loath to admit it i do like this thing i got from gordon ramsay where you grate the carrots and onion rather than chopping them you could chop them but grated they seem to form a structural mesh that helps bind the filling together in the pie that's one big onion and three or four carrots and over here i can smell that my mince is browning on the bottom brits call it mince even though it's ground not minced a stout wooden spoon is really the only tool for a job like this and as i stir the veg in and break everything up you can see the literal base of brown flavor i've already got and we can get more but first we've got to evaporate a ton of water out of this pan about five minutes after the veg went in i can feel things drying out so i'm going to reduce the heat to medium at this stage things could get out of control really fast and burn once i start seeing a carpet of brown stuff forming on the pan that i can't readily scrape up i know i've done about all i can do got to deglaze soon so in goes a huge squeeze of tomato paste maybe a quarter cup and a quarter cup of flour 30 grams if you want your filling to be really solid inside the pie you could use like twice that much flour i don't want it to be too gluey i'll stir and cook that for as long as i can until burning is imminent which is just going to be a couple of minutes in there we got to get that off the bottom you know i'm going to use white wine i think it's amazing how much it improves a dish like this it just makes it so much brighter and fresher in the end i'm putting in half a bottle and scraping until the bottom of this pan is clean a lot of people like red wine and this if you use it i recommend half as much or it'll get bitter and if you don't want to use alcohol water or stock is fine with a big slash of balsamic vinegar if you want that same sweetness and acidity you can add the vinegar to taste at the end now more flavorings i think you almost can't have enough worcestershire sauce like give me a whole bottle or at least half a cup 120 mls dried herbs i'm doing a ton of dried thyme and sage you're flavoring not only the mince but the potato topping too so i think it should be really strong garlic powder is phenomenal in something like this where it can really rehydrate and i like some mustard powder too if you got it no salt until we can taste for seasoning because the worcestershire sauce is so salty and then just enough water or stock to cover everything stir that all in and then i will simply reduce it to a simmer and let it cook down until thick i think the texture is really better if you give it an extra half hour at least to stew like this and dissolve some collagen or whatever and if you're a lucky duck like me and you've got a few ice cubes of chef john style homemade demi-glace in the freezer now is a great time to deploy them a big spoonful of store-bought stock concentrate or something would perform a similar function or a stock cube you just won't get the luscious texture the demi-glass provides and now it's time to consider the considerably less healthier layer of the pie potatoes i'm marginally able to get away with eating this because for breakfast i enjoy the sponsor of this video magic spoon

for five bucks off thank you magic spoon now back to the empty carbs i've got two pounds or almost a kilo of floury potatoes here russets i prefer their texture on a shepherd's pie but you do gotta peel them their skins have this horrible wet paper bag texture when boiled i'll just hack those into chunks for faster and more even cooking i like a relatively thin potato layer on my pie if you want something more like equal parts potato and meat filling you could almost double the potatoes here fill that up with water bring it to a boil and simmer until very fork tender not like that like that falling apart when you stab them drain them through a gap in the pot lid and you don't have to get a big colander dirty this is a two-pot dinner time for butter and you know they like a bit of shepherd's pie in ireland too i'm doing a whole darn stick of butter you could use less heat is off and i'll just let it melt in there in the residual heat while i finish up the meat you want to reduce this until it's quite thick or else it won't hold together at all in the pie time to taste and make final adjustments i'll grind in a huge amount of pepper and i think i want some more garlic powder and a big pinch of salt i love this kind of meal because there should be no surprises you can taste every element before it's done and if it needs some more sweetness or more acid or more salt or anything you can just stir it in and taste again you can't lose now fully off the hot burner this comes the cooler this is the more viscous it is and the more viscous it is the easier it will be to spread our potatoes on top they won't just sink speaking of which i'll put in a glug of milk and a pinch of salt to start with and start mashing might could put in some more milk it should look looser than you want it at this stage because we're going to put in more stuff that will cause it to thicken and set later cheese a lot of people put in parmesan feels wrong to me i'm just putting in some sharp english cheddar looks like i did maybe 50 grams there a couple ounces and then egg yolks these are what make the potato topping set into a puffy solid pie crust plus they taste great two should do it i'll get that all mixed in and then taste for seasoning needs more salt and there we are at the last possible second i'll chop up a little fresh rosemary from my plant and dump that in you don't have to have that also at the last second a whole 10 ounce bag of frozen peas that's 280 grams you do that at the last second and you're going to keep the peas from being disgustingly overcooked by the end plus if they're frozen they're going to cool this down which makes it more solid and therefore easier to top smooth everything off conversely the potato topping should be still hot when you put it on otherwise it won't flow as easily as you're trying to spread it around you can make things a lot easier by depositing it in drops all over the pie now you simply don't have to spread it as far to reach the edge i like kind of pulling it with the spatula scraping and pulling toward the edge it can be a little tricky to do this without mixing the filling up with the potato but if that happens it really doesn't matter much and you certainly don't have to make a seal or anything i just like how the topping goes brown and crispy on the pan edge the more irregular the potato top the more browned surface area you'll have hence the tradition of forking the top i'm just doing a spiral pattern for fun and in this will go to an already hot oven 400 fahrenheit 200c a convection fan is good and it's good that this pan is not quite filled to the brim because it's going to bubble and puff up here we are after a half hour and see it's done when it's bubbly and puffy if you're not happy with the browning you've got you could always turn on the top element the broiler at the very end i've got some chives i'm going to slice up and scatter over top i'll be honest and say i'm probably only doing that for the thumbnail and the trick is just letting this rest and cool for at least 20 minutes i'm scooping it here after 10 minutes and you can see how hot it still is and therefore how liquid it is still darn tasty though that potato topping is so puffy if you're more patient and let it cool a little bit longer you're going to get a more solid texture on that filling i love how it's slightly sweet against the salty potato the white wine helps with that so go out provision yourself for the winter and as the brits would say tuck in,3

bunch of fruits and vegetables under a microscope camera yes that's literally the whole video and i'm so excited we're sponsored today by squarespace follow me in so we start with broccoli and we get in close here and it kind of looks like a whole bunch of brussels sprouts because that's basically what it is brussels sprouts are buds and these are buds flower buds if you don't harvest broccoli on time you will get it blooming into these very pretty little yellow flowers but it starts to taste very bitter at that point cauliflower another brassica just like the broccoli just like cabbage they're all cultivars of the original wild cabbage which grew on limestone cliffs around europe so superficially cauliflower looks a lot like broccoli but these are not flowers what they are is a tissue called meristem basically a stem cell a plant stem cell kind of a blank cell just ready to be turned into anything the plant needs it to be and then we have the romanesco which is super pretty it's another kind of cauliflower and what's cool about them is that they grow in these fractal patterns so it looks like a castle artichoke along with capers and the broccoli it's a flower bud that we eat one giant bud and it's a thistle so you can see the thorn at the tip of each one of these leaves called a bract a bract is a kind of leaf that grows as part of the flower those inner leaves you can eat whole assuming the plant is young enough over here you can see the heart that's sort of the part that people really like going into the stem and then here is the part that everyone is scared of this is the choke the choke is the actual immature flower petals which kind of isn't super pleasant to eat lettuces lettuces are not just like tender cabbages they are the leaves from members of the daisy family here if i light it from behind you should be able to really see what we're talking about those are the lateral veins which make up so the circulatory system delivering water and nutrients and everything going to uh the mid rib which is the kind of central vascular system that runs up through the middle of each sleeve see the edges there kind of starting to decay look at a red leaf variety generally whenever you see anything purple or red or blue in fruits and vegetables it's these chemicals called anthocyanins anthocyanins scientists think might play some role in protecting plants or leaves in particular from cold stress whatever this guy has has some pretty uh interesting vascular system going on let's move on to herbs yes brits everybody drops the h in herbs in north american english it's not just me in botany an herb is like a leafy plant that does not have a woody stem in a culinary sense herbs are just like basically any plant or a leafy plant that has a really strong taste so strong that you kind of wouldn't eat it just by itself you use it to flavor other things and here's parsley which is a member of the uh a pasee family a paseo not sure how you say that but it's the same family as carrots and coriander and dill and cumin a whole bunch of things that was flat leaf this of course is curly parsley which i don't know does this only exist to be sort of a sad little garnish alongside omelets it just doesn't taste as strong as the flat leaf variety it's just sort of pretty it stands up on the plate and it's hearty it doesn't wilt easily good for a food service environment right a giant member of that same epacey family as the parsley is a celery of course you can tell that just by looking at its leaves and the leaves are actually like a delicious herb of course the main thing that we eat with celery is the stock which is basically just a giant swollen uh petiole the sort of stem that immediately attaches to the leaf and if you look back on the look over at the parsley that's the petiole there too it's just a much more reasonable size we cut it open we can see and so those big circles are the xylem and the phloem you know the the circulatory system xylem up and flow them down my dad always used to say to help me remember which was which going back to the herbs here's a thyme which is a different family this is the mint family that includes like basil and sage and salvia and oregano lots of stuff like that interesting i never noticed the little hairs that seems to be on time see it on the stems especially you see hair is much more prominently on a sage which is part of the same family those little hairs are called trichomes you know those look exactly like sage leaves when you look at them under the microscope in the case of herbs the trichomes might be a glandular meaning that they actually like secrete essential oils that make the plant taste the way it does to us speaking of trichomes we can move right along now to fruits fuzzy peaches these are trichomes fuzz apparently plays like a lot of rolls especially like a little umbrella it kind of holds water up and away from the surface of the fruit which would uh sort of keep it from getting infected with funguses i suppose that kind of thing while at the same time it retains a layer of water up above the fruit which keeps it from drying out kiwi is the same deal not all the varieties are fuzzy but the ones we see in the states are usually quite fuzzy another potential function of the hairs is to repel bugs like spikes in like a retaining wall where they don't want people to sit on it right spikes would just get in your way if you were a little bug cut in half see those pretty little seeds you can see them each attached to the placenta that's with the the white thing in the center that little kind of pipe or vein connecting the placenta to the seed but you can see it really clearly there look at that also hairy but a different kind of hair is raspberries in this case the hairs are styles uh remember that all fruits come out of flowers that's what makes them fruits and so that's basically a remnant of the flower peeking through there like a finer hair on each of the drooplets and so those little bags of juice are called drooplets each one contains a seed i want to look right down the chasm oh that looks like something out of alien staying with berries let's look at uh grapes and what i'm interested to see here is the bloom that's the kind of powdery white stuff that you see around it people think it's some kind of like pesticide residue or something but it is a very natural part of the plant it protects the the fruit is kind of host to a lot of microorganisms and stuff most notably yeast they are the ones that would convert this into wine cut out a little cross section look inside grapes that we eat out of hand are seedless grapes nowadays we've bred the seeds out of them grapes for wine would have a big fat seed right there while we're talking about berries we should talk about tomatoes because they are not vegetables they are berries they grow on a vine out of a flower just like a grape does we cut it open and look inside we can see a lot more these uh that's the placenta there the white kind of stuff and uh the kind of compartment around it is called the locule and that's where the sort of gel is surrounding the seeds we're talking about berries we also got to talk about eggplant not a vegetable a berry and the fun fact about those seeds is that they are bitter because they're alkaloids specifically they are nicotinoid alkaloids they're related to tobacco nicotine and of course while we're talking about berries we also have to talk about peppers capsicums chilies and that is where most of the capsaicin is concentrated in the placental tissue you know anytime anybody like is cooking on tv or the internet like me and we'll say like hey if you want to like limit the heat of this chili you could just uh you know take out the ribs and seeds pet ants always like to point out that oh there's actually no capsaicin in the seeds it's in the ribs well yeah but like you physically can't remove the ribs without also removing the seeds and secondly the kind of little tissue around the seeds that can have a whole lot of capsaicin in it too and also while we're talking about berries we also got to talk about green beans too yes technically legumes are fruits that's where traditionally there's a really nasty bit of fiber called the string that has been bred out of green beans that i get at the store anymore they're all stringless but it used to be that you'd have to pull the string out of each one before you ate it and then you go cut it open and you've got the beans or they're seeds really they're the seeds of the fruit and with a green bean they're just very immature which is why the pod is still tender and edible but if you were to like let this keep getting older you would have beans if you let the beans sprout you'll have bean sprouts sprout just meaning like the very beginning of the new plant that is coming up out of the seed there i think you can see the little remnants of the bean that the sprout came up out of right there that brown thing and while we're talking about berries we might as well talk about the berry that's not actually a berry which is strawberries not a berry because the fleshy part does not grow up out of the ovary uh the ovary is actually what we would call the seed on the exterior and inside each one of those ovaries is a seed dragon fruit it's a cactus fruit super cool looking and i don't know what those little seed looking things in the skin are but they're not seeds because you cut it open and there's the seeds suspended in that pulp there banana nearly uh any banana that you buy at the store is going to be the uh cavendish variety the cavendish like a lot of big commercial fruit varieties has had the seeds bred out of it either like totally bred out or in this case they've been bred so that like they just they'll never mature they never get big they never get to the point where they're kind of crunchy so citrus in the outer skin of the citrus fruit you've got all of these really really powerful essential oils that are in these teeny little sacks cut in half if i get a cross section there and that green line right on the top there you can see oil sacks and then on the flesh you've got those little juice vesicles is what those are called little teeny bags of juice we'll talk about the big one the pineapple uh it's actually a multiple fruit so it's like a big cluster of lots of fruits all kind of stuck to each other each of these things on the outside is a bract just like the artichoke a leaf that's part of a flower and the kind of dry papery tips on the outside are actually the remnants of flower petals all radiating around the core and there's a seed there watermelon another one of these uh seedless not actually bread out the seeds they've just sort of bred them to be permanently immature like some of us moving on to the roots here's a carrot and with any kind of tuber or rhizome or tap root what you're talking about is a root that has swollen to function not just as like a tube for sucking water out of the ground but also as an energy storage medium these little kind of dents in the side these lines are called lateral root scars and if we look oh yep there's a root hair still stuck to the scar that it came out of potatoes of course the other really big swollen root that we eat if you look on the surface those are pores and used for kind of gas exchange with the outside world until you get to the big ones and that is an eye and the eye is the bud for the the new plant that'll grow up out of that in fact over here you can see some eyes that are actually like sprouting this potato's starting to get too old crack open this purple one beautiful little purple potatoes this is totally natural i mean to the extent that any of this is natural it's all been sort of cultivated through selective breeding and such for thousands of years but the purple ones come from the andes in south america and uh again it's just anthocyanin and what you see like the color variation on the inside is uh the wider stuff is pith it's vascular tissue uh that is just kind of delivering nutrients and water and stuff same deal in the other varieties it's just the color contrast is not as extreme so it's hard to see all right lastly the alliums onions it's a cluster of leaves that gets super swollen again serves as an energy storage medium for the plant during the winter during its dormancy purple onion again purple because of anthocyanins anything that can be purple in my kitchen shall be then of course you got your scallions here which is again isn't just another kind of onion concentric leaves all wrapped around each other not actually a stem what i really want to see under the microscope is the roots gross they look like little sea creatures well that was an awful lot of fun hey don't forget that people are putting you under the microscope when

cold weather meals ever a classic grilled cheese sandwich that you can dip into some homemade tomato soup you'd want to get the soup on first but i have a feeling a lot of you are here for the sandwich so let's just start with that to me a classic grilled cheese just has three ingredients fluffy white factory made pre-sliced sandwich bread american cheese referred to abroad as processed cheese or cheese slices and a large quantity of softened butter that's it either butter at room temperature or you can throw cold butter into a microwave at low power just give it 10 or 20 seconds pull it out flip it around another quick hit and there we go not melted but easily slathered onto both slices of bread an obscene amount is called for when it hits the pan the outer layer of the butter will make the bread toast up all brown and crispy while the inner layer of the butter will just kind of melt into the interior of the bread where it won't brown it will stay sweet it's a magical combination any pan is fine but nonstick is foolproof it's on medium heat first slice goes in butter side down on goes two slices of cheddar and or colby cheese ground up and reconstituted with vegetable oil and emulsifying salts aka american cheese and my secret fourth ingredient which is just a little dusting of garlic powder i'm a fan of garlic powder and this is perhaps my favorite deployment of it second slice of bread goes on better side up and the crucial step cover it a lid is great if you have one but foil is fine it doesn't have to be an airtight seal just enough to retain some steam in there the steam is what will melt the cheese just be sure to check on it often those processed sandwich breads are full of sugar and can burn in a flash i do like mine just on the edge of burning before i flip quite dark and crispy don't worry if the cheese still isn't looking terribly melty cover it up the steam will melt it by the time side 2 is brown i often like to give it a few final flips uncovered just to get both sides hot and crispy look at that cheese nothing melts like processed cheese slices they make those for a reason unnaturally smooth gooey cheese now a lot of people maintain that mayonnaise not softened butter is the best thing to slather on your bread it's certainly more convenient you don't have to warm it up first if you like the mayo method i respect your choices but i am not a fan yes it seems to result in a crispier crust i'm not sure why it might be the lower water content compared to butter it might be the egg protein in it i don't know i just know that i think the flavor is very inferior to butter if you use low heat and grill it until just golden the mayo kind of tastes like nothing if you grill it until dark it develops this awful fishy flavor i couldn't tell you why here lauren has never had the mayo version let's give her a blind taste test grilled cheese should always be cut in triangles it's the law i like the triangles too but i think you should cut yours however you like it that's the butter version she's trying though she doesn't know it now here's the mayo version i don't know why it seems to have a seafood flavor am i just like conjuring up tuna salad again lots of people love the mayo trick if you're curious about it i say try it just maybe don't cook it as brown as you might with the butter version that's the version that gets me thinking about my mom making lunch on a snow day i would eat it with my puffy gloves and coat drying over the electric heater behind my chair at the kitchen table i will love that sandwich always but a slightly more sophisticated grilled cheese i like sometimes would use rye bread rye bread goes particularly well with tomato soup butter it up in it goes and i'll put on a slice of real sharp cheddar and a slice of swiss a little garlic powder again just gives it so much more depth and another piece on butter side up yeah you could just melt a ton of butter into the pan and then drop the dry sandwich into that the bread would absorb it but you'd probably end up wasting more butter and the butter would brown pretty heavily i like having that fresh sweet butter taste up inside the bread in addition to the brown crust if you're using real cheese and you want it to be gooey put a little water in the pan halfway through and seal with a tight lid it won't be gooey like the processed stuff but a good amount of steam will help the cheese pull more like that it makes it stretchy and grilled cheese is just as easy as that as easy as making dinner with the sponsor of this video hellofresh let's thank them before we make the soup lauren's been making all kinds of things since we signed up for america's number one meal kit delivery service it's really helped me build my confidence with cooking i used to always be kind of panicked when it was cooking and following the instructions and having all you know the pictures you can't mess it up and doing that enough i feel like i've gotten just better overall plus the hellofresh recipes are tasty we usually get the vegetarian plan it just nudges us to eat meatless more often but there's meaty plans locale plans pescatarian lots of options and you can change your plan put deliveries on hold whatever something i like is you end up wasting a lot less food because you're not going to the grocery store and buying

meals with my link and code in the description thanks hellofresh now homemade tomato soup it's the easiest thing ever clank up an onion we're going to puree this later so precision cutting is moot here you don't have to do this but i like fennel bulb in tomato soup if you plan to strain the soup later you can chop up the stalks and put them in but if you're going to have it chunky style i recommend only using the bulb the stalks have little fibers in them that kind of get stuck in your throat if you don't strain them out i'm just shaving this kind of fine so it'll cook in the same time as the onion nice subtle licorice flavor there you could use oil but i like to use butter you could use a quarter this much better but i think a ton of butter really helps tomato soup taste like a soup and not just a bowl of tomato sauce in goes the onion and fennel on medium heat i just want to give these a head start without browning anything i'll grind in some pepper and highly optional some celery seeds i love that flavor with the tomatoes and fennel and if you get the seeds in early they'll soften by the time you eat last thing maybe a quarter cup of flour 30 grams stir that into the butter to make a roux that'll give the soup a nice velvety texture again we're going to puree it so don't worry about lumps before anything browns in goes the tomatoes and their juice one of the advantages of making your own tomato soup instead of eating the canned stuff is you can use better tomatoes garden tomatoes in the summer or really high quality canned ones in the winter these ones from california are really top-notch hashtag not an ad i've got two 28-ounce cans in there and if you've got whole tomatoes you could just let them cook and break apart naturally but you can't accelerate things with a potato masher this will just help them cook quicker and you could use more tomatoes but again my goal is to make it taste like tomato soup instead of tomato sauce and i find it helps on that score to keep the proportion of non-tomato ingredients relatively high a lot of people put in a bunch of chicken or veggie stock now you could do that i tend to prefer plain water in vegetable soups but you know it's been a while like a glass of white wine this will certainly need more moisture before we're done but you can always add you can't subtract so i generally start soups on the dry side and then add water at the end to taste i'll turn the heat down just to let that simmer for maybe an hour tops scrape the bottom every now and then so nothing sticks and burns meanwhile for garnish i'm gonna grab a little pot and make some quick chili oil you can buy it but it's easy to make i'll just dump in some dried chili flakes into a little olive oil you could use way more than that if you want it super spicy and i'll put in a crushed garlic clove the garlic tastes good and the water in it serves as a thermometer if it's just barely sizzling that means that you've got enough heat to infuse the oil without creating any burned flavors i'll just let that infuse on low heat while the soup cooks you'll see why here we are like 40 minutes later and it's time to puree this i love immersion blenders so much so much less work than getting out a food processor transferring the soup over and then cleaning it after plus this gives you more control you don't have to blitz this totally smooth if you don't want to i'll just run that under the faucet and put it away time to give this a taste it needs a ton of salt and some water too thick for me and i do wish it was a little more tomatoey so i'll squeeze in some tomato paste a lot of people add some sugar at this stage if the tomatoes aren't naturally sweet enough these are now i really like that kind of crude texture however if you want to you can strain this sieve over a bowl and then just put in only as much as you can work with at a time you just take a stiff spoon and grind the soup into the sieve it takes a minute a food mill would perform this function a little more efficiently but a sieve and a spoon works too and pretty soon you'll just have a ball of plant fibers in the sieve underneath you'll have the super smooth texture that you might be familiar with from the canned tomato soups i like both textures what i don't like about any pureed soup is it's homogeneity it's like baby food every bite is exactly the same that's what the chili oil fixes you spoon that on and it just floats at the top and creates some nice variety as you eat you can dose it onto each spoonful however you like plus you can also pick some of the fronds off of that fennel chop them up and scatter those on too very nice and then you can just dip the corner of that sandwich in there that's why i like the triangle shape an unbeatable cold weather combination that recipe makes a lot of soup just freeze the rest and save it for a snowy day now excuse me i have a date with that bit of crispy cheese there,3

kind of hard to believe if like me you don't come from a culture where people eat cactus but nearly every part of this plant is edible and potentially quite tasty there are obviously hazards hazards both glaring and insidious i'm going to tell you everything i learned trying to prepare this very angry plant for human consumption parts of me still hurt lots of cacti have edible parts but this is a classic a prickly pear known to science as the opuntia genus it's named after the city of opus in ancient greece which was reputed to have an edible plant that could be grown by simply jamming its leaves into the ground the leaves would send out roots and indeed you can grow prickly pear that way just take basically any chunk of the plant stick it in the ground and it can send out roots however this almost certainly was not the plant in ancient opus that theophrastus wrote about why because like most cactuses opuntia is native to the americas and that genus includes hundreds of distinct species abundant across the warmer parts of the western hemisphere very big and latin american cuisine i have no idea which particular species of prickly pear this is because it's just a random plant hanging out in my neighborhood in macon georgia in front of this vacant lot the house here burned down a few years ago whomever lived here many decades ago planted this cactus right on the border with their neighbor which tells you a lot about what their relationship must have been like i've walked by that plant thousands of times and like half of the year it has these big purple fruits on it and they are true fruits berries they have soft sweet and sour flesh containing a pulpy core of little seeds in spanish they call the fruit tuna no etymological relation to tuna fish as far as i can tell applied to cactus fruit tuna is a word of indigenous american origin the tuna grow up from the outer leaves called paddles or pads or in spanish nopales both the tuna and the nopales are edible but are best at different times of the year the tuna generally ripen in the fall it's actually winter here right now it's new year's day as i record this and there's still a ton of fruit ripening on that plant most people seem to agree the best paddles or nopales are the new growth paddles that sprout up in the springtime those are lighter green and more tender than the mature paddles that we see on here right now you can tell the tuna are ripe when they are of course no longer green like that one and when they twist almost effortlessly off the plant yeah twisting i found is the motion you want to use not pulling and yes for god's sake use tongs the first time i tried to harvest fruit from that thing i thought oh this is going to be easy i can see the spines really really clearly all i have to do is just kind of grab between the spines bad idea because lurking around all those big conspicuous thorns are many more nearly microscopic ones called glowkids or glochidia and these are hairy little demons straight from the fires of hades they are the worst some varieties of prickly pear have more glow kids than others and it may depend on the season but basically any time i've gotten near that thing i have noticed some weird tell-tale pains later if you look with a much more powerful microscope you can see the glow kids are barbed all you have to do is brush past them and they'll hook into your skin and release from the plant you might not even notice them going in and even if you do yeah you can pull out the parts that's above the skin but not the barbed tips they just break off and stay inside you and what does that feel like well i've got one in the tip of this finger right now and i don't feel it at all unless pressure is applied then i feel this minor but sharp pain that made typing this script this morning a lot of fun i also always noticed this generalized dull aching in my skin like a hand ache and it takes a few days to go away this may be due to a general inflammation or dermatitis caused by glo kids some people seem to have a particularly strong reaction to them and if you just carelessly brush past one of these plants when you're out hiking or something you could just instantaneously be covered in millions of these little glow kids it's going to be a problem in the 1980s some researchers at the st louis college of pharmacy found that you can almost entirely prevent the inflammation by immediately removing the exposed part of the glow kids with tweezers and then applying a household glue letting it dry and then ripping it off you basically give your glow kid tips a bikini wax just use tongs tongs are good and right now i bet some of you are thinking i'd rather just buy some food at the grocery store you know food that isn't

now as bad as glow kids feel on your skin imagine how they would feel on your tongue or in your throat let's talk about how you actually eat these a popular method among hikers is to eat them right off the plant you grab a stick and just poke the blossom end of the fruit with it just to hold it steady there's a little belly button there that you can poke then you just fillet off the sides of skin with your knife i've read in several botanical texts that ripe fruits will drop their glow kids they'll drop when they're really ripe for what it's worth there's lots of clearly very ripe fruit out on that plant right now and they still have tons of glow kids on them to the point where i needed to wipe the loose glow kids off my knife before i proceeded with this step where you just fillet the edible flesh right off the seed core in the middle the seeds aren't poisonous or anything but they are very hard you can't crunch through them like papaya seeds what does it taste like purple i think it tastes purple it has a generic fruity taste but also a slight vegetal taste as well which i actually quite like oh lordy there's a thorn there's a thorn ah nah i'm just kidding the less ripe ones are way more acidic but devotees will know that's just fine with me very nice but truthfully there just really isn't that much fruity flesh on this thing so much of it is those pulpy seeds so something that people do a lot of time is simply juice it because there's tons of good juice in that pulp problem is you can't just wash them and toss them in a blender the skin has all those glow kids in it and they're small enough to pass through a strainer and into your juice now i've seen some people simply grab the fruit with tongs put it under running water and just scrub away at it with a really stiff scrubby then you just have to wash and rinse it several times to make sure you have washed away all the loose glow kids maybe that works with the store-bought variety which i've noticed seem to have fewer glow kids on them but these are just covered in them so we have to do something else an ancient method among indigenous peoples is apparently to roll the fruits around in sand quite vigorously the abrasive sand theoretically dislodges all the prickles and then you can wash them off theoretically another traditional method is to kill them with fire now we're talking if you look really close you can actually see the glow kids igniting and shriveling up people who have gas stoves often do this over the flame from their burner that'd probably work a lot better than this little fire stick my kitchen torch is out of butane this is going to take forever you know we need now we're talking yeah die glow kids die the campfire is apparently a traditional method as well just don't keep them in the heat for too long or they will burst open then you can bring them inside and wash them off and people say you can then just cut them in half and simply peel the skin off with your fingers that did not work too well for me it would have helped if i trimmed off the blossom and stem ends first the skin really sticks around there i found the easiest thing for me was to hold the fruit upright with a fork and filet off the skin i imagine peeling with your fingers works better with the bigger store-bought fruit then you can mash them up by hand or just drop them in a blender or a food processor people usually put in a little water just to help everything flow around the blades and whizz it smooth strain out the seeds and pulp and there you have it people will boil that down and make candies with it or they'll just stir in some simple syrup maybe some lime juice and there you have a lovely little soft drink agua fresca de tuna i am simply going to spike mine with a little tequila and call it a day is it worth it i'm not so sure is it delicious absolutely oh the paddles the fresh nopales i see for sale in latin grocery stores seem to only have the big conspicuous thorns that you can easily shave off with a knife this one from the plant up the street has got tons of glow kids on it too so kill them with fire die die yeah you could just shave them off with the skin but when they inevitably fall off in the process they would get stuck in that very sticky flesh nopales are filled with mucilage that gluey polysaccharide that makes okra slimy texture-wise the slime does not bother me much at all when eating it raw and i do very much like it raw if the tuna or the fruit is sort of a vegetal tasting fruit the paddles the nopales are to me kind of sort of a fruity tasting vegetable it's like if green beans were a sour fruit though apparently if you harvest the pads in the morning their acid content will be lower the slime becomes much more unpleasant to me when you cook these in mexican food a lot of the times they will boil these and then strain and wash them to get a lot of that slime out well prepared they make a very tasty taco filling i have not well prepared them but there you have it be safe and go taste of the forbidden fruit if you dare,3
Easier pan pizza in a non-stick — browned base and crispy rim,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9TjUWnAK0cg/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLCTBHm3YSkgo8Iig2yk9qBDDdfbZQ,9TjUWnAK0cg,"9 minutes, 43 seconds","Thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this video!

squarespace here's a much easier much more reliable method for making a great pan pizza a pizza style pioneered in the american midwest and yes popularized by a global chain that rhymes with it's a glut they don't need my publicity you can absolutely use any pizza dough with this method but here's what i've been using for pan pizzas lately bread flour but all-purpose would be fine a cup to start with like 120 grams i actually put in a little too much you'll see half a teaspoon of salt maybe three grams two or three grams of sugar half a teaspoon and half a teaspoon of dry yeast a gram or two a little glug of olive oil maybe a couple of teaspoons and you don't have to do this but garlic powder inside the dough works great with a thick crust pizza in a thin crust too much of it would burn just a dash i'm only making one portion of dough here and instead of water i'm using milk pizza butt uses various powdered milk products in their crusts it makes for some very nice caramelly notes in the brown surface half a cup of milk some people say you got a scald milk before you use it in a yeast bread heating it to almost boiling deactivates enzymes or proteins in the milk that can interfere with the gluten and the rise i tried this dough with scalded milk and with milk straight from the fridge and i noticed absolutely no difference maybe because my milk is pasteurized i don't know i do know that i put in too much flour so more milk to balance it i think wet sticky doughs are better for pan pizza they bake up fluffier and when i'm kneading a tiny little ball of dough for just one pizza i kind of like to do it up in the air between my hands this is super easy you just kind of squish it and grind it between your palms it's oddly satisfying and it doesn't get the counter dirty let's see is it smooth and elastic enough that i can form a thin sheet without it tearing check form it into a smooth ball yeah i wish it was a little bit stickier but it's fine back into the bowl cover it up and let it rise for an hour or two this took two because my kitchen is super cold right now doubled in size you could absolutely do my normal thing where i put the dough straight in the fridge and let it ferment slowly for a few days that's good too but either way we're going to do a second rise in the pan i used to use cast iron for pan pizza but i have switched to my non-stick a 10 inch teflon pan with an oven safe handle you could use cast iron but i have found this makes it so much easier you'll see why just a little bit of olive oil in the pan too much and the pizza has a really fried taste to it just a dab and i do like to put some seasonings in this oil a little pinch of dried oregano basil chili flakes whatever you like and a tiny pinch of salt a little salt goes a long way here and then you just completely coat the pan this results in a distinct layer of flavor on the bottom of the pizza that is quite tasty heterogeneity and while my hands are still greasy i'll grab my dough ball and plop it in i used to stretch the dough first and then lay it in the pan i found it's easier to just mash it straight into the pan with my fingertips this also helps me to get a more even thickness throughout if you do traditional stretching up in the air the thick outer ring of dough you get tends to make all the sauce and cheese pool into the center with this style of pizza i'm stretching it up past the corner of the pan not because i want it up there but because i know this dough is going to contract before all is said and done so start wider than you want it i'll rub a thin layer of oil on top because it tastes good and because it'll keep this from drying out as it gets a second rise in the pan at least for a half an hour that really helps it bake up lighter and fluffier it tends to be kind of dense and doughy if you skip this second rise and while it's rising we can prep everything else for sauce i'm still on this particular make and model of canned tomatoes it's the best thing for pizza sauce i can find in u.s grocery stores when i can't find it i use another brand of crushed or ground tomatoes and i spike it with a little tomato paste for extra flavor i don't normally measure it but a third of a cup is perfect for a pan pizza this size imho here's my new favorite pizza herb marjoram smells like tea but tastes like oregano crossed with time maybe i'll also use some oregano and basil and a tiny pinch of sugar a little chili flakes black pepper and a dab of olive oil stir it all up and that's it if it looks like not quite enough sauce to me then it's probably exactly enough let's prep our cheese for new york style pizza i scour the earth for whole milk low moisture mozzarella but on my pan pizzas i've really been liking the part skim kind lately and this stuff is way easier to find it's got to be low moisture though that's an eight ounce block i'll use five or six ounces like 150 grams i miss the full fat flavor but the part skim kind just seems to brown better with this particular recipe and for that same reason i think it's particularly important to avoid pre-grated cheese for this the anti-clumping starch they put on the pre-grated stuff is particularly likely to burn with this method i'm gonna show you there we go and lastly i do like to put some grated parmesan over the sauce layer i suppose now's as good a time as any to admit that i prefer the pre-grated stuff for pizza i have real parmigiano-reggiano in the fridge right now i could use it but it just doesn't taste right on pizza to me the fake stuff tastes right to me last thing to prep is my topping whatever toppings you want are fine but this is my new favorite pizza topping a tiny clove of fresh garlic tiny because we're going to eat it raw and raw garlic is super strong just a couple little shavings of lemon zest the bright yellow part with as little of the underlying white pith as possible and then a little bunch of fresh parsley chop it all up and you've got gremolata the traditional last minute garnish for lots of italian dishes chopping those three ingredients into each other really does seem to spark a chemical reaction between them the result tastes like more than the sum of its parts a last minute sprinkling of that makes all kinds of things taste fresher and i don't know more sophisticated okay the dough has visibly puffed up a bit so we're ready to bake you can simply top your dough and then throw the whole pan into a screaming hot oven that's traditional but what i do is a lot more energy efficient it's easier to control and it gets you a much browner bottom heat on medium and at the same time i'll get my oven's broiler heating to max that's the element at the top of the oven it heats up in a flash and i've got a rack positioned pretty close to it after a minute i can see the dough puffing up and after four minutes i can smell it starting to brown with my old method i would start topping the pizza now but the way i cook it these days is to completely finish browning the bottom before anything else goes in you do it this way and you can use a soft spatula to lift up the dough and see exactly what's going on with the non-stick pan you can just kind of shake it like an omelette to make sure it's not stuck and you can move it or rotate it around if some parts seem to be browning more than others with my old method you'd have to guess when the bottom is perfect with this method there's no guessing you just cook it until you like the bottom i like it just starting to burn a little burning is part of what makes bread taste like pizza to me and there we are so off the heat this comes now there's no particular rush i'll just smooth my sauce around edge to edge no bare ring of crust around the edge the stuff on the sides of the pan will caramelize and go super sweet dust on a little parmesan or whatever you want to call this substance it really enhances the flavor and hiding it under the mozzarella layer keeps it from burning again edge to edge with the mutts those bits of cheese touching the sides of the pan are going to do magical things that's it and under the grill this goes brits call it a grill i find this pizza cooks much better and faster if i keep my oven door closed yes people say you should not put teflon under the broiler it could overheat and put off toxic fumes good advice but this is only going to be under there for literally two minutes i've done tests with my infrared thermometer the exposed teflon never got remotely close to the temperature at which ptfe starts to break down causing polymer fume fever in very high doses it never got close if you can't risk it or if you have a pet bird around use cast iron birds are super sensitive to polymer fumes but i'm super sensitive to pizza fumes and this smells awesome you just pull it when it's brown to your liking look at that crispy cheese on the edge and because i use the non-stick pan it's going to come right off i'll sprinkle on my gremolata you want to let this cool in the pan for just a few minutes just until it's solidified enough that you can get it out intact the sooner you get it out to a cooling rack the crispier the bottom will be and look with a non-stick you can literally just slide the pizza out like an omelet couldn't be easier now that it's on the rack where steam can escape you're safe to let this cool as long as you want before eating i like to let it cool way down hey look up there you can see that super dark and even brown bottom but it's got nothing i ain't seen before though there's no surprises here i always hated my old method where you just had to guess when the bottom was perfect though say it's not perfect maybe you didn't get out of the pan fast enough and now it's soggy you can very easily just re-fry this for a few minutes basically until you hear it start to sizzle again that'll bring the crust right back to life i've said in the past that i don't think pizza cutters are good for the home kitchen i prefer using a knife because a pizza cutter just tends to fall right off the edges of your little cutting board but with a pizza this small in diameter it's fine cut yours however you want i like small slices because they are so thick and so rich the milk has made that crust a little bit cakey in an awesome way that is just such a great guilty pleasure

My original...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.187352, this is what christmas is like for me i just know that it's the season when people show up in my mansions telling me that i'm dumb this video is sponsored by skillshare if i drop dead right now my obit will probably start thusly food youtuber adam ragusia noted for seasoning his ex instead of his why and dousing it in white wine passed away unexpectedly in his kitchen in macon georgia thursday and for this notoriety i am grateful because before lots of people started watching me play with food on the internet i was most famous for an episode that i would consider a low point of my life a moment where i had my two minutes hate when i drew the sustained ire of a ferocious beast known as music theory twitter how well with my appearance in a vox video about mariah carey's all i want for christmas is you i will now relate this tale to you from my point of view of course i think it offers a lot of good lessons about what can go wrong when you try to communicate any remotely esoteric ideas to a general audience and what can go wrong in the game of telephone from expert to journalist and then from journalist to audience and then from audience to audience of the audience's tweets or youtube videos but first you might be wondering why does adam care what music theory twitter says well it's because i used to be one of them or at least i aspired to be one of them i was a music kid i was really into theory but i was more into composition comp was my thing when i was 14 i started studying composition with a fellow named dr paul barsum who was on the music faculty at penn state i grew up in the town where penn state is and paul was just everything a young man could want in a mentor he was so helpful he was an outsider like me in the world of classical music in many ways we both sort of got into classical music by way of heavy progressive rock paul loved yes i loved the first four metallica albums particularly justice i wasn't one of the band kids i was kind of a misfit punk rock kid in fact i went to a alternative high school that was basically punk rock misfit high plus dnd kids it was absolutely wonderful but we didn't have band we didn't have orchestra and i wasn't particularly into mozart or anything like that my interest in classical music was in contemporary stuff at one of our lessons paul played me a piece by one of his teachers a wonderful composer named christopher rouse the piece was called gorgon [Music] and i thought that was the coolest damn thing i had ever heard in my life to put it in today's terminology roush gents i wanted to go to school wherever that rouse guy was teaching at the time it was the eastman school of music in rochester new york that's not a place that looms very large in the popular imagination about conservatories and such but music people watching know that's a pretty exclusive and elite music program i worked really really hard i wrote some good pieces and amazingly i got in i was really surprised and when i got there i epically collapsed i swear this is all relevant to the mariah carey christmas thing just bear with me i collapsed at eastman for a few reasons i was in a relatively unhealthy relationship with a young woman back in pennsylvania at the time and i was driving back to see her every weekend and that stopped me from developing a social support system at college which is a really really important thing for incoming students i learned later as a university faculty member let's see what else i was abusing substances quite heavily this is hardly uncommon for conservatory kids but mostly i think i just felt as though i didn't belong i was just not an orchestra kid i felt like an imposter toward the end of my second semester i got really messed up i was spending days days at a time locked in my dorm room peeing in bottles so that i would not risk seeing anyone or being seen by anyone on my trips to the bathroom that's a pretty messed up thing i just told you about pretty personal i tell it to you in hopes that if you're having a really rough year at school and you're doing some messed up stuff just be aware that you're not the only one and it does get better eventually i packed up and i left eastman before the school year was even over i ended up finishing my bachelor's degree back at penn state with paul and i had a really good time things went really really well i wrote some good stuff a piece that i wrote called jiahu won a prestigious student composition award from columbia university called the burns prize it's on my soundcloud you should listen to it i studied theory with a brilliant guy named julian hook and then it came time for grad school i was lucky enough to get into another really good program indiana university's jacobs school of music where dr hook had coincidentally landed as well and i had a good time but i fell into a pretty familiar pattern i really felt as though i did not belong i felt like an imposter and i was just kind of getting bored with it i was spending lots of time in my room writing these artie pop songs instead of doing the real music the music that counted in the eyes of my program and i finished all my coursework for my master's but i never graduated and it didn't matter to me because by then i had found where i did belong i had stumbled into the university's public radio station and applied for a job and i found my place within like a year i was in charge of the news at wfiu and my training in audio was kind of my secret weapon it really really helped me excel in that world i started doing lots of national stories for npr that's the nominally public public radio network that we have here in the united states a couple years later my wife and i moved to boston i got a job at wbur which is a really great npr station in boston had a great time kind of climbing the ladder there and learning a whole lot but eventually i came to the conclusion that i needed to kind of look for a different career path npr did not need any more guys of my general demographic description on their air and i was good at teaching so eventually i landed at this wonderful teaching job here in macon georgia at mercer university where i taught very happily for several years until this whole youtube thing dropped in my lap i'd always hope to find more ways to marry my disparate skill sets into the same professional activity many of the best things in the world i think are made by people who are able to bridge worlds and so when i got to georgia i started making an effort to do music or make music as part of my media projects i started writing themes for people's radio shows and podcasts for example i also started writing about music reporting on music and writing essays opinion pieces about music for general interest publications in journalism i had learned how to write things that large numbers of people would want to click on and i thought that i could combine that skill set with my musical experience to good effect or so i figured in 2014 mariah carey gave a live performance of her hit all i want for christmas is you and she infamously bombed us people were eating her alive on twitter and i wanted to come to her defense it is not realistic to expect that a woman in her mid-40s is going to sing as acrobatically as she did in her mid-20s and besides she co-wrote that song let's give her some credit that is one of the very few post-war songs that have really penetrated the christmas canon it's right in there with all of the other immortal classics and will be for a very long time and i just wanted to dig into why that is the case thus my 2014 article for slate.com all i want for christmas is diminished cords why mariah carey's immortal holiday classic sounds so darn christmassy my argument here was pretty modest i simply observed that relative to other modern christmas songs carrie's song has a harmonic palette that is more similar to something that irving berlin would have written something like white christmas it's got some spicy jazzy chords in there it's got some nice chromaticism in the melody all of which gives it a classic sound more so than other modern christmas hits and if you have no idea what any of that means what you'd like to learn consider patronizing the sponsor of this video skillshare which proves every day that the academy is hardly the only place where one can learn sophisticated stuff if you like music but know nothing about theory consider this excellent class by fernando arruda he teaches

want for christmas is you are kind of reminiscent of the great american songbook era of american popular music sort of pre-rock pop music at the same time the arrangement of the mariah song is straight out of phil spector's famous 1963 christmas album also reminds me a lot of the classic motown christmas records it's just touching or resonating with a lot of our musical christmas reference points all at the same time and yeah duh it also has sleigh bells this article really blew up for slate it was their number one most shared article for quite some time and it was again when they republished it the following year people like to read about how a song that they maybe regard as a guilty pleasure is also considered artistically meritorious by someone they find it validating and of course people with little or no musical background like it when something can help them understand why a song makes them feel the way they do so the article blew up really big and i did not get much of any blowback at the time except for this one little kind of nitpick i got in the comments where people said that what i analyzed as a minor four plus six chord in the irving berlin song the plus six wasn't really a chord tone they said it's more of a passing tone in the melody and maybe they're right although i'm pretty sure i hear it sustained in the orchestration as well although i suppose it depends on the orchestration a national radio show out of new york called the takeaway had me on to interview me about it again didn't get any blow back there to this day every christmas i get invites from chat show producers all over the world asking me to come on their show and talk about mariah carey in fact here are invites that i've gotten in the last few days one from bbc4 one from sky news to come on and do this sorry brits i'm out of the game i'm out of the carry game permanently because in the fall of 2016 i got an email from folks at vox media who wanted to do a video based on my slate piece and they wanted to interview me for it at first i was hesitant i respect vox a lot but i don't especially like it for reasons that we will get to still most people who do some version of what i do for a living believe in interview karma even now doing food journalism on youtube i live and die by people consenting to be interviewed by me so when people want to flip the table and interview me for their thing i tried to do it the vox interview was very quick they were not going to fly a crew down to macon georgia to talk to me so he did what's called a tape sink or a double ender basically that means i set up my own camera in my office at mercer and i recorded myself talking to my camera while the vox folks asked me questions over a speakerphone remember i'm a radio guy i was just starting to figure out cameras at that time and i was very distracted worrying about whether or not my dslr was running properly as they were asking me these questions and at one point in the interview i felt that i should offer or play an example of why that mariah carey song reminds me of something irving berlin would write i did not have an instrument with me in my office when i was on the takeaway i had a guitar with me but i had nothing with me in my office so i picked up my iphone and i opened up garageband that has a little keyboard in it so i picked up my phone and i started to play a particular little chord progression that is common to both all i want for christmas is u and white christmas just a tasty little bit of mode mixture goes one four minor four plus six back to one again that minor iv chord always sounded particularly christmassy to me it's that sort of melting effect going from the major four to the minor four just felt like a warm fireside especially with that spicy added six in it and as i started to play and sing this i remember making a snap decision to play and identify that minor four plus six chord not as i had done in my slate article which was as a minor four but rather as a two half diminished chord why well is because i was playing a teeny little iphone keyboard and i didn't think i would be able to finger a second without mashing the keys with my fat little fingers the notes are just too close together so i revoiced the chord i threw that added six down in the bass which then made it look like a two-half diminished chord and i called it that even though i don't think it really functions that way whatever i figured people watching a vox video are not going to stay up at night worrying about matters of enharmonic equivalence and probably neither are you if you don't know what that means basically in any system of musical analysis there's kind of multiple different names that you can give to the same collection of notes and you might give it a different name depending on kind of how it's behaving in the composition even though it's the same set of notes regardless that's what that is i want to see something crazy literally as i was recording this just now i got another twitter mention from somebody saying hey it doesn't really function as a two chord it's more of a minor iv chord this is what christmas is like for me i just know that it's the season when people show up in my mansions telling me that i'm dumb anyways also when i was playing for vox i misspoke once i said dominant when i meant subdominant and if you don't know what that means just know that that's a really elementary mistake it's pretty embarrassing on the other hand that's the kind of thing that happens i know the difference that just the wrong word came out i know the names of my own children and yet i very often refer to the big one by the little one's name and vice versa it's just that kind of mis-speaking is a thing that people do in fact i remember having the feeling that i had messed something up when i recorded that little talk through sing-through for a vox and i said i wanted to go back and do it again and i did do it again i'm pretty sure i got it right but i did not communicate effectively to the vox folks that they should probably use the second take of that anyway i had to hurry off the call with vox because i needed to go teach journalism class i sent them the files that i had recorded on my camera and then i did not hear from them again i figured that they had probably scrapped the project hardly uncommon in the business then during finals week december 2016 this happened one of my kids suffered a very terrible injury having a very young child in what is called a spika cast is an absolute nightmare it requires 24-hour care luckily christmas break had just started for me at the university so i was able to spend all of my time being a 24-hour caregiver for a very very injured little boy and it was extremely sad i was worried all the time and after a while frankly i got really really bored being hodor for a kid oh no then one day in the midst of all of that i got an email from vox saying hey we finished that video that you're in it's up why don't you go check it out and i thought oh cool i could use a pick me up i started watching this thing and my first thought wasn't oh we really botched that really it was wow that is some pretty impressive adobe after effects work i was trying to learn after effects myself at the time in general i thought it was really well done and i sent an email back saying hey great thanks for including me but then as i sat with it for a little bit longer i started to think uh people are gonna ding us for that headline the secret chord that makes christmas music so christmassy ain't nothing secret about the chord in question going to the parallel minor on the four is one of the oldest tricks in the book it in fact is a cliche and indeed i wasn't even saying that that one chord makes the song or makes the genre of christmas music i was just offering it as one example among many i think whomever wrote that headline was trying to make a cheeky leonard cohen reference if you recall leonard cohen had just died when this all happened and his immortal lyric was everywhere i heard that there was a secret chord that david played and it pleased the lord headline writers everywhere love timely illusions and i think that's what this was an attempt at though indeed the video itself did also talk about this one chord as though it is some talismanic gestalt deep within the dna of all christmas music everywhere and that did not surprise me this is vox we're talking about and that's what vox does that is their whole thing this is the one chart that explains the global economy or this is the one map that shows what's wrong with health care in the united states or whatever what's the one thing that explains all the things that's what vox does journalism i would argue is inherently reductive but vox makes an art of reducing things awesec to borrow a culinary term it means almost dry this has always been a brilliant content strategy on vox's part the one simple thing that explains all the things schtick is perfectly optimized for the platform-based content marketplace that we're in it makes things work in the context of a single tweet or other social media post so whatever i thought vox gonna vox and it's not like i'm the one calling it the secret chord that explains all of christmas music they're the ones calling it that they're not gonna blame me for this and then i looked at my twitter mentions hashtag cordgate someone had dubbed it music theory twitter was a buzz and not like a happy honeybee colony but an angry ass yellowjacket nest and their outrage was to a great extent justified i think that video was click baity and it was outright wrong in spots music theory twitter was also mad that vox hadn't called them instead no vox had called a comp major with an iphone as someone had put it you know i thought i was being rather resourceful by reaching for my phone there but anyways i've always kind of felt that music academia is a lot like high school in some ways it's got jocks it's got nerds it's got cool kids it's got losers and i kind of felt right back in there remember what i said before about how i never really felt like i fit in that world well having music theorists some of whom i knew and whose work i respected tweet at me and say literally stay in your lane that kind of touched something within me a sore spot worn raw by years and years of imposter syndrome it touched on my earlier feelings of rejection from that world and my regret about having abandoned that career path combine all that emotional baggage with the fact that i was sitting at home caring for a poor injured child and i was already emotionally really raw i had nothing to do but sit and stew about this i lost my everlove in mind i lashed out at the critics on twitter i've had trouble going back and finding a lot of these exchanges but one i remember pretty vividly was a faculty member at a very well-known music school tweeted at me and accused me of pandering to the lowest common denominator and i responded with something to the effect of okay if you think that's the lowest common denominator you have absolutely no idea how low denominators go but nothing caused me more grief than one particularly inadvisable tweet of mine somebody had tweeted hey vox you know there are actual music theory experts out there you should call us to that i replied i am an actual expert please friends allow me to revise and extend those remarks by saying i am an actual expert i absolutely was not trying to put myself on the same level as people with terminal degrees in music theory and musicology eminent music scholars who were engaged in this discussion online i was merely saying that i do have expertise too i was not just anybody and the fact is vox could have interviewed you they could have interviewed a credentialed terminal degree holding music theorist and vox still would have come away with a piece that says this is the one thing that explains all of christmas music because that's what vox does vox gonna vox regardless of who they talk to and you know what i'm still not convinced that's entirely bad i think there's value in getting a general audience to think about esoteric aesthetic stuff even if making it digestible for them requires reducing it down almost beyond the point of recognition i do think there's value there i believe in the power of expertise i believe in the academy i absolutely abhor the anti-intellectual moment that we're in here in the united states on the other hand i do think that there are lots of ways to acquire expertise beyond the normal channels and i did see some haughty elitism in the response to that video a kind of priestly attitude only we the guys in the funny hats are endowed with the divine authority to read the word of god who is this layman this lullard who would presume to interpret the mysteries of the faith and in a lot of these tweets mocking either me or the video i see a lot of very smart people doing that thing where people kind of become deliberately obtuse in their desire to be righteously indignant about something this right here is a particular version of a common argument i got people saying come on adam there's nothing inherently christmassy about these chords they're in like a billion things well duh no musical object has any intrinsic meaning in isolation context matters it always matters and you damn well know that there's nothing inherently christmassy about cinnamon and cloves either but put them on a goose the size of tiny tim and it's christmassy af likewise i do think there is a historical cultural association between the kind of harmonic palette that we see and all i want for christmas is you and the broader canon of christmas music for a lot of people vast numbers of people that time of year when their go-to country or pop station switches over to 24-hour christmas music that's really the only time in their year when they are exposed to a lot of music that isn't just for block triads christmas is the only time when they hear music from the 1930s and 40s when pop music was much more influenced by jazz and tin pan alley than by rock or folk and mariah's song evokes music of that 30s and 40s era that's all i'm trying to say all i was trying to say but in retrospect i do think i could have done a number of things differently or better in how i talked to vox and certainly in how i talked to music theory twitter if you are a kind of person who may ever be called upon to be an expert source in someone else's media project here are some hard-won lessons from me a person who is frequently on both ends of that interview dynamic both as the interviewee and the interviewer so here's what i've learned don't give any example or anecdote that you don't want to be the example or anecdote a journalist knows that they only have space to communicate one wonky idea to their audience they get one thing and everything else is going to have to be generalities so if you're an expert being interviewed you got to think really strategically about what examples or anecdotes you give them because they're probably only going to pick one to cover in any kind of detail and if there isn't one that you would want to be the one then don't give them anything don't give them any specific example or anecdote talk purely in generalities they'll hate it in journalism school we teach students that quotes should be the spice in the stew not the meat and potatoes by that we mean quotes should not be used to kind of cover basic information you can probably do that more efficiently in your own writing quotes should instead be there to provide a little bit of color a little bit of emotion a little bit of flavor for the bland bulk around it i should have known as i was singing and playing through that stupid modal interchange progression that has caused me so much grief in my life that that was gonna be the thing that they were gonna use that was the most colorful most dynamic thing that i did on camera for vox that day of course they were going to use it maybe i shouldn't have submitted to that interview at all after all remember i had already written my article i had already said my say my thing was out there in my own words why did i need to have it translated through someone else because here's another unfortunate thing about journalism it's sloppy inherently sloppy in fact i would argue that the only difference between journalism and scholarship is that scholarship is slow and methodical while journalism is quick and dirty it is the first draft of history as the expression goes i believe that both journalism and scholarship have really important roles to play in society but they are fundamentally different and they both have their pros and cons here's another unfortunate thing about journalism is that you often have a person who has no particular subject matter expertise covering a really complex topic and there are some advantages to that there's advantage to having a layperson cover something that's really really complicated they're coming at it with fresh eyes and they're coming at it asking the kinds of basic questions that the normals at home are going to be wondering that's a good thing but of course there's a downside to it too which is that the details are going to get smudged a little bit around the edges one thing you can do is ask the reporter you're talking to if you could maybe see their draft prior to publication you'll have to do this delicately because this what is known as giving a source prior review is generally regarded as an ethical no-no in the journalism world it gives a source the opportunity to exert undue influence over your finished product they're taught not to do this but here's the thing you're not some politician you're not a newsmaker with a big personal stake in influencing how this topic gets talked about you're an expert source you're just somebody who's trying to inform the public the same way that the journalist is and in my opinion granting prior review to an expert source is a very different thing and a perfectly fine thing in fact when i blew up on youtube and then started doing food journalism alongside my recipe videos i realized that i could now make my own ethical rules and i started granting prior review to every single expert source that i talked to i still do that to this day i'm not offering them veto power over my video but i am offering them every opportunity to convince me if i've gotten something wrong and in fact i get things wrong all the time and prior review has saved me from a lot of those errors i believe in it if vox had given me prior review i don't think i would have torn their thing to shreds i still think they did a pretty good job overall i just would have encouraged them to kind of walk back from certain rather kind of absolutist or sweeping language they used and i might have discouraged them from using certain quotes that they had taken from me here maybe some good ways to ask for prior review hey i'd love to have a look at your draft when you got it together just to make sure that i didn't do a bad job explaining any of the technical stuff blame it on yourself that always works don't worry i'm not trying to write your article for you and feel free to call or text me about it anytime day or night i can probably look at it real quick right before your deadline journalists are always on deadline and that's part of why they don't want to go into the prior review business it just slows things down you could try asking for prior review that might work however if you really want to try to communicate sophisticated things from your field to a general audience really the best thing may be for you to simply do it yourself to augment your skill set with the ability to take esoterica and translate it into an article or a video that lots of normal people will want to watch there's certainly a lot of models lord knows adam neely here on youtube offers a great example of how to do that so does 12 tone here on youtube check out that channel in fact corey from 12tone was actually with me a couple years back at a music theory conference where i first delivered the paper that i just adapted just now for you i was at the university of south carolina and i want to thank dr danny jenkins there for inviting me to do that and for encouraging me to write about this experience and thank you mariah carey you're blameless in all of this mimi you are merely an innocent bystander you're simply an accessory to good holiday cheer and long may you reign as the new queen of christmas,3

***RECIPE, MAKES 4 DOZEN COOKIES***...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.187352, here's a basic all you need to know primer on making christmas sugar cookies the kind you roll out cut into shapes and decorate with a thin icing that's really a glaze it sets up hard i love this tradition i'm pretty sure i've done this every year that i've been alive there's tons of great roll out sugar cookie recipes they nearly all work but the one i'm using is from my wife's grandmother grandma sherstrom see make every year she's left us no alternative i've only slightly tweaked her recipe the big thing i did is cut it in half be careful lots of heirloom holiday baking recipes were written in the days when people were more likely to have huge families i cut this in half and it still makes four dozen cookies pretty much any sugar cookie dough will start with a softened butter if your butter is cold you can soften it in the microwave i've got a stick and a half that's six ounces 170 grams drop the power to low then just nuke it for 10 or 15 seconds at a time reach in and rotate another 10 seconds or so reach in and rotate if you didn't stop and rotate part of the butter might melt while the other side is still cold there we are soft but not melted into a big mixing bowl gotta have soft butter to beat in sugar a cup and a half of granulated sugar 300 grams a cheap electric hand mixer makes baking so much easier and i think i prefer them to expensive stand mixers for most things because they give you more control you can move around and get in the corner i see a lot of people on the internet complaining that their sugar cookies come out too fluffy and cakey you might be creaming too much air into the butter at this stage i really just bring them together before beating in two eggs until smooth grandma surestrom actually beats the eggs into the butter before she puts in the sugar i think that's another way to keep the batter from getting too fluffy for rollout cookies i put in a lot of vanilla at least a tablespoon some people prefer to put it in the icing but that darkens the color makes the icing less white if you don't put in vanilla or almond extract or something into the batter you should probably put in a tablespoon of milk or water just to get enough moisture i love enough salt in the cookies to be noticeably salty it's a great contrast against the sugar icing i'm doing half a teaspoon of morton kosher like three grams i've got salted butter in there already if it was unsalted butter i'd put twice as much salt in baking powder two teaspoons eight grams people say you gotta mix this and the salt into the flour first you absolutely do not have to do that not for cookies makes no difference the all-purpose flour you wanna mix in a little at a time i'm starting with a cup gonna do about three cups total maybe 360 grams if you tried to mix it in all at once it would just explode everywhere three batches is good in my opinion the cookies are best when the batter is very dry lots of flour in there that's still quite sticky in this kind of cookie a really sticky batter tends to make a very thin crispy cookie i want one that's a little taller and more crumbly plus the edges come out cleaner with a drier dough they spread more if the dough is soft i also want a cookie that's a little under sweet so that it works in harmony with the glaze which is solid sugar all this adds up to put in a lot of flour i'm just mixing in flour until it's hardly sticky at all you don't want to go too far though because if the batter is super dry it'll crack a lot as you try to roll it out that feels perfect right there just barely sticky now the essential step the batter has to be cold when you roll it i'll chill it in the fridge for at least an hour during which time i can sit by the tree and enjoy a cup from the sponsor of this video trade coffee trade is a way to discover amazing new coffees from the best roasters you go online and take a quiz where

simple shapes complex ones like this darn snowflake are much harder to punch out they're more delicate and their edges tend to get overcooked you'll see simple shapes are better i switched from metal to plastic a few years ago and never looked back the metal ones always rust on me probably in part because i only use them once a year the rest of the time they sit in a humid cabinet baking sheets you'll want as many as you can fit in your oven at a time you don't have to use parchment paper but i highly recommend it it makes sticking impossible and cleanup easier and i recommend getting the kind that come pre-cut into single sheets like this super convenient compared to the one big roll that you have to cut with scissors rolling pin a wine bottle works if you don't have one i recommend having a spatula handy to scrape the unbaked cookies off your rolling surface if they stick and to keep them from sticking you'll need some kind of edible powder i'm using powdered sugar you could just use flour i honestly don't think it makes a big difference either way and i absolutely think this is one of those times to just work directly on the countertop you need a lot of space and if you have a stone counter that's perfect stone helps keep the batter from warming up too fast and i recommend working with the dough straight out of the fridge it might feel too cold to roll too brittle but just be patient roll it a little turn it roll it a little turn it have faith it will start to spread just be gentle turning helps you get it to spread evenly in all directions and it keeps the bottom from sticking to the counter as you turn you release it and you sweep fresh powder around the underside it doesn't matter at all if the edges crack up because we're punching out little shapes we're not using the whole sheet as is i'm shooting for two or three millimeters thick it doesn't have to be precise i like to have some thinner cookies that are a little crispier and some thicker ones that are a little chewier it's all good the secret to punching them out push straight down hard then keep pushing as you twist a little bit the twisting pulls the cookie away from the scrap and releases its bottom from the countertop whoops there you go if possible the easier thing to do is to use the cutter to simply lift the cookie over to the pan they won't spread very much when they bake so you can position them pretty close you do want to punch out with maximum geometric efficiency to minimize waste you can gather up the trimmings and roll it out again but the cookies from the second rolling will never be as tender as those from the first i try to select shapes that'll fit nicely within the natural contours of the rolled dough lauren is gonna do a few and there she didn't twist the cutter with that snowflake so it's stuck to the counter the spatula works great though and you'll need it more and more as the dough warms up and therefore gets softer and stickier everything is easier if you work fast but best laid plans go out the window once tiny hands get involved that's fine this is christmas cookies it's not a special forces operation like i said you can put them pretty close on the pan they'll only spread a millimeter or so okay so here's all my trimmings i can gather those up but if i tried to roll out and punch some more cookies now look what happens the dough is too warm too soft and sticky just throw it in the freezer for five or ten minutes and then you can start again these cookies really will be fine their texture will just be a little harder than the first ones okay time to bake a convection bake setting was made for a job like this that fan will circulate the air and make sure that all the pans bake reasonably evenly i'm doing 350 fahrenheit 180c convection if you don't have a fan i'd do 375 fahrenheit and you'll need to rotate the pans halfway through so they cook evenly though look even with the fan after about 18 minutes i can see the bottom tray is done prematurely it's hotter down there apparently out it comes and that snowflake got overdone complex shapes have more edge relative to their total mass which means the edges are likely to get too hot not a fan i basically look for the very first signs of browning when i see the edges just starting to turn the cookies are done out they come that kind of crackly surface on them is from the powdered sugar by the way if you don't like it roll with flour but it's all going to get covered in icing after we let these cooled all the way down you got to let them cool to do really fancy decorating you'd probably want a royal icing made with egg whites i just do the simplest thing which is a giant mountain of powdered sugar and just enough milk to dissolve it into a glaze water would be fine you'll be shocked at how little moisture it takes just a glug of milk and you can always add more sugar or more milk if it's too thick or too thin if you want a super shiny look on the dried cookie you can put in a big squeeze of corn syrup but that also softens the texture a bit i prefer the glazed crispy when dried that's perfect right there half of that goes into a big bowl and the other half i'll divide into little bowls so that i can make different colors be careful about putting in too much food coloring that's actually enough added moisture to make this too loose i needed to mix in more powdered sugar plus the color will darken as the cookie dries i totally put in too much blue i'll make this one green still needs a little more sugar glazes are very sensitive to moisture don't expect any advanced decorating tips here i will only say that it's easier if you could just dip the cookie into your base coat of icing that gets you nice clean edges that way and you can drizzle over another color and have a ton of fun with a toothpick you can certainly just paint on the icing with a butter knife if you'd rather do that and if you're going to use sprinkles you can control their flow much better if you just tap the bottle tap tap tap that's as fancy as i get because honestly once the aforementioned tiny hands get involved this descends into pure chaos as nature intended oh you can't eat it you gotta decorate it first can i just lick this off [Music] if you set these aside the icing will harden by morning and the cookie will soften a little bit as it sucks in moisture from the air this is far and away my favorite part of christmas if i can do this with my grandkids one day i will consider my life a win even though the aftermath is always a staggering mess but you can eat the remnants as you clean and you know what goes great with cookies remember to get 30 off your first bag of coffee from trade with my link in the description and have a merry christmas if that's your thing,3
Why the turkey is named after Turkey (and India),https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y2XZiREio4I/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLAg5LCt9tMNzXlGNzJ56r8wFMyMHA,y2XZiREio4I,"12 minutes, 43 seconds","Thanks to Surfshark for sponsoring this video!

Thanks to...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.187352, it is not a coincidence that this bird often consumed at winter holiday feasts shares its name with the land of the turks the turkey is named after turkey at first blush this makes no sense at all because the turkey both in its wild and domestic forms is indigenous to here the americas not to eurasia the world beyond the americas only obtained this bird relatively recently via the colombian exchange but that fact actually explains why the turkey is called the turkey or the hindi or the indic or the peru there's all just different people trying to identify this delicious new character who had suddenly appeared in their lives and they were doing it by either comparing it to similar birds they already knew or by naming it after the places from which or the people from whom they most directly obtained it and by that standard i could call this bird the wopi because i got footage of her at wopi farm here in kathleen georgia my name's farmer mark iwobi is a lakota sioux word and it translates into hope speaking of indigenous americans what did they call the turkey i mean if anybody gets to have an authoritative opinion on the subject it's them right this bird was domesticated in the central areas of mexico mainly oaxaca 2 000 years ago i asked my delightfully international followers over on tick tock to duet me and to tell me what they call this bird so this guy it's called guajolote in in mexico and the word comes from the nagato language where charlotte which little means the old monster just looking at it the name fits right old monster or beast or sometimes it's translated as great monster great beast guajalote that's what the aztecs called it or at least guajalote is the spanish colonists version of the indigenous word that was something more like this i'm not even gonna try to say it but the spaniards did come up with their own name for this bird and that name is naturally still around in mexico hi i'm christy i'm from mexico and we call this pavo that's a romance word that potentially goes back to ancient greek and it literally means peacock peacocks of course are different species originally from south asia but you can see why the conquistadors were reminded of peacocks when they first laid eyes on a guajalote especially a male one these are male northern wild turkeys displaying their impressive tail fans in a behavior known as strutting turkeys peacocks chickens quails grouse all those fat little bowling ball shaped birds that live down on the ground and don't swim or fly too good are known collectively to scientists as galiforms and they all have common ancestors going back to the time of the dinosaurs like before pangaea had broken apart and the americas even became a distinct continent that's how far back these animals go so european explorers and colonists were not wrong when they compared the new galiformes they encountered here in the americas with the ones they were already familiar with from back home a turkey is like a peacock because they are distantly related and a similar such comparison probably explains how this bird came to be known in english as a turkey it reminded the english of another member of the galiforms order known as a guinea fowl guinea fowl are all over eurasia but they're generally considered to be native to africa hence the name guinea is what europeans called west africa and farmer mark actually has a couple of guinea fowl running around wopi farm not because he wants to eat them but because of what they eat so the guinea fowl are great for parasites and ticks and fleas and all that sort of all those sort of bugs that cause problems here on a farm a guinea fowl can eat a pounds of ticks in a single day pretty neat but lots of other people totally eat guinea fowl and their tasty little eggs too as the culinary historian andrew f smith writes in this excellent 2006 book of his guinea fowl was popularized in western europe shortly before the colombian exchange in the 14th and 15th centuries prior to that rich europeans had eaten a lot of peacock but peacocks were apparently difficult to raise and purportedly difficult to digest guinea fowl were tastier and easier to raise the spanish called them pavo ii and they were brought to western europe quote by arab or turkish traders or perhaps portuguese explorers of west africa we don't know for sure but we do know that turkish traders definitely sailed up to western europe into england and sold all kinds of fabulous things from far away to the point where the english for example referred to anything exotic or unusual as being turkish or turkey turkey in this context being an adjective describing things of or related to the turks and if you trot the globe like a 15th

description thank you surf shark so as we were saying in tutor england they referred to all kinds of exotic things as turkey because they got all kinds of wonderful things from far away via turkish merchants and then right here in the oxford english dictionary we can see the terms turkey and turkey hen showing up in the written record in the 16th century  and hen being english words for a male and female galanacious bird respectively there is scholarly disagreement about how this all shook out but from what i can read the dominant expert view seems to be that the term turkey originally applied to guinea fowl first and then it was applied to these birds from the americas either because they reminded europeans of guinea fowl or because europeans confused them with guinea fowl or because many europeans would have bought their first turkey from a turkish merchant because the turkish merchants always had the hot new from far away it's probably a mixture of all of the above right andrew smith for example notes that the swiss scientist conrad gessner wrote in 1555 that the turkey and the guinea fowl are identical which suggests that he had not seen a turkey at the time i should tell you that there is a totally different explanation as to where the english word turkey comes from as it applies to a bird an alternate theory that points out that tuki is a hebrew word in the torah that's used to describe peacock tuki became turkey this is an explanation that was offered by the italian-american linguist mario pay in this 1964 book of his but scholars now widely viewed this hebrew link as apocryphal it's just a coincidence indeed right before he died in the 70s pay gave an interview to the science journalist robert kralwich where he reversed himself at the end of his life pay concluded that the english called it a turkey either because they got it from the turks or because it reminded them of something one would get from the turks an excerpt from crawlwich's radio piece about this they would consider an indian thing and a turkish thing as being about the same sort of thing so if a strange new bird shows up from some far away country it was only natural to call it a turkey because turkey means far away and speaking of india guess what the turks call a turkey i adam i'm sheriff from turkey we call turkey hindi turkish which related with sinstan which means india hindi the turks call this an indian bird a hindi so do the french by the way this became the modern french word dond in poland they named the turkey after india so did the dutch hen from calcun is what this means after the indian city calcu the dutch eventually just started calling the bird a calcoon and then they exported that name for the bird all over the world for example to their colony in indonesia hi i am feni and in indonesia we call turkey so why did all of these people think this bird came from india when it very much did not come from india it came from mexico well smith writes about a number of possibilities in his book it may have been because christopher columbus referred to the americas as the indies he thought it was india at first and the name stuck the west indies problem with that theory is that india  or chicken of india were already terms used in europe prior to the colombian exchange probably used to describe things like guinea fowl we do know that the portuguese established guinea fowl and turkeys in their colonies in india as a result smith reckons the italians associated guinea fowl with india or maybe just because europeans in general considered anything exotic as being from india but regardless the turks may have gotten their guinea fowl first from the italians so the turks called the guinea fowl a hindi and later called the turkey a hindi because it was a lot like a guinea fowl as you can gather it's one big murky turkey mess but those are all of the elements kind of floating around in the stew that may have been influencing each other in one direction or another to give us the poultry nomenclature that we have globally today which is not to say that there aren't even more names for this damn bird the portuguese call it a peru a lot of people think that comes from the name of the south american nation peru which is at least a little closer to where the freaking bird actually originated but no andrew smith is not alone among scholars and arguing that peru is simply a portuguese corruption of the spanish word pavo which you'll remember means peacock here's one particularly polyglotic viewer of mine on tick tock who gives us not one not two but three names for this bird my name is erin and i'm from jakarta but my family is from guangdong so turkey and old fashioned which is my mother's tongue is means fire and kai means chicken so and in mandarin it's called puerti o means fire and tea means chicken and i know in malay himalay it's i am blande ayam means chicken and blanda means dutch or the netherlands and basically it means touch chicken now something much less confusing than the naming of the bird is why it is so globally popular this to me is very clear they're just so meaty especially compared to other birds if you saw my recent christmas goose recipe you might have been shocked as i was at how small the breasts were when i cut them off whole compare that to a turkey breast now admittedly the modern broad-breasted white turkey breed has a freakishly huge breast compared to its ancestors today's commercial breed was created in the mid 20th century by crossing the bronze turkey with the white holland turkey that's what farmer mark has a white holland he also has a rare chocolate turkey breed uh it doesn't mean that the the meat is brown or anything like that it's on the inside as a normal normal looking bird none of these heritage breeds are as freakishly meaty as the modern breed but they're still freakishly meaty compared to other birds they're big ol meatballs on legs and i think that explains why they have spread so far as to be given a hundred different names whatever you call it i hope that you are as grateful for it as i am this season,3

I'm not sure I've ever eaten it before. I ordered one off the internet and I'm gonna
show you what I did with it. It came out real good. So here it is thawed. It's 10-12 pounds, around
6 kilos. It'll serve 6-7 people, fewer than you'd think, because like all water fowl,
a huge amount of this mass is fat — delicious, delicious fat that helps the bird stay buoyant
in the water. Almost all of the fat is gonna melt out in the cooking, shrinking the whole
roast quite a bit. But that's fine — we'll use that fat to
cook our sides. In the cavity here, there's a bunch of huge chunks of fat. You could just
throw those away, but I'm gonna leave them in the roasting pan to render. Here's the the neck, and yeah, it's a goose,
so here's the rest of the neck. I'll just leave that in the pan for the gravy. Here's
the bag with the giblets — the heart, gizzard, liver — again, all great stuff for the gravy. It's starting to look like a trauma ward there,

skin is way easier if you have a freshly sharpened knife. Highly recommend. Then I'll just lift
her up so I can start all the way down on the bottom, and shallow cut all the way across,
just through the skin and fat layer. Then parallel cuts all the way across. People always say, ""Be super careful you don't
cut past the fat and into the meat,"" but I mean, what's really bad about that? You don't
want to cut the meat to ribbons, of course, but if you nick the flesh a little bit I don't
think it really matters. Now, when I get down to where the legs and
thighs are, I'm just rolling the bird over so I can get the skin that's over the thigh
meat there. Alright, I wanna criss-cross-apple-sauce this bird, so I'll just rotate and repeat.
You get nice little diamonds this way. Some people say scoring allows more fat to
render out. I'm not convinced it makes a big difference in that respect. What I do know
is that it makes a noticeably tastier crust. Lots more surface area that'll go crisp and
caramelized, and into which we can rub a lot of classic Christmas spices. I've got some cinnamon, ground ginger, a little
nutmeg and cloves. A few big pinches of salt and I'll rub that all in. Look at how the
scored surface just drinks in all that spice. Flip it around and do the same to the other
side. A lot of this seasoning is gonna dissolve into the gravy, and that's just fine. Get
it breast-side up again. Ah, not the blue light! Not the blue light!
That's the surgery light! The yellow light, the yellow light! Whew, that's better. No, I'm not roasting this up on a rack, you'll
see why. And I'm putting it into a cold oven. Fat starts rendering at a much lower temperature
than that at which meat cooks, so if we let this heat up slowly we'll be giving the fat
a head start. I'll put my thermometer probe into the deepest part of the breast and that's
it. Nice, gentle roasting at 300 F, 150 C. This
first phase will take maybe 45 minutes. During which time I can get a big pot of water and
par-boil my potatoes. I've got three pounds or 1.36 kilos of small potatoes. I'm a sucker
for the multi-color packs. You could cut bigger potatoes into nice big
chunks, but little potatoes work better for how I'm gonna roast them. Roast potatoes of
all kinds come out so much fluffier and crispier if you boil them first, maybe 20 minutes for
these — until they're just getting fork-tender. Here's my goose after about 45 minutes, and
wow, look at all the fat that has already rendered out. The breast meat is approaching
140 F, 60 C, which I'm gonna say is done. It's quite common for people to consider the
breast of water fowl a red meat, and to cook it pink. The breast of a bird powers its wings. Ducks
and geese are long-distance flyers, so their breast meat is full of myoglobin and slow-twitch
muscle fibers, giving it a texture and appearance more like, say, beef. That's why a lot of
people cook duck breast medium rare. It won't have that slimy, gelatinous texture that chicken
breast has when it's rare. I'm just finding the breast-bone with my knife
and then slicing down along it to shave off the entire side of the breast. It is done
roasting. I'll just stow it on some foil for now. Is this meat going to be potentially hazardous,
like rare chicken? That is a subject of some debate. The U.S. Department of Agriculture
says any bird you gotta cook to 165 F. But fine restaurants all over the world serve
pink duck breast every single day. I will simply say that I would not serve this
to an immunocompromised person, or anyone very old or very young. But for myself, with
a really high-quality bird, I'm willing to take what I regard as a minor risk. I'll just wrap those up and set them aside
for now. The legs and thighs of a waterfowl are just
like a chicken's, in that most people think they taste best when cooked more thoroughly.
So I've just flipped the bird over. I've got its leg bones hanging over the side to hold
it steady — keep it from tipping over. Now all the dark meat is up out of the pan where
it can get some nice dry heat and crisp up. Probe in the deepest part of the thigh. Oh, my potatoes are just fork tender, so I'll
go ahead and drain those, get a sheet pan and then lay out all the potatoes. It's time
to start frying these in delicious goose fat. I'll just get a ladle full and start slathering
it on. I want a very thick coating of grease, everywhere. That's what makes crispy roast
potatoes. I'll season these with some pepper and a lot
of salt, smush them around. This works great with olive oil instead, by the way. In those
go to the oven, and back in goes the goose. Time to up the temperature to maybe 400 F,
200 C. I'm done being gentle. It's time to get some deep, dark roasted flavor. After
maybe another 45 minutes, here we are. That smells so Christmassy. Skin is looking really crisp, and the thigh
is coming up on 175 F, 80 C, which I consider the minimum for poultry leg quarters. This
meat is very forgiving, unlike the breast. You can get away with ""over-cooking"" it. Out it comes to the board to rest. Let's check
the potatoes real quick. Looking good. Nice brown color on the bottoms there, and you
could keep roasting them just like this. But I'm gonna do the trick where you take a heavy
glass or something and just crush each potato a little bit. Just push it until you feel
the skin pop, then stop. If you keep pushing, the potato will fall apart. But you just pop them, they'll stay together
and you'll expose a lot of this fully starchy flesh that will crisp beautifully in the fat. If we'd tried this step before we roasted
them a bit they might not have been soft enough, and they might not have all fit on one pan.
The roasting has shrunk them a bit, and it'll shrink them some more, so don't stress if
your pan is a little crowded. Just as long as everything is in one layer. Back in the
oven those go. Time to make our gravy with all the stuff
in this pan. First we gotta take out almost all the fat. There is just so much of it.
And you can freeze it and save it for roasting other things down the road. Delicious. I'm trying to leave all the solids behind
for my gravy, so I'm tilting the pan so that the buoyant fat floats up and over into my
ladle, and now I've basically evacuated all the grease I can. I will use what remains
to make a roux to thicken my gravy. Heat goes on medium under the roasting tray,
and I'll start stirring in flour, enough to give me a loose paste. I'm not using a whisk.
It's fine if I get some flour lumps because I'm gonna strain this all in the end. I'll just fry that roux until I can see and
smell it starting to brown. The raw flour taste is now gone, and it's time to deglaze
the pan. I am using a 1 quart bottle, almost a liter, of black cherry juice. Waterfowl go great with sweet, fruity sauces.
You could use any kind of juice or wine you want. I'm just stirring the whole bottle into
my roux gradually, and especially focusing on parts of the pan like that, where there's
fond that's on the verge of burning. Just get it wet and then scrape it off the pan. Once I've got all that in, I'm gonna switch
over to chicken stock. I ended up putting in the whole 1-quart carton. Now I'll just
reduce the heat a bit and let this simmer — the longer the better to extract flavor
our of the giblets and everything in there. Since it's gonna be pretty sweet from all
that juice, I'm gonna balance that with some heat. A big pinch of dried chili flakes. Let's check on the potatoes. Looking nice,
and now it's time to flip every singe one of them, so that both sides can go dark and
golden and crispy. When the potatoes are roasted, it's gonna be time to eat. They can't sit
around for a long time or they'll go soggy. If you want an easier potato side, by the
way, just make mashed potatoes and stir in goose fat instead of butter. I'll give the gravy a stir, just to make sure
nothing is sticking to the bottom and burning. And it's time disassemble the rest of the
goose. I'll just cut the skin connecting the leg quarter to the body, dislocate the hip
joints and then just pull off the leg quarters. Don't freak out if you see red. This isn't
a chicken or a turkey. Water birds have way more pink myoglobin in the muscles. With a
turkey I can usually just tear the legs off, but with this I really needed to get in with
my knife and cut down through the hip joint to get those off. There we go. Leg attached to the thigh, there.
There's a few more bits of meat on this carcass you can fight for. Just feel around with your
fingers and pull off anything you might want to eat. I'll got off the wings. There's a
little good meat there. And now, this you can throw in the fridge
or the freezer for making soup or stock another day. Time to separate the leg and thigh. I'll just
cut between them through that skin and then lever this apart to expose the knee joint.
Again, don't be freaked out by pink. This is not a chicken and we're actually not done
cooking it. I'll just trim some blubbery bits of fat still
hanging off those thighs, and that's it. With the wings, only the drumette really has enough
meat for you to gnaw on. The rest can go in the stock pot. Let's check on the gravy. Give it a taste.
Needs a lot of pepper and salt. Mix that in, and I would err on the side of reducing this
too thick, because you can always water it down right before you eat. Strainer goes into
a bowl, and then I'll dump everything in. I took the neck out before I did this. Too
big for the sieve. And once everything is in there, I'll just
grind away at it with my wooden spoon until the gravy has passed through and only the
giblets and such remain. You can either toss these, or chop them up into little bits and
return them to the gravy. There we go — nice thick, smooth gravy. I'll set that aside somewhere
it can keep warm. Here's all of our keeper meat. Quite tasty,
but the breasts especially are cold and soggy. We shall fix both problems right before we
eat by grabbing a very wide pan, and heating a ladle of our rendered goose fat over like
medium high heat. Then, in goes the breasts, skin-side down. This will crisp up the skin and re-heat the
meat. Look at that. I'll flip them, again, just for a minute to re-heat the interior.
I don't want cook the inside any further. Out they come and back to the cutting board.
Then in goes the thighs and all the other meat, skin-side down to crisp up and re-heat
everything. That really, really smells good. Out everything comes, and into the remaining
goose fat and fond I will dump a 1-pound bag of pre-washed and chopped greens. This kind
of product is an absolute life-saver when assembling something large and complicated
like Christmas dinner. If it doesn't all fit, just stir it around
until it wilts and then you can fit more in. These are mustard greens, which are probably
by favorite dark, leafy green. They have a nutty flavor I love. I'll pour in a little water to help deglaze
the pan and get the greens started cooking. It just takes a minute for them all to wilt
down, and then I'll give them a taste. These needs more pepper and salt, and then maybe
another little ladle of goose grease. I would normally summon the upside-down bear
and squeeze in some honey to balance the bitterness of greens, but we're having this with our
black cherry gravy, which is sweet. So, all done. Off the heat, but leave them in the pan to
stay warm. The potatoes have gotten at least 90 minutes
in the oven and they look great. Last thing I'll do is take a bunch of sage and then tear
in whole leaves. You could chop it up fine. But they'll fry a little bit in that hot fat
and wilt a lot. Sage is such a great winter holiday flavor,
but it's very strong. Be careful, if you're not sure if you like it. Now we can finally cut our goose beast up
into nice thin slices. Look at that pink color, and the scored skin is so crispy. Some potatoes
on the plate. Some greens, some slices of breast, and then maybe a leg with that. Time to drizzle on that sweet-and-a-little
sour gravy, and we can finally taste. Again, this is my first time having goose. I've had
tons of duck. This is gamier than duck, which I really like. Strong flavor. It is surprisingly
tougher than duck, which I don't really like, though the leg and thigh meat is softer, because
we cooked it so thoroughly. I actually wish I'd cooked the legs a little longer. Those potatoes are just insane. If you haven't
had potatoes thoroughly roasted in duck or goose fat, you're in for something very special.
Those greens are shockingly good, especially with a little bit of the sweet gravy on them. And the crust of Christmas spices on that
meat is festive AF, which I believe is how Tiny Tim put it, right? And let us raise our glasses to the ""founder

Thanks to everybody on Instagram who submitted...",2022-12-01 14:47:05.187352, this video is sponsored by curology what is the strangest food you've eaten probably sweet breads which is the the thymus gland um and the thing that's kind of silly about those is that like when well prepared they just taste like a chicken nugget or the inside of a chicken nugget so i would just say instead of paying a lot of money at a fancy restaurant for sweetbreads just eat chicken nuggets hello welcome to ask adam number seven i'm here with my lovely wife lauren over there who is going to be putting your questions to me thank you to everybody on instagram for asking them shall we have another well i have my coffee what's your favorite english or british food oh so many um you know it's probably got to be a shepherd's pie right i mean is there is there any better cold weather meal i don't think so um and it's got to be i mean and i love lamb too i love all all sheep products with the exception of wool well do you wear anything with wool why do people use wool for clothing very very warm i know but it's so scratchy and you can get warm cotton things you wear something under it all right i'd rather eat the sheep than wear it so that's great but there's so many great things i mean i love i love like a traditional full english breakfast i think although a lot of that might just be that i love the roasted tomato because there aren't a lot of contexts in which you get served just a plain roasted tomato just to eat not to be had as a sauce or you know something like an ingredient and something else just a plain roast tomato like a plain roast tomato is incredibly delicious uh you know you gotta love bangers and mash you gotta love toad and whole um yeah so many so many great foods i love mushy peas mushy peas yeah when you get them with fish and chips and you run the french fries through the mushy peas oh so good the chips through the mushy peas sorry yeah there you go um a chip buddy you ever heard of one of those a chip buddy they take uh they take like white bread and they smear like butter on it and then they just put french fries on it and then another piece of bread with butter on it and they eat that that sounds delicious i mean it's an interesting question like why why why do the brits have this reputation of having kind of nasty or at least kind of uninspired food and that's probably a topic for an entire video but it's like multifaceted and probably the most immediate reason for it is just like post-war scarcity and austerity or you know mid-war which is where like a lot of a lot of that kind of stuff comes from but like i love that stuff it's amazing um the other thing that i love is the sponsor of this video thanks to curology the sponsor of this video uh my skin have you noticed my skin you're radiant i'm glowing i'm glowing so if you have skin problems you have like blemishes or breakouts or you're getting fine lines like i am given that i'm barreling toward 40. curology is something that you might want to look into curology is not like witch doctory it's actual medicine this was prescribed to me by their team of dermatological professionals i just went on their website and i took a little skin quiz that much yeah that's fine lauren is a skin care maven and i have never done any kind of skin care before i am

two two and then you get the cleanser and the moisturizer kind of pat it into your face no like press it press and the reason that i'm doing this is not because like i have like lots of zits like i'm an old man i don't get zits okay first of all a lot of people barreling towards 40 are still dealing with breakouts we can't all have lovely italian skin like you do olive the skin straight from the olive groves um that said like you know i may be the reason that i'm sort of you're you're getting me to pay attention to skin care part of that is that like i don't know i have to like look at my dumb face in the camera all the time and i am noticing that i'm getting older and that i have like worry lines in my forehead and stuff like that and this kind of treatment can uh you know slow some of the inevitable aging effects i mean i want to age gracefully right but i also don't want to look like a leather bag then you better start wearing sunscreen on your face yes yes sunscreen sunscreen very important so you just do this every night before you go to bed you do the cleanser and then you put on the medicine and then you put on the moisturizer and that's it and hopefully this will help me maintain my youthful mediterranean glow for years to come so that the kids on the internet won't think that they're too cool for me i think they'll still think they're too cool for me for you and potentially they are but that's okay they definitely are um so just hit the link in the description and you can get that free 30-day supply of curology you just pay the 4.95 for shipping and handling and you got to like fill out the quiz and send a picture of your skin so they can prescribe the right thing to you but hit that link and get that trial and i highly recommend it thank you curology why are there so few prominent women chefs in the food tube sphere wow um so that's a big question and i think we can kind of talk about lots of parts of it it has to be acknowledged up front that like i'm part of that problem right um i am taking up space that could be occupied on this platform by someone who isn't another one of me right and i was pretty conscious of that when i was working in traditional media that like i was you know the the outlets that i was working for did not need another one of me and that was kind of part of the reason why i sort of like ditched that sort of normal path of advancement and started teaching and then kind of randomly fell into this so i have tried in my capacity here to highlight creators female creators who are you know not exactly like me who i i think that you should go and watch i've talked about helen rennie a lot um i've talked about fatima's kitchen on tiktok which is like if there's any you know if there's any social media food person whose food i actually want to eat it's fatima's kitchen on tick tock gotta check her out i'll put the link in the description um so i've tried to do that but i actually i think that there are some other reasons why you know sort of a lot of the top food youtubers are just you know dudes like me um one is is you like to a great extent you're the problem i think which is to say that like being a youtuber or being a food a tick-tocker or anything like that like involves um getting a lot of horrible comments and harassment and just just soul-crushing things that people say to you and when it's about you know it's bad enough for like me a grown-ass man but like a woman a young woman i can only imagine the terror of of that and i i would think that that would be a big disincentive to a lot of young women especially from getting into this just the creepiness alone let alone the like abuse well and the abuse you get is different than the abuse that women get i mean women's abuse is sexualized and frightening and targeted in a way that like people will come into your comment section and say you're stupid or you know they'll be like you're gay or whatever and it's just like grow up but um with women it's it's a lot more frightening and it's i mean frankly it's the reason why i'm sitting off camera right now like i i'm a grown-up and i can shake it off but also i don't want to have to shake it off so i just avoid it um that's how i cope and that makes me happy yeah so that's one way in which it's your fault in my opinion um let me be clear not you the question asker whose username is now on the screen well maybe that person is a horrible troll we don't know no i don't think so i think you know i think they're asking in good faith and i think it's a valid question i'm sorry i need some salt for my coffee it's amazing how effective uh salt is at knocking the bitter notes off of black coffee you should try it a little pinch um so another way in which i think it's you know all our our our collective fault is that we have to remember that like if youtube isn't surfacing the kind of content that you want to see um it's not like the kind of old days of traditional media where like you can blame some cigar chomping executives who are you know making decisions about who we should put on prime time television and like you know you can blame them for making what you believe are the wrong decisions um you know something like youtube the algorithm tm you know we don't we don't understand it and all of its mysteries but like the one thing that youtube will tell you and that i think is self-evidently true is that it is chiefly just a feedback loop i lost my microphone the algorithm tm is a feedback loop whatever people watch gets watched more because the algorithm basically just sort of causes the snowballing effect so more views mean more of the algorithm picking it up and putting it in front of other people's eyeballs right so if you don't watch it youtube is not going to surface it for other people so that's not just if you want to see more female food creators or any anything right it's it's about what you watch and in that sense i think that all of us need to you know shoulder more responsibility for what gets surfaced and doesn't it's deeply about our demonstrated preferences and if you're looking for more female you know food youtube creators go google top female food you know top women on food youtube somebody has curated that list for you go follow them and watch them and then youtube will serve you more and i'm you know i'm linking some of my favorites in the description here the last factor that i will discuss that is much more directly self-critical is that it's like it does take a certain male typically male audacity to presume that you should be making instructional content for other people right a certain thing that like men at least in you know sort of western civilization are in are conditioned to feel entitled to the notion that they know things that other people need to know and i'm certainly a part of that phenomenon um and yeah and that's not a good thing i don't think i mean every well i don't know what do you think save me i'm just gonna push your boat out into the water and let you float i mean fundamentally you know what i would say is that like i i really had stepped back like i started teaching because i knew that no one needed more of this in their lives right and i did not intend to have this career it kind of happened accidentally and that doesn't mean i had to like ride the ride once the ride was offered to me by providence you know um you know and i did and i take responsibility for that but on the other hand like you know it chose me you chose me uh and so if you want to choose someone other than me uh do that and or you know sorry choose someone in addition to me please um but again you know fatima's kitchen tick tock oh my god like you gotta go there and check her out her food is just amazing what are some staple ingredients you have in your home kitchen at all times uh so certainly canned tomatoes at all times um and people let me know let me talk about this uh why canned tomatoes right uh people ask me this a lot like why you know you wouldn't use like canned green beans or canned squash or something right like why would you use canned tomatoes well there's actually like a pretty you know clear reason for that which is that uh you know modern grocery store fresh tomato varieties have been bred for hardiness so that they will arrive at your grocery store unblemished and unsquished like a tomato is a naturally very delicate thing in a way that a green bean isn't you know i mean green beans get worse after they're picked too but it's not like a tomato like a real fresh heirloom tomato is incredibly difficult to deliver to the grocery store unsquished okay so what you're getting when you buy fresh tomatoes in the store are like things that have had they didn't i don't they probably didn't try to breed all the flavor out of them but it's just incidental that when they were breeding them to be um uh uh uh to be tough right um they lost like all their flavor so um canned tomatoes are varieties that do not have to be intact and cosmetically perfect by the time you see them right because they get peeled and then put in the can and they're squished and pushed around and they potentially even ground or crushed before you even ever see them right so they are in the ones in the cans are or at least can be much more delicate but flavorful varieties and it's also the case that like what do you do with canned tomatoes you generally like cook them and squish them anyway in which case like the fact that they're already kind of wet and squished and partially cooked because remember canning process always involves some amount of cooking doesn't really matter right whereas like with you know green beans most people want like al dente green beans right and you just you're not going to be able to get those from the can you're not going to be able to get the experience of a fresh tomato from a can either but that's not what you want like a lot of the time when you eat tomatoes right like half the time you eat tomatoes you want to make a sauce or a stew kind of situation with them in which case canned tomatoes are fine so for all of these reasons canned tomatoes are fantastic and it's not just san marzano's that are great anymore like there's so many good varieties out there that are really high quality i would um you know i'm not not a paid endorsement but mirror glenn uh the maker that they're growing in the san joaquin valley in california um and those things are amazing is it san joaquin or is it i don't know i'm gonna go with san joaquin uh i think that's correct thanks okay and uh so canned tomatoes number one always don't get caught without them anything else i feel like that's a long enough answer i feel like you did a whole tick tock there on canned tomatoes well i did just do a tick tock on canned tomatoes but that was the long version i will say one of the things that i found really great about being on tiktok and and having to post because i'm i'm part of the tic toc partner program right so like ticktock pays me right um to to post five a week or something like that um for 20 a month something and uh one of the things that's like great about that i think has really made my youtube channel better is that it allows me to kind of test stuff out to do put out a short piece of content look at the comments and see what people are asking about they're confused about maybe a way that i said something is confusing or there's an important thing that i left out or maybe i just made a bad argument right and they helped me understand the flaws of the argument right um i've found that to be tremendously useful and so like the rift that i just did on canned tomatoes includes a whole bunch of information that people are asking about on my tick tock right now because i didn't say it in the tic tac and part of that is that just tic tocs have a maximum 60 seconds i can't fit everything in but it's also just that like you know that's sort of a more immediate medium and i'll i can kind of work out bugs on tick tock and get them cleaned out before you see them what's been the most challenging part of your youtube career so far certainly at first it was dealing with commenters um and you're both a sensitive person and a naturally combative person and so those two things combined made it very hard for you do not go well together those things and so far like a lot of people say that like there's there's a narrative out there that like oh the reason adam or guccio used to flip his lid at commentaries is because he was a professor and so he he was used to like never having his authority challenge no i've been like this my entire life on the internet and like you know and you can get so you can go back like look at my very early work long before i ever had a captive audience of tuition paying kids and you know i was always somewhat uh pugnacious shall we say with commenters um so that was tough but i've i've pretty well moved past that i don't really i don't really engage or even look very much anymore um so what's tough now is like nothing i mean it's the best job ever it's tough in the sense that it's very labor-intensive work and i have chosen and i think i've decided that like at least for this foreseeable future i don't i don't want to bring anyone else into my creative process i don't want to hire a video editor those of you who keep like um offering your services as a video editor thank you very much i'm sure that you would be awesome um i'm sorry it's just for me i feel like adam is a one-man band yeah it's hard for for me to get him to let me assist him he is very much a lone wolf and part of it is just that like i feel like i would i would it would take so much effort to coordinate with another human that i'm not even sure would be worth it right like um it's so there's so many things i can do with sort of a shorthand because i know i know that i'm the only one who's gonna deal with it like i can i don't have to i don't have to kind of leave like if i was going to shoot for someone else to edit i would have to be much more intentional about certain things and making it clear this is what i used that this is what i intended this shot for this is how i intended it to be used blah blah or it could just be that i'm terrible at working with other people right um maybe that's true i mean like i like i think i work well with other people in the context of like you know i i i could i could you know i've worked at companies and i think been a pretty good co-worker i just i'm not good at working on in an actual project level work collaborating on a single maid object with another human i've never been good at that um and so i think that would be tough and it's also i just i believe that like i think that one of the things that you like about this is that like it is sort of rugged and handmade and it's just a guy in his kitchen with a camera and not like a whole crew which is not to disparage those people doing this who have crews because they're doing wonderful stuff and a lot of them get way more views than i do so they're obviously doing something right but i kind of think that you know one of the things that's good about what i do is that or chef john too you know is that it's like it's just chef john and his camera right and there's an authenticity to that that is really special i think both things are good there but they are different things what is your methodology for finding scholarly articles and acquiring research for your monday videos as someone that hates doing research this fascinates me sure um so you know to a certain extent there's it's just doing doing research of any kind but especially looking at scholarly sources it's kind of like um developing your palette for food right nothing can replace experience of simply just having dealt with all kinds of sources for a long time and just developing a sense of like what is reputable and what's not um and there's really nothing that can replace just time and experience in that sense but um in terms of looking at scholarly sources you know the first thing to do is to kind of like you know um well actually here here's here's a really good uh trick um if you are at a university um or a big company that has an institutional account for a product called web of science which is a sort of a search tool for scholarly research oh my god use that it's amazing because one of the things that it does is that it it's really good at kind of showing you um it's surfacing widely cited research that is research that hasn't just been published in some journals somewhere because all kinds of crazy stuff gets published um but look at surfacing stuff that has been published and then cited by other authors right which is sort of a validating step and showing you exactly how much it has been cited and then showing you where it has been cited which is a thing you always have to check because sometimes things get cited not because they're good but because they're bad and there's all kinds of like methodological problems with it that other writers are saying oh my god don't ever do this now to assume like the worst stuff tends to get retracted by the journal right and that's one of the advantages of looking at stuff that's published in actual professional journals as opposed to self-published research a disadvantage of looking at stuff that's published in reputable professional journals is that it's often not free and again if you if you're at a university or something you probably have access free access to a whole lot of scholarly journals like learn how you can access that via your library or your library's website um but you know for me um i just pay for it you know because you have been you know kind enough to provide me with a really great living here and so i feel like if if if anyone's gonna actually pay for this stuff it's going to be someone like me so i just pay for it right um but like that's that's a barrier that you might have um public libraries can also help you oh god yes yes yeah yeah public libraries dear god um so uh you know google scholar is a great place to start it's it's generally gonna only surface pretty recent research um for you um and but it's good it kind of and it'll it'll definitely surface a lot more kind of open access journals that is kind of free journals or places where the scientists themselves have published their work even if it's already published in a professional paywall journal they might just put it on their own website or on researchgate or something like that so google scholar is a great place to start but you can't you can't stop there a lot of stuff is not on google scholar um but i feel like i'm leaving out all kinds of things i mean look for look for actual bibliographies that librarians have made you know that's a thing that research librarians do is they assemble bibliographies or lists of sources with annotations on a specific topic you can find that all over the place find an article a good article that's on the topic that you want and then look at its work cited and trace backwards that's why those works those footnotes and stuff are there right and then the you know the really big one is um wikipedia for god's sake like don't denigrate it just because it's a secondary source just look at the primary sources at sites go down to the cited works and examine those sources directly before you judge uh the wikipedia article article would you consider doing a video oh wait no sorry oh this is interesting you can cut this out um but it's somebody saying doing a video on quote starvation foods in various countries i.e spam haggis black pudding corned beef etc wow that is a good idea yeah yeah and not just like i mean those are all like starvation foods is a little a little little rough because those are all really good foods but like actual things that people have eaten under really really severe uh deprivation like grasses and mosses and stuff that people resorted to things that people that were traditionally quote unquote like poor people food that now are suddenly like chefs are bringing back and making fancy versions of but like yeah spam is great haggis is excellent yeah that's a good idea i'll do that cool um okay how does your family friends former co-workers feel about your youtube career um honestly most people see they don't care i mean they're like oh that's nice for you yeah but so yeah most people most people don't care that much right like well at least they don't they say they don't um among like my my friends and former colleagues who are like media people who are you know they came from the worlds that i worked in um you know at least what they tell me is that my story is very um inspiring to them in a way that like gives them happiness and hope right the idea that um especially for journalists whose work has been so profoundly devalued by the marketplace and all of my friends have been laid off at least once um i think that they derive some hope from seeing that like journalism skills are valuable and applicable in places that aren't you know just newspapers or whatever right um and so i've been told by a lot of people exactly that that it gives them kind of hope and inspiration and i'm i feel good about that i'm sure some of them also just hate me um and and sorry and i understand what i think is most interesting about this and it as a person who watches you know youtube or tick tock or whatever there are people that in your mind you're like well that person's really famous and well known and look at their a million subscribers or more but but that's just amongst their niche audience and most people are like who know huh yeah exactly yeah yeah that's the thing i mean internet fame is very different from real fame and for that i am grateful god you know i find internet fame to be unpleasant enough in a lot of respects um but like god real fame that would just be miserable you know the the money would be cold comfort i think yeah that's why when people are like do you think adam's ever gonna get a food network show i'm like i kind of hope not yeah this level of fame is great yeah i will say i mean it's like people people say that a lot like when is this man gonna get his own show and i'm like i i have a show um secondly like yeah i can't i i mean i'm not saying that like i mean if if you have a business proposal please get in touch with colin west um uh my my representation but but um i i can't imagine any gig being better than this i mean what is better than this i get to do exactly what i want whenever i want for as long as i want and enough people watch it for me to a feel like i'm having a positive impact in the world and b to make a good living so what's better than this like don't ain't broke don't fix it good lord my mom did used to look every day to see you your numbers climb higher and she was very excited when you got to a million that's an after million she was like well what am i going to do now we're still waiting for 1 million 234 thousand five hundred and sixty seven that's going to be the big benchmark that's when the party is gonna pop off let me tell you so hit that sub button thank you all right so i had to pick this question oh did you you had to you just had to it's not a bad question you're gonna love it what tips would you have to dress up s'mores since the pandemic started my roommates and i have been obsessive about s'mores going so far going so far as to make them completely homemade we would love to see your theory on how to properly roast a marshmallow over a fire or in a standard oven or pressure cooker and i picked this because what you all don't know about adam is that s'mores is perhaps his favorite flavor profile yeah and that whenever there is a s'mores flavored anything i always buy it so we can try it yeah he's almost always disappointed because the marshmallow flavor is never forward enough yeah it's always just gram and chocolate but uh but yeah so talk about some more sure yeah love them and that's that's a whole i mean there's this is a video that i want to do is like why why why is there a marshmallow flavor like there shouldn't be it's just sugar and yet there's something more specific about it and yeah it's gelatin but i don't think you can actually taste gelatin i don't think there's any perceivable taste uh compounds in gelatin that's purely a textural component so why does mar i mean there is like a marshmallow taste there's a thing what is that i don't understand it um similar with like uh like cotton candy or um just lots of candy things that seem to have flavors even though they're just sugar what's up with that i'm really curious about that um but yeah absolutely love s'mores i think i could do like a s'mores video that seems like a good thing to do out on the fire on a crisp winter night so i'll work on that um i don't have any particular theories for you it's cool i guess it sounds like maybe you're making the graham crackers yourself with that's another video i need to do is like graham crackers like what the hell is that who was graham that's a really weird story um and uh but you're making it from scratch that sounds like fun i imagine you're not coaching your own chocolate um so the most obvious thing would be to simply experiment with different kinds of chocolate beyond just the kind of traditional hershey bar though i love the traditional hershey bar um certainly you could you know the issue is that it's like it's already not a very structurally sound thing and so you can't be putting like very wet things in there or things that are going to melt and reese's cups are good in there yeah reese's cups would be great that's because peanut butter and marshmallow already goes together in a fluffernut yeah and there's a i don't know if they're still on the market but they were for a while reese's was making thin reese's cups those would probably be great inside a s'more it is funny when i talk about like hershey's chocolate on the internet and i get so many just snobby europeans being like american chocolate like i don't know what accent that was you know i think that was john cleese being a frenchman um but uh yeah they get all snobby about it although by the way they'll often say you gotta get some galaxy chocolate i mean that's the real [ __ ] brits will say that a lot um guess what galaxy is american it's dove it's dove chocolate from chicago illinois this is rebranded as galaxy in europe sorry anyways also everyone in europe really likes the cookies and cream hershey bar yes exactly they love there's two things that europeans will say they actually will like grudgingly say they love about american chocolate making which is the the hershey's cookies and cream bar and reese's cups and legit like a reese's cup is a that is a fine confection like if you if you got that like hand you know artisan handmade from some shop like you would think oh my god this is one of the greatest things ever and it is even when it's not from an artisan handmade shop it's just one of the greatest desserts i'd argue it's better when it's like anytime you get like an organic fancy racist cup it's never as good as the sort of gritty interior what is that it's so good surely it's partially just sugar crystals right um it might also be salt i mean the saltiness of it is just is so much of what makes it that salty peanut butter um god yeah i should i should see if they would let me do a video about that see how many of the trade secrets they'd tell me i'm gonna guess none certainly someone has reverse engineered it right there's got to be like copycat recipes for reese's cups out there i don't know there's no comparable you know like competing chocolate company who's made a good version of a reese's cup like reese's cups stand alone yeah anyway i bet nutella would be good in a s'more too but i'll do a s'mores video thank you oh this is another one that might be a video but i don't know um how do we think oh and i suggested this to you the other day how do we think of blue as a flavor and what flavor is it really i.e blue gatorade blue snow cone i just want to know who was the first person to say to deem something blue raspberry yeah yeah yeah well it's pretty like you i think we can make a pretty solid guess at that basically it was just that red was already taken by cherry and what else might what are the candy flavors red strawberry yeah um and watermelon potentially right that's pink so pink okay there's just there's just like two there's just too many red fruits and so when some candy maker wanted to introduce a raspberry flavor to their lineup and they were like well what what how do we color this to make it distinct they were like well what's left because there is no blue food right blueberries aren't blue they're purple there's no blue food so they is there really no blue food can you think of it blue cheese yeah bring me all the blue cheese flavored gummy bears in the land and even then i haven't i don't know i haven't really like looked at it it's blue the fungus in blue cheese is blue is it real sometimes it's green but is for also for sure blue okay that may be it i mean like legit um so surely that's historically how blue raspberry happened by the way i look forward to a cascade of comments of people telling you about blue foods in this video because i know they're coming right um and blueberries are great hey uh um friends of desoto um please no comments about klingon food they'll know what that means anyway i think you should do a video about that's great lovely the first person who was like blue raspberry and it will be sour and kind of cut your tongue yeah yeah yeah that's i mean that's one of those videos that i kind of want to do as soon as we can it's safe to like travel again and people from georgia are allowed other places um because there's like you know there's this section of the new jersey of the new jersey turnpike where like the the birth of the artificial flavor industry was like right along there and that to this day there's still all of these plants along the new jersey turnpike making like half of the artificial flavorants that are used in the industry worldwide something like that it's all still there and it's why like you get some really weird smells if you open up your window i feel like there's a metaphor in artificial flavoring coming from new jersey yeah i bet bruce springsteen has already given you a song somewhere unironically new jersey was the cradle of a whole lot of the 20th century's innovations um and 19th century i mean where was where was thomas edison you know respect to new jersey respect new jersey what's your process for finding out what you want to order at a new restaurant do you just have a preferred dish and order that restaurant's variant or do you read the entire menu to see what catches your eye so the first thing i think you always want to try to figure out is like is there a dish that you know what what is this restaurant known for like what is their jam you know and generally it's like that isn't even really if you go to a nice place these days they're kind of not going to put anything on the menu that isn't there jam but it certainly used to be i mean when when we were kids restaurant culture was still pretty different and it was still you know the early um the early days of the modern restaurant industry were all about offering you the maximum amount of variety and that was like that was what was um that was what was cool about going out to eat at del monaco's or one of the really kind of early modern restaurants was that the menu had hundreds of items on it and you could have whatever you wanted as opposed to eating at home or someone else's house where like you could only have the one thing the one pheasant that they made that night right is what everyone was going to eat the one bowl of risotto that everyone is going to eat that was what was novel about going to your restaurant is you get anything right and i think some of that was still around when we were kids i remember restaurants having just wait way too much stuff on the menu and like half of it would be frozen right and i feel like the restaurant industry has really has matured so much over the course of my lifetime to the point where like nice places have much shorter menus and they're only putting on their what they're good at um but within that i still would kind of be like i you know ask a survey or a server like what is the thing what is their what are they known for here what are they what do they do really really well you know what's the place thing i i can get here that i can't get elsewhere um and a lot of that would be like looking at like local products and seeing you know seeing um seeing what they have on the menu that is from nearby and then after that i would just kind of it's a different variation to the same question like what can i assuming that everything here is like the chef's special and it's all local and blah blah what can i get here that i can't make easily for myself at home or get at just any other restaurant and that will generally kind of guide me this is why adam a never orders pasta at a restaurant yeah never and we basically never go to italian restaurants i would love to go to a big sloppy you know new jersey red sauce italian place again and that's something that's on my to-do list when the pandemic is over for sure i mean i actually i will get pasta like a really it has to be like a really nice place um and they're for sure making the pasta fresh yeah yeah exactly um but yeah someone just making dried pasta i mean no no knock against dried pasta dry pies is amazing i mean it's arguably better than fresh pasta in many ways but i feel there's absolutely no reason to order it from a restaurant like you can do it just as well yourself at home um and and it'll be way cheaper like but you know a nice nice fresh pasta from a really good restaurant you know i'll order that for sure um so i picked this last question because we can sort of look to the future and have some hope um which i think we're all starting to need but also feel yeah um have you ever thought about doing a food tour outside the u.s maybe after coke oh my god i'm so excited because it's like you know i think i've said this before but like my plan when i quit my university job was to like do like every other video would be on the road it would be somebody hey buddy can you go out in the living room for a second we're almost done no he says do you want to snapchat okay bye we'll be done in just a second okay do you need do you need to can you do you need anything oh no no no you can't come in here because you might trip i think he's trying to get the party blower you can get it do you want the blower no no okay well as long as you're not in the shot you can be here okay go ahead you can take it okay it's coping so we got kids at home during the day bye yeah that's exactly he wanted the party blower that's what he wanted it was lauren's birthday uh last night happy birthday lauren oh thank you so uh yeah like i you know i mean i i don't think that my cooking is that interesting or worth learning about like i really wanted like certainly every other recipe video to be someone else's recipe and i wanted to be traveling around gathering awesome stuff you know and then this happened so i want to get back to that kind of concept as soon as possible um you know it's it's looking like you know we could get vaccinated as soon as you know in a couple of months yeah i'm hoping next summer we can start going out and doing more things yeah it's great um and by the way everyone should get vaccinated oh for god's sake get vaccinated and also for god's sake all the people who are not in the united states who leave shitty comments about how dumb americans are and like yeah america's got like a lot of problems and our government especially is particularly dumb at the moment but where did the vaccine first get developed who was first to finish it oh no two american companies okay didn't the oxford vaccine get finished at the same time like around the same time but it was i think it was third okay don't don't don't be a jerk what i want to say is that you know adam and i will for sure be getting the vaccine and we encourage you to get vaccinated if you are medically able yes um and we will get vaccinated for the people who are not medically able yes bill gates is not trying to put a microchip in your brain also he already knows about your brain and if he wants to know anything about you he'll give you all the comments you've put on this here internet he already knows okay uh please is this video gonna get demonetized for covet information i don't think so just get vaccinated for god's sake so we can all get back to things and yeah i'd so i so it kind of you know my plan is to sort of travel to a place um and bank a crap ton of material i'll just go go to mexico city and get you know material for 20 videos you know um and then roll those out over some great length of time because i can't be like traveling once a week like we have a family right but i can be traveling maybe once once a month and banking a bunch of material um and there's so many things i want to do we would love to accompany you on many of those trips yeah there's also i mean just like road trip stuff around the us that we haven't been able to do i mean we live you know we i would love to go to texas and do some barbecue and some you know southwest tex-mex videos and and one of you know one of the good things about the united states is business expenses are tax deductible that is you're not taxed on the income that you then spent on the business expense and this is a totally justifiable business expense i mean this is how i make my living and you definitely you definitely pay me enough to spend a lot of money on travel and get more cool stuff for cool videos for you so like i'm just thrilled to let the to just do do what comes natural um i want i wanna i mean we love scotland and i can't wait to go to scotland and do like a scotch whiskey how it's made kind of thing uh people have asked if i could do uh worcestershire sauce worcestershire sauce worcester sauce i love whiskey speaking for shepherd's pie right being a shepherd's pie load that up with worcestershire i will say that like that's a trade secret and they they will only tell you so much but they might they might show me some although actually you you know that most of it for the american market is made at a factory in in new jersey so isn't it made by craft i don't think so i feel like there's was there's a fame maybe it's not but one of the brands that everybody buys at the grocery mondelez might have acquired it i i don't know um anyways um so i could just go to new jersey to do that video um but it still requires travel right so all of that there's so many exciting things to do there's like things that aren't just you know specifically like food or food production related but are more kind of culture related like i i you know i want to do a video about how um how how the norman conquest affected how we talk about food and food words in the english language and i would love to go to normandy to do that video um all kinds of fun stuff so get excited and just get the damn shot for god's sake when it's available all right well that was the last question is there anything else that you wanted to add over the din of cartoons coming from the ipad it's just uh you know stay healthy keep wearing your mask um and you know help is on the way and uh thanks for watching thank you,3

Exclusive Holiday Discount/Free U.S....",2022-12-01 14:47:05.187352, chocolate coconut tart this is a really easy yet fancy dessert recipe i came up with while experimenting with coconut fats coconut oil makes beautifully crumbly pastry crusts and coconut cream makes an exceptionally smooth chocolate ganache with a cooling mouth feel and totally incidentally this recipe is vegan that's just a bonus as far as i'm concerned i wasn't trying to make it vegan first thing is make the crust it's something between a short crust pastry and a crumbly cracker crust like a cup of all-purpose flour 120 grams but this is not a fussy pastry it does not have to be precise half a cup of sugar 100 grams and then like 50 grams or half a cup of almond flour for some extra flavor and crumbly texture though you could use an equivalent amount of coconut shreds for example if you want to double down on the coconut thing you could replace this with just more ap flour or if you have celiac you could use solid almond flour for this now you could use cold butter but i'm using coconut oil virgin coconut oil like this gets you a nice subtle coconut flavor refined coconut oil will have almost no flavor at all and it should be solid like this at room temperature if it's not solid your kitchen is probably too warm chill the oil in the fridge before you cut it into the dough it needs to be solid i've got half a cup of coconut fat in there that's eight tablespoons about 110 grams last thing is salt i like to have a nice salty crust on a chocolate tart half a teaspoon of morton kosher is what i'm using that's two or three grams you could use more and you could throw all that into the food processor and just pulse it until it's like a coarse breadcrumb consistency or you could do it the old-fashioned way with a pastry cutter or a fork you just cut the tines of the fork into the big chunks of solid fat as you cut those chunks into smaller chunks they immediately get covered in flour and such which disperses the fat bits it keeps them from sticking together again it'll feel like you're doing absolutely nothing but keep at it and all of a sudden you'll have that coarse breadcrumb consistency if you can squeeze it and it just barely holds a solid shape that is done that is what gives you a crumbly or short pastry if you want something a little more flaky you can pick up handfuls of this and do that with them to squeeze out long sheets of fat coated in flour aka flakes but this will still be pretty crumbly because we're not actually going to roll this out and because there's no water in this dough coconut oil is nearly 100 fat unlike butter which is like 15 water that water reacts with gluten to make a more elastic dough there's no water at all in this so this pastry is going to be super brittle which is what i'm after it's like a graham cracker crust and you can simply mold this into a normal pie or cake pan it'll be delicious but you would not be able to cut out nice pretty slices for that you need a tart pan with a removable bottom these things are cheap and you can just lift the tart up out of the pan when it's done my recipe is calibrated for this pretty standard nine inch diameter size 23 centimeters or it could work with four of these mini guys that i'm going to use four and a half inches wide with these little ones each person gets their own tarts and there's more edge crust relative to the total volume which means fewer bites will be exactly the same heterogeneity i'm just pushing the crumbs into the molds my recipe gives you a very thick crust layer it's equal parts crust and ganache because that's what i'm into you can make less crust if you wanted try to push it into the corners and make sure it's not too thick down there in the corner it's going to melt a bit in the oven and slump down into the corner so if it's too thin in the corners when it goes in the oven it'll be just right on the way out you could use a measuring cup or a glass or something to really stamp these out smooth but i don't think that makes a really noticeable difference in the end and there's the four tartlets how was that not the name of a motown group we'll bake them empty at 350 fahrenheit 180c baking them on a tray will make it easier to get them out when they're hot and the tray will catch any melting pastry that would otherwise fall and burn now there's nothing really to do but clean up might as well listen to some tunes by this remarkable undiscovered talent on soundcloud i mean wow and he sounds great via the sponsor of this video cove audio whom i'll now briefly thank this is the cove commuter 2 just the best darn bluetooth speaker you can imagine it syncs with your phone or computer or whatever in a flash the controls are really simple and obvious and i wonder how this visionary soundcloud composer would sound in true wide stereo [Music] that's how amazing there's a 30 foot range between these two halves you can charge them simultaneously up to seven hours of playtime on a charge it's water resistant which is great for kitchen use there's a built-in microphone and it gets darn loud apart or reunited if you follow my link in the description you can save more than 67 on the commuter too making it far more affordable than any comparable speaker i've seen and remember it's basically a two-for-one deal because it has two speakers link is in the description for 67 off thank you cove after 15 or 20 minutes the pastry shells should be kind of molten and bubbly this is not the kind of pastry that will stick all the way up the sides of the tart pan so don't expect it to you could pull these right now or you could bake them a little longer until they brown a bit the browning tastes delicious but it can also drown out the subtle flavor of the coconut and it can make the pastry harder to cut with a fork pick your poison i will say if you want a stronger coconut flavor you could add a few drops of coconut flavoring to the dough or the ganache i tried that i liked it but lauren thought it tasted like sunscreen anyway you got to let these cool all the way down before you fill them wait until they're ready then make the ganache filling you could use a product labeled coconut milk or coconut cream i'm using the cream it's the same stuff as the milk except it will have more of this luscious fat floating in the can above the layer of coconut water at the bottom and i'm just lifting the semi-solid cream out of the can and dropping it into a microwave-safe measuring jug i'm looking for one cups worth 240 mils if you don't have enough of the cream to get you that much you can top it off with the coconut water you've left behind that's fine the more coconut water you have in there the more soft the ganache will be which is not an inherently good or bad thing now for the chocolate it's the star of the show so use a chocolate you really like either chips or chop up a bar into chunks ganache is generally equal parts cream traditionally dairy cream of course and chocolate you can easily measure that volume of the chocolate by displacement just mix in enough that you've got two total cups of stuff in there almost 500 mils but it does not have to be precise easiest way to make ganache is to just throw it in a microwave on like half power for a minute or two just long enough until you can melt it together i usually wait until i see the first signs of melting chocolate and then i take it out and stir it should look like it's not quite hot enough yet because if you keep stirring it and spreading around the heat it will go smooth at a surprisingly low temperature this is good because if you get it too hot it can kind of seize up and go grainy taste it you could call that done or you could put in a little dab of vanilla or almond extract or any flavoring you like you might also want it sweeter depending on your tastes and how dark your chocolate was to begin with you can stir in a little granulated sugar but it's safer to squeeze in a little syrup any syrup granulated sugar could give you a gritty texture don't make it too sweet because the crust is plenty sweet i think the filling should taste a little too intensely chocolatey in isolation this last step will be a lot easier if you do it directly in the fridge you just fill the tarts all the way to the brim it doesn't matter if you go higher than your walls of crust filling these in the fridge saves you from having to transfer them in while they're full and soft and sloshing around you would spill a lot look how pretty that is and then just chill these until they're solid a couple hours at least but they'll be firmer if you chill them overnight like i did there they are the next day now these are too cold for you to push the tart up out of its ring right now the crust and ganache is still stuck to the sides get yourself a wide flat vessel and pour in a thin layer of hot tap water stick the tart in there and within seconds that will melt the stuff clinging to the ring and you can easily lift the tart out get a knife in there to lever off the bottom piece or don't bother just serve it right on the base that water trick works great if you just left these on the counter until soft the whole tart would be too warm by the time you could de-pan it you could put some raspberries or something on there for fancy or not i prefer a light sprinkling of smoked sea salt crazy good you can also tap on a little bit of powdered sugar that's pretty but do it right before you eat because that thing is cold so there's going to be condensation forming on it which will dissolve the sugar and that looks kind of ugly i prefer the smoked sea salt now especially if you browned the crust it's gonna be a little tough to push your fork through because it's so cold and thick you might instead consider putting it on a cutting board and cutting it into little wedges like a wheel of brie just wipe the knife clean in between each cut this turns it into a finger food which makes it a nice thing for people standing around at a party or something that's just so tasty and again i feel like that coconut milk ganache has a cooling mouth feel as though it's working on my thermoreceptors the same way that something like mint does am i just making that up well you try this recipe and you tell me,3
